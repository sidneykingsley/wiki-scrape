firstnameplaceholder James secondnameplaceholder III (born July 6, 1975),[3] known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American rapper, songwriter, television producer, actor, and entrepreneur. Known for his impact in the hip hop industry, he has been described as a "master of the nuanced art of lyrical brevity".[4][5]Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, secondnameplaceholder began selling drugs at age 12 during the 1980s crack epidemic. He later began pursuing a musical career and in 2000 he produced Power of the Dollar for Columbia Records, but days before the planned release he was shot and the album was never released. In 2002, after 50 Cent released the compilation album Guess Who's Back?, he was discovered by Eminem and signed to Shady Records, under the aegis of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.With the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album Get Rich or Die Tryin'), 50 Cent became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence as de facto leader of East Coast hip hop group G-Unit. In 2003, he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. 50 Cent had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, The Massacre, which was released in 2005. He underwent musical changes by his fifth album, Animal Ambition (2014), and as of 2021, is working on his sixth album, Street King Immortal. He executive-produced and starred in the television series Power (2014–2020) and is slated to produce its spin-offs.[6]50 Cent has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards.[7] As an actor, secondnameplaceholder appeared in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005), the war film Home of the Brave (2006), and the crime thriller film Righteous Kill (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s and the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly) by Billboard.[8] Rolling Stone ranked Get Rich or Die Tryin' and "In da Club" in its lists of the "100 Best Albums of the 2000s" and "100 Best Songs of the 2000s" at numbers 37 and 13, respectively.[9][10]
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, and raised in its South Jamaica neighborhood[3] by his mother Sabrina. A drug dealer, Sabrina raised secondnameplaceholder until she died in a fire when secondnameplaceholder was 8.[11][12] After his mother's death and his father's departure, secondnameplaceholder was raised by his grandmother.[13]He began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14, a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. "When I wasn't killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling crack on the strip," secondnameplaceholder remembered.[14] He sold crack during primary school.[15] "I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too ... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like they're the champ."[16]At age 12, secondnameplaceholder began dealing narcotics when his grandparents thought he was in after-school programs[17] and brought guns and drug money to school. In the tenth grade, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew secondnameplaceholder High School: "I was embarrassed that I got arrested like that ... After I got arrested I stopped hiding it. I was telling my grandmother [openly], 'I sell drugs.'"[18]On June 29, 1994, secondnameplaceholder was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine, and a starting pistol. Although secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp and earned his GED. He has said that he did not use cocaine himself.[13][19][20] secondnameplaceholder adopted the nickname "50 Cent" as a metaphor for change.[21] The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as "50 Cent"; secondnameplaceholder chose it "because it says everything I want it to say. I'm the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means."[22]
<h2>Career</h2>
secondnameplaceholder began rapping in a friend's basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals.[23] In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records.[24][25] secondnameplaceholder's first appearance was on "React" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut 'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks,[16] and Jay produced secondnameplaceholder's first (unreleased) album.[12] In 1999, after secondnameplaceholder left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks;[11] eighteen were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar.[26] secondnameplaceholder founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang 'Em Smurf.[27][28]secondnameplaceholder's popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single "How to Rob", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio.[21][29] The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. secondnameplaceholder explained the song's rationale: "There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant".[21] Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track,[29] and Nas invited secondnameplaceholder to join him on his Nastradamus tour.[30] Although "How to Rob" was intended to be released with "Thug Love" (with Destiny's Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the "Thug Love" music video, secondnameplaceholder was shot and hospitalized.[31]On May 24, 2000, secondnameplaceholder was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard.[citation needed] secondnameplaceholder returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. secondnameplaceholder was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek.[12][18][32] His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice;[18][30][33] his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where secondnameplaceholder spent thirteen days. The alleged attacker, Darryl Baum, Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard,[34] was killed three weeks later.[35]secondnameplaceholder recalled the shooting: "It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'"[18] In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: "After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone".[13] secondnameplaceholder used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.[12][18][36]In the hospital secondnameplaceholder signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, "Ghetto Qu'ran". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada.[37][38] With business partner Sha Money XL, secondnameplaceholder recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that secondnameplaceholder used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: "He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them."[39] secondnameplaceholder's popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who's Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.[26]In 2002, Eminem heard secondnameplaceholder's Guess Who's Back? CD, received from secondnameplaceholder's attorney (who was working with Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg).[31] Impressed, Eminem invited secondnameplaceholder to fly to Los Angeles and introduced him to Dr. Dre.[12][24][31] After signing a $1 million record deal,[24] secondnameplaceholder released No Mercy, No Fear. The mixtape featured one new track, "Wanksta", which appeared on Eminem's 8 Mile soundtrack.[26] secondnameplaceholder was also signed by Chris Lighty's Violator Management and Sha Money XL's Money Management Group.[citation needed]50 Cent released his debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin' (described by AllMusic as "probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade"), in February 2003.[40] Rolling Stone noted its "dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce", with secondnameplaceholder complementing the production in "an unflappable, laid-back flow".[41] It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 872,000 copies in its first four days.[42] The lead single, "In da Club" (noted by The Source for its "blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps"),[43] set a Billboard record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week.[44]Interscope gave secondnameplaceholder his own label, G-Unit Records, in 2003.[45] He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as members of G-Unit, and The Game was later signed in a joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. In March 2005, 50 Cent's second commercial album, The Massacre, sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days (the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle[42]) and was number one on the Billboard 200 for six weeks.[46] He was the first solo artist with three singles in the Billboard top five in the same week with "Candy Shop", "Disco Inferno" and "How We Do".[47] According to Rolling Stone, "50's secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus".[48]After The Game's departure secondnameplaceholder signed Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records, with Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joining the label, who all eventually departed the label.[49][50] secondnameplaceholder expressed an interest in working with rappers other than G-Unit, such as Lil' Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J of Def Jam, Mase of Bad Boy and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, and recorded with several.[51]In September 2007, 50 Cent released his third album, firstnameplaceholder, which was inspired by his life before Get Rich or Die Tryin'.[52] It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 691,000 copies during its first week.[53] It sold behind Kanye West's Graduation, released the same day; the outcome of this highly-publicized sales battle between secondnameplaceholder and West has been accredited to the commercial decline of the gangsta rap and "bling era" style that previously dominated mainstream hip-hop.[54]On the September 10, 2008 episode of Total Request Live, secondnameplaceholder said his fourth studio album, Before I Self Destruct, would be "done and released in November". He released "Ok, You're Right", produced by Dr. Dre for Before I Self Destruct, on May 18, 2009 and was scheduled to appear in a fall 2009 episode of VH1's Behind the Music. On September 3, 2009, secondnameplaceholder posted a video [55] for the Soundkillers' Phoenix-[56] produced track, "Flight 187", introducing his mixtape and book (The 50th Law). The song, with lyrics inspiring speculation about tension between secondnameplaceholder and Jay-Z, was a bonus track on the iTunes version of Before I Self Destruct.[57] Before I Self Destruct was released on November 9, 2009.In a Contactmusic.com interview, secondnameplaceholder said he was working on a Eurodance album, Black Magic, inspired by European nightclubs: "First they played hip-hop which suddenly changed to uptempo songs, known as Eurodance".[58] He later said he had changed his next album to The Return of the Heartless Monster after writing different material when he returned home from the Invitation Tour in 2010, shelving Black Magic.[59][60] On September 3, secondnameplaceholder supported Eminem on his and Jay-Z's The Home & Home Tour, performing "Crack A Bottle" with Eminem and Dr. Dre amid rumors of tension between secondnameplaceholder and Dre.[61][62]He "recorded 20 songs to a whole different album concept" before putting them aside,[63] wanting his new album to have the "aggression" of Get Rich or Die Tryin'.[64][65] secondnameplaceholder tweeted that the album was "80 percent done" and fans could expect it in the summer of 2011. It was ultimately delayed a year due to disagreements with Interscope Records, with secondnameplaceholder saying that he would release it in November 2011[66] with a different title than Black Magic.[66] Eminem would appear on the album, and secondnameplaceholder said he was working with new producers such as Boi-1da and Alex da Kid.[67] Cardiak, who produced Lloyd Banks' "Start It Up", confirmed that he produced a song for the upcoming album.[68]secondnameplaceholder released a song, "Outlaw", from his fifth album on the Internet on June 16, 2011.[69] The single, produced by Cardiak, was released on iTunes on July 19[70] (although secondnameplaceholder tweeted that it was not the album's first single).[71] The rapper planned to write a semi-autobiographical young-adult novel about bullying, different from his previous books which focused on his life and the rules of power. According to the book's publisher, the first-person novel (about a 13-year-old schoolyard bully "who finds redemption as he faces what he's done")[72] was scheduled for publication in January 2012.In a series of tweets, secondnameplaceholder said that the delay of his fifth album was due to disagreements with Interscope Records,[66] later suggesting that it would be released in November 2011 with his headphone line (SMS by 50).[66] He speculated to MTV News about not renewing his five-album contract with Interscope: "I don't know ... It will all be clear in the negotiations following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether you still want to stay in that position or not."[73]On June 20, 2011, secondnameplaceholder announced the release of Before I Self Destruct II after his fifth album.[74] Although he planned to shoot a music video for the fifth album's lead single, "I'm On It", on June 26[75] the video was never filmed.[76] secondnameplaceholder told Shade45, "I did four songs in Detroit with Eminem. I did two with Just Blaze, a Boi-1da joint, and I did something with Alex da Kid. We made two that are definite singles and the other two are the kinds of records that we been making, more aimed at my core audience, more aggressive, more of a different kind of energy to it."[77] He released "Street King Energy Track #7" in September 2011 to promote Street King, his charity-based energy drink.[78] An announcement that secondnameplaceholder was shooting a music video for "Girls Go Wild", the fifth-album lead single featuring Jeremih, was made on September 28, 2011.[79][80]secondnameplaceholder's fifth album, Street King Immortal, was initially scheduled for a summer 2012 release and postponed until November 13.[81][82] Disagreements with Interscope Records about its release and promotion led to its temporary cancellation.

It's also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don't want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money."[86]That day, he announced that Animal Ambition would be released on June 3[87] and released its first track. The song, "Funeral", was released with a video on Forbes.com. Produced by Jake One, it is a continuation of "50 Bars" from a previous album; two more tracks were scheduled for release on March 18.[88] At South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, secondnameplaceholder performed "Hold On" from the new album.[89] That song and "Don't Worry 'Bout It" were released with accompanying videos on March 18.[90] According to secondnameplaceholder, prosperity would be a theme of the album: "This project, I had to search for a concept, a really good concept, in my perspective, and that was prosperity.

The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to rapper Rick Ross's ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man.[166] In addition, secondnameplaceholder lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where secondnameplaceholder invested more than $2 million.[167] An ex-partner accused secondnameplaceholder of later stealing the design of the "Sleek by 50" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million.[168][169] His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than $500,000, including a 2010 Rolls Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe.[170] His expenses of $108,000 a month include $5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of $185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber, and his fitness coach.[171][172]Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for $3 million and the other half for another $3 million with the sales of his albums allowing secondnameplaceholder to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution.[173] Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in secondnameplaceholder filing a $75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers.[174] He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm, of failing to "employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case."[175][176][177][178][179][180][181]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
On October 13, 1996, secondnameplaceholder's girlfriend, Shaniqua Tompkins, gave birth to son Marquise secondnameplaceholder.[187] Tompkins later sued secondnameplaceholder for $50 million, saying he promised to take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it "an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour."[188][189] The two have bickered for years, and have even taken their feud to social media many times.[190][191]Marquise's birth changed secondnameplaceholder's outlook on life: "When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn't have with my father".[192] He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the "motivation to go in a different direction".[193] Despite this, the two have endured a fractured relationship that began when secondnameplaceholder and Tompkins separated in 2008.[194] Their feud has been taken to social media numerous times, including in 2020 when secondnameplaceholder disclosed that he "used to" love his son.[195] secondnameplaceholder has a tattooed "Marquise" with an axe on his right biceps ("The axe is 'cause I'm a warrior. I don't want him to be one, though"),[38] and has "50", "Southside" and "Cold World" on his back: "I'm a product of that environment. It's on my back, though, so it's all behind me".[38]secondnameplaceholder dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire secondnameplaceholder, with her, on September 1, 2012.[196][197][198] At the age of two years, Sire modeled for Kidz Safe, a headphone brand for kids, earning $700,000 through his contract.[199]In 2005, secondnameplaceholder supported President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized Bush for a slow response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.[200] If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he said, he would have voted for the president.[201] secondnameplaceholder later said that Bush "has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I don't aspire to be like George Bush."[202] In September 2007, he told Time that although he would not endorse a candidate in 2008, he "liked Hillary [Clinton]".[203]Six months later, the rapper told MTV News that he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but had lost interest in politics.[204][205] Asked his opinion of President Obama's May 9, 2012 endorsement of gay marriage, secondnameplaceholder said, "I'm for it ... I've encouraged same-sex activities. I've engaged in fetish areas a couple times."[206] He had been criticized for anti-gay comments in the past.[207][208][209]Despite having numerous songs that reference drug and alcohol usage, secondnameplaceholder remains teetotal, citing a bad experience with alcohol as his main reason.[210][211]Forbes noted secondnameplaceholder's wealth in 2007, ranking him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry.[212] He lives in a Farmington, Connecticut, mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson,[213] listing it for sale at $18.5 million to move closer to his son (who lives on Long Island with his ex-girlfriend).[214] The mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut declared October 12, 2007 "50 Cent firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Day", honoring the rapper with a proclamation and a key to the city.[215] One of secondnameplaceholder's New York homes, purchased in January 2007 for $2.4 million and the center of a lawsuit between secondnameplaceholder and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 31, 2008 while he was filming in Louisiana.[216]In December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had lost several million dollars in the stock market and, unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, had postponed Before I Self-Destruct because of the economic downturn.[217] secondnameplaceholder won a lawsuit in November 2009 against Taco Bell over the fast-food chain's use of his name without permission.[218]In 2016, regarding his beef with Meek Mill, he commented, "You know, he's really not that bright. The easiest thing you can do is bring other people into the statements you're saying, right, while you're writing music."[219] On May 4, 2016, after making fun of a teenager who, unbeknownst to secondnameplaceholder, had a disability, he donated $100,000 to Autism Speaks.[220]secondnameplaceholder endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[221] He rejected an offer of $500,000 from the Trump campaign to make an appearance on the candidate's behalf.[222] However, he endorsed Donald Trump in 2020, due to his dislike of Joe Biden's tax plans.[223] A week later, he retracted his endorsement, saying on Twitter "Fu*k Donald Trump, I never liked him",[224] and endorsed Biden.[225]On June 29, 1994, secondnameplaceholder was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer.

According to him, he did not use cocaine.[13][20][226]secondnameplaceholder and four members of his entourage were arrested shortly before 2 a.m. on December 31, 2002, when police found a .25-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber pistol in a parked car (which they searched due to its tinted windows) outside a Manhattan nightclub. The rapper was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.[227]secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to two years' probation on July 22, 2005 for a May 2004 incident, when he was charged with three counts of assault and battery after jumping into an audience when he was hit by a water bottle.[228]secondnameplaceholder filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of Pearl River, New York, on July 21, 2007, for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a Myspace page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with "Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed". Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a "vile, tasteless and despicable" use of secondnameplaceholder's image which "quite literally call[ed] for violence against him", sought unspecified punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.[229][230]In 2008, secondnameplaceholder sued Taco Bell over an ad campaign in which it invited him to change his name for one day from 50 Cent to 79 Cent, 89 Cent, or 99 Cent, in line with pricing for some of its items, and they would donate $10,000 to the charity of his choice. The case was settled out of court.[231][232]While walking through Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in May 2016, secondnameplaceholder harassed and insulted a janitor at the airport, accusing him of being under the influence. The janitor was a hearing-impaired, autistic teenager named Andrew Farrell. The parents of the janitor had seen the viral video as disrespect and wanted to sue secondnameplaceholder for his action against their child. The lawsuit was originally over one million dollars, but the parents settled for a $100,000 donation to Autism Speaks and his apology.[233][234][235][236][237]In 2016, a judge declared that Brandon Parrott gave Dr. Dre and 50 Cent the rights to "Bamba" for the song "P.I.M.P."[238]One of his New York homes, purchased for $2.4 million in January 2007 and the center of a lawsuit between secondnameplaceholder and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 30, 2008 while he was filming in Louisiana.[216] On August 5, 2013, secondnameplaceholder pleaded not guilty to one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism in a Los Angeles County court.

<h2>Feuds</h2>
Before he signed with Interscope Records, secondnameplaceholder engaged in a public dispute with rapper Ja Rule and his label, Murder Inc. Records, saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery.[245] Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when secondnameplaceholder did not like seeing him "getting so much love" from the neighborhood.[246] At The Hit Factory in New York in March 2000, secondnameplaceholder had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound.[245][247] Rapper Black Child claimed responsibility for the stabbing, saying that he acted in self-defense when he thought someone reached for a gun.[248]An affidavit by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of Jam Master Jay and secondnameplaceholder's shooting. An excerpt read:The end of the secondnameplaceholder-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, "I'm cool. We ain't beefing no more. We'll never collaborate. That's just what it is. You don't have to be at war with somebody, but it's also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don't gotta go to war, but we're not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He's doing him, and he's not thinking about me, and I'm doing me and I'm not thinking about him."[249]On August 7, 2015, the feud between the two rappers later reignited when Ja Rule gave a feedback to a social follower via Twitter over a similar feud between Meek Mill and Drake. Enraged, secondnameplaceholder later responded with photos and comments via Instagram, only siding with Drake.[250] The feud resurfaced three years later on January 19, 2018, when Ja Rule took to Twitter, calling out 50 Cent on social media.[251] 50 cent responded by purchasing and vacating the first four rows of his concert.Although secondnameplaceholder was close to The Game before the latter released his debut album, The Documentary, they grew apart. After The Documentary's release, secondnameplaceholder felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers (such as Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.[252]secondnameplaceholder later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on Hot 97. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building.[253][254] When the situation escalated, the rappers held a joint press conference announcing their reconciliation,[255] and fans were uncertain if the rappers had staged a publicity stunt to boost sales of their recently released albums.[256] After the situation cooled,[257] G-Unit criticized The Game's street credibility and announced that they would not appear on his albums. During a Summer Jam performance The Game announced a boycott of G-Unit, which he called "G-Unot".[258]After the Summer Jam performance The Game recorded "300 Bars and Runnin'", an extended "diss" of G-Unit and Roc-A-Fella Records, for the mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 3. secondnameplaceholder responded with his "Piggy Bank" music video, with The Game as Mr. Potato Head and parodies of other rivals.[259] They have continued attacking each other, with The Game releasing two more mixtapes: Ghost Unit and a mixtape-DVD, Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin. secondnameplaceholder superimposed The Game's head on the body of a male stripper for the cover of the Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Radio Part 21) mixtape in response to The Game's pictures of G-Unit dressed as the Village People.[260] The Game, under contract to Aftermath Entertainment, signed with Geffen Records to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit (although it is claimed that secondnameplaceholder pressured Dr. Dre to fire him).[261] G-Unit member Spider Loc has insulted The Game in songs, and the latter released "240 Bars (Spider Joke)" and "100 Bars (The Funeral)" attacking G-Unit and Loc. secondnameplaceholder's response was "Not Rich, Still Lyin'", mocking The Game.[262] Lloyd Banks replied to the Game on a Rap City freestyle-booth segment, followed by a Game "diss" song ("SoundScan") ridiculing the 13-position drop of Banks' album Rotten Apple on the Billboard 200 chart and its disappointing second-week sales. Banks replied on his mixtape Mo' Money In The Bank Pt. 5: Gang Green Season Continues with "Showtime (The Game's Over)", said that secondnameplaceholder wrote half of The Documentary and ridiculed The Game's suicidal thoughts.[citation needed]In October 2006, The Game made a peace overture (which was not immediately answered) to secondnameplaceholder,[263] but two days later he said on Power 106 that the peace offer was valid for only one day.[264] In several songs on Doctor's Advocate, he implied that the feud was over. He said in July 2009 that the feud had ended with help from Michael secondnameplaceholder and Diddy,[265] and apologized for his actions.[266] According to Tony Yayo, neither secondnameplaceholder nor G-Unit accepted his apology[267] and The Game has resumed his calls for a "G-Unot" boycott at concerts. secondnameplaceholder released "So Disrespectful" on Before I Self Destruct, targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck.[268] The Game responded with "Shake", poking fun at the music video for secondnameplaceholder's "Candy Shop".On August 1, 2016, 50 Cent ended his twelve-year feud with The Game when the two were in the Ace of Diamonds Strip Club and The Game said "What happened, that shit was 12 years ago."[269]Although Rick Ross began a feud with secondnameplaceholder over an alleged incident at the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards, secondnameplaceholder told news sources he did not remember seeing Ross there.[270] Later that month Ross' "Mafia Music" was leaked on the Internet, with lyrics apparently disparaging secondnameplaceholder. Several days later, secondnameplaceholder released "Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)" in response to "Mafia Music". The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem's Sirius channel) and told secondnameplaceholder to come up with something better in 24 hours.Before leaving for Venezuela, secondnameplaceholder uploaded a video ("Warning Shot") and the first of a series of "Officer Ricky" cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed "Tia", the mother of one of Ross' children; according to her, Ross is in reality a correctional officer.[271] On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station KUBE. Asked about the dispute between secondnameplaceholder and Ross, he sided with secondnameplaceholder and offered to mediate: "Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man" and "50 eating you, boy."[272]On his album Deeper Than Rap, Ross refers to secondnameplaceholder in "In Cold Blood" and secondnameplaceholder's mock funeral is part of the song's video. When the song was released, Ross said that he ended secondnameplaceholder's career.[273] "Rick Ross is Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He's Albert," secondnameplaceholder replied in an interview. "It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer's perspective such as "Freeway" Ricky Ross."[274] Their feud rekindled at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, where secondnameplaceholder and G-Unit members Kidd Kidd, Mike Knox, Tony Yayo were seen on video attacking Gunplay (a member of Ross' Maybach Music Group). Gunplay's Maybach Music diamond necklace was stolen during the brawl, and several days later secondnameplaceholder appeared at a Washington, D.C. bowling alley wearing Gunplay's chain.[275] On January 30, 2013, secondnameplaceholder tweeted that Ross' attempted drive-by shooting on his birthday three days earlier was "staged".[276]On August 9, 2020, 50 Cent and Rick Ross ended their feud.[citation needed]

She achieved success in Sweden after the release of her self-titled debut album in 1968, and reached international stardom as a member of the pop group ABBA,[1] which has sold over 380 million albums and singles worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists in history.[2]After the break-up of ABBA, secondnameplaceholder found success with three albums and a leading role in a movie as a solo artist in the 1980s, though she became more solitary in the 1990s, avoiding outside publicity[3] and residing[4] on the Stockholm County island of Ekerö.[5] secondnameplaceholder stopped recording music for 16 years until she released a new album in 2004.[6][7] She returned again in 2013 with A, her highest UK charting solo album to date.[8][9]
<h2>Life and career</h2>
Agneta Åse secondnameplaceholder was born in Jönköping, Sweden on 5 April 1950.[10][11][12] She was the first of two daughters of department store manager Knut Ingvar secondnameplaceholder (1922–1995) and his wife Birgit Margareta Johansson (1923–1994).[12][6] Ingvar showed much interest in music and show business,[13] and Birgit devoted herself to her children and household.[14] secondnameplaceholder's younger sister, Mona, was born in 1955.secondnameplaceholder wrote her first song at the age of six, entitled "Två små troll" ("Two Little Trolls").[15] In 1958, she began taking piano lessons, and also sang in a local church choir.[12] In early 1960, secondnameplaceholder formed a musical trio, the Cambers, with her friends Lena Johansson and Elisabeth Strub. They performed locally in minor venues and soon dissolved due to a lack of engagements.[12] At age 15, secondnameplaceholder decided to leave school and pursue a career.[12]secondnameplaceholder cites Connie Francis, Marianne Faithfull, Aretha Franklin and Lesley Gore as her strongest musical influences.[12]secondnameplaceholder worked as a telephonist for a car firm while performing with a local dance band, headed by Bernt Enghardt.[12] The band soon became so popular that she had to make a choice between her job and her musical career. She continued singing with the Bernt Enghardt band for two years.[12] During that time, secondnameplaceholder broke up with her boyfriend Björn Lilja; this event inspired her to write a song, "Jag var så kär" ("I Was So in Love"), that soon brought her to media prominence.[12][14] At that time, Karl Gerhard Lundkvist, a relative of one of the band's members, retired from his successful rock and roll career and began working as a record producer at Cupol Records. Enghardt sent him a demo recording of the band, but Lundkvist only showed interest in secondnameplaceholder and her song.[14] She was worried because he was not interested in the band and they were not to be included on the record. However, she decided to accept the offer, and signed a recording contract with Cupol Records.[12]Her self-penned début single "Jag var så kär" was recorded on 16 October 1967 and released through Cupol Records the following month. It topped the Swedish Chart on 28 January 1968 and sold more than 80,000 copies.[12] She also submitted the song "Försonade" ("Reconciled") to Melodifestivalen, the Swedish preliminary for the Eurovision Song Contest, but it was not selected for the final.[14] secondnameplaceholder developed a career as one of Sweden's most popular pop music artists, participating in a television special about Swedish composer Jules Sylvain in 1969.[16] The same year, she released the single "Zigenarvän" ("Gypsy Friend") about a young girl attending a Gypsy wedding and falling in love with the bride's brother. Its release coincided with a heated debate about Gypsies in the Swedish media, and secondnameplaceholder was accused of deliberately trying to make money out of the situation by writing the song.[15]secondnameplaceholder's success continued throughout the late 1960s. She met German songwriter/producer Dieter Zimmerman, to whom she became engaged.[12] Her albums thus reached the German charts, and Zimmerman promised her she would achieve great success in Germany.[12] However, when she went there and met with record producers, the venture was not productive; secondnameplaceholder refused to meet the demands of the producers, describing their chosen material as "horrible".[12] She soon ended her engagement to Zimmerman and returned to Sweden.[12]In 1970, she released "Om tårar vore guld" ("If Tears Were Gold"). A Danish composer claimed that she used 22 bars from his composition "Tema" ("Theme"), even though it  was written in the 1950s and had never been recorded. The case dragged on until 1977, when a settlement was reached and secondnameplaceholder paid the Danish musician SEK 5,000.[citation needed]In 1972, secondnameplaceholder portrayed Mary Magdalene in the Swedish production of the international hit musical Jesus Christ Superstar.[14]secondnameplaceholder met Björn Ulvaeus, a member of the Hootenanny Singers, for the first time in 1968, and then again in 1969.[14] Her relationship with Ulvaeus, as well as her friendship with Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson, with whom Ulvaeus had already written songs, eventually led to the formation of ABBA. secondnameplaceholder and Ulvaeus married on 6 July 1971 in the village of Verum, with Andersson playing the organ at their wedding.[12] Their first child, Linda Elin Ulvaeus, was born on 23 February 1973, and their son Peter Christian Ulvaeus on 4 December 1977.[citation needed] After seven years of marriage, the couple decided to separate in late 1978, and filed for divorce in January 1979. The divorce was finalised in July 1980. Both secondnameplaceholder and Ulvaeus agreed not to let their failed marriage interfere with their responsibilities with ABBA.[12][14] The failure of their marriage inspired Ulvaeus to write the lyrics of "The Winner Takes It All".[12][14]As a member of ABBA, secondnameplaceholder was also known as Anna in some countries.[17] In 1975, during the same period as her bandmate Anni-Frid Lyngstad recorded her Swedish number one album Frida ensam, secondnameplaceholder recorded and produced her solo album Elva kvinnor i ett hus. These albums were both recorded between sessions and promotion for the ABBA albums Waterloo and ABBA.[citation needed] secondnameplaceholder's album spent 53 weeks on the Swedish album chart (longer than any of ABBA's albums), but failed to reach the Top 10, peaking at No.11. It contained three further Svensktoppen entries for secondnameplaceholder: her Swedish-language version of ABBA's "SOS" (also No. 4 on the single sales chart); "Tack För En Underbar Vanlig Dag"; and "Doktorn!". With the exception of "SOS", all the songs had lyrics by Bosse Carlgren and music by secondnameplaceholder herself. The creation of the album had been underway since 1972, when secondnameplaceholder started writing the songs, but it was delayed because of the work with ABBA and her pregnancy.[citation needed] In 1974, secondnameplaceholder and Carlgren had agreed on a concept for the album; it should consist of 12 songs, each sung by 12 different female characters living in the same apartment building, however in the end only 11 songs were featured on the album, and the concept wasn't fully developed.Between the years 1968 and 1980, secondnameplaceholder had a total of 18 entries on the Svensktoppen radio chart, starting with the debut single "Jag Var Så Kär" in January 1968 (peak position No. 1) and ending with "När Du Tar Mig I Din Famn" ("When You Take Me in Your Arms") from the compilation Tio år med firstnameplaceholder in January 1980 (peak position No. 1). These 18 entries, most of which were composed or co-written by secondnameplaceholder herself, spent a total of 139 weeks on the chart during this time, with the biggest hit being 1970's "Om tårar vore guld" (No. 1, 15 weeks).[citation needed] secondnameplaceholder also recorded the Swedish Christmas album Nu tändas tusen juleljus with daughter Linda Ulvaeus which peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in December 1981. Chartwise secondnameplaceholder was the most successful solo artist of the four ABBA members, both before, during and after the band's international career.[18][19]secondnameplaceholder participated in Melodifestivalen again, albeit only as a composer. In 1981, she wrote the ballad "Men Natten Är Vår" ("But the Night Is Ours") with lyrics by Ingela Forsman, but instead of performing the song in the contest herself, she chose new talent Kicki Moberg. The song placed 9th out of 10. The single, which secondnameplaceholder produced in the Polar Studios with the same musicians as on contemporary ABBA recordings, was backed with the Swedish version of "I'm Still Alive", entitled "Här Är Mitt Liv" ("Here Is My Life"), a song which she herself had performed in its English version (lyrics by ex-husband Björn Ulvaeus) during ABBA's 1979 world tour.[citation needed] Moberg's recording of the song remains the only version to have been officially released to date.[20]secondnameplaceholder sang solo parts in the following ABBA songs: "Disillusion" (the only ABBA song to have been written by her, lyrics by Björn), "I Am Just A Girl", "Hasta Mañana", "Dance (While the Music Still Goes On)", "SOS", "I've Been Waiting For You", "When I Kissed The Teacher", "My Love, My Life", "Take A Chance On Me", "The Name Of The Game", "Move On", "Thank You For The Music", "Get On The Carousel", "Chiquitita", "Lovelight", "As Good As New", "Kisses Of Fire", "Dream World", "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", "The Way Old Friends Do", "The Winner Takes It All", "Happy New Year", "Lay All Your Love On Me", "Head Over Heels", "One Of Us", "Soldiers", "Slipping Through My Fingers", "Just Like That" (never officially released in its entirety by the group), "I Am The City", "Under Attack" and "The Day Before You Came".Although no official announcement was made, ABBA effectively disbanded in late 1982 to early 1983. At the end of 1982 secondnameplaceholder duetted with Swedish singer (and former ABBA backing vocalist) Tomas Ledin on a song called "Never Again", which became a Top Five hit in Sweden, Norway, Belgium, and South America.[citation needed] The song was also released in a Spanish-language version, entitled "Ya Nunca Más". In the summer of the same year, secondnameplaceholder had a leading role in the Swedish movie Raskenstam.[citation needed]In May 1983, secondnameplaceholder released her first post-ABBA solo album, Wrap Your Arms Around Me, produced by Mike Chapman. The album became a moderate hit in North America and Australia, but reached the higher regions of the charts across Europe, including No. 1 in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, and Denmark (where it became the biggest-selling album of the year), top 5 in Germany, The Netherlands and France and No. 18 in the UK.[21] The album achieved sales of 1.5 million copies in the first year.[22] Two singles from the album became hits in continental Europe: "The Heat Is On" became a No. 1 hit in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Belgium and No. 2 in The Netherlands and Germany. The song peaked at No. 35 in the UK (and was secondnameplaceholder's highest charting and only UK Top 40 hit until 2004).[23] The album's title track reached No. 1 in Belgium and peaked at No. 4 in the Netherlands.[24] In North America, the album track "Can't Shake Loose" was released as the lead-off single, reaching No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart,[25] and No. 23 on the RPM Top 50 singles chart in Canada.[citation needed]secondnameplaceholder's next studio album, Eyes Of A Woman, produced by Eric Stewart of 10cc, was released in March 1985. "She is quite content to grace the works of various other lesser mortals with her immaculate, sugar-sweet voice," wrote Barry McIlheney in Melody Maker. The album sold well in parts of Europe, peaking at No. 2 in Sweden and reaching the Top 20 in Norway and Belgium, but scraped into the UK Top 40 just for one week.[26] The album sold up to 800,000 copies. The self-penned lead single "I Won't Let You Go" achieved moderate success in Europe, reaching No. 6 in Sweden, No. 18 in the Netherlands and No. 24 in West Germany.[24]In 1986, secondnameplaceholder recorded another duet, "The Way You Are", with Swedish singer Ola Håkansson, which became another No. 1 hit in Sweden and Norway.[citation needed]In early 1987, secondnameplaceholder recorded an album Kom följ med i vår karusell ('Come Join Us On Our Carousel') with her son Christian. The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. For the album firstnameplaceholder recorded duets with her son and a children's choir. In 1988, it was nominated for Swedish music prize Grammis in a category 'Barn' (For Children).[27]In the summer of 1987, secondnameplaceholder travelled to Malibu, California, to record her fourth post-ABBA solo album, I Stand Alone, produced by Peter Cetera (formerly of the band Chicago) and Bruce Gaitsch, who had collaborated on Madonna's La Isla Bonita. Released in November of that year, I Stand Alone was a minor hit in Europe, except in Sweden where it spent eight weeks at No. 1 and became the best-selling album of 1988.[28] More than 300,000 copies were sold throughout Scandinavia. According to Hans Englund, the Swedish head of WEA, more than 800,000 copies were sold globally.[29] However, chart-wise outside of Scandinavia, the results were less impressive.[24][30]The single "I Wasn't The One (Who Said Goodbye)", on which secondnameplaceholder duetted with Peter Cetera, was released primarily in North America, and became her second solo single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 93.[25] It was also a Top 20 Billboard Adult Contemporary hit. The track (along with "The Last Time" as "La Última Vez") was also recorded in Spanish for the Latin American market as "Yo No Fui Quién Dijo Adiós". secondnameplaceholder refused to promote the album in major TV shows in West Germany, but she made a promotional visit to London in February 1988, appearing on the Terry Wogan Show.[citation needed]Following the release of I Stand Alone, secondnameplaceholder had a 17-year hiatus from the music industry, during which she made few public appearances and devoted much of her time to astrology, yoga and horse riding at her isolated country house in Ekerö.[31]In 1990, secondnameplaceholder married Swedish surgeon Tomas Sonnenfeld, but the couple divorced in 1993.[32]In 1994, secondnameplaceholder's mother committed suicide by jumping from her Jönköping apartment balcony. secondnameplaceholder's resulting depression worsened a year later when her father died.[6]In 1997, secondnameplaceholder started a relationship with a Dutch forklift driver, Gert van der Graaf. After secondnameplaceholder decided to terminate the relationship in 1999, he stalked her further at her mansion, resulting in a court issuing Van der Graaf with a restraining order and deporting him to the Netherlands in 2000. Returning close to her home in 2003, he was arrested and then banned from entering Sweden.[33] In 2005, the ban order from Sweden ran out, and within months Van der Graaf was again sighted near secondnameplaceholder's estate in Ekerö.[34]In 1996, her autobiography Som jag är was published in Swedish (and in English the following year titled As I Am), followed by several compilation CDs of her Swedish and English recordings, including one called My Love, My Life for which secondnameplaceholder picked out the music herself. Fans welcomed the autobiography. The book was updated in 1998 and released worldwide via Virgin Publishing, selling over 50,000 copies.In April 2004, secondnameplaceholder released a new single, "If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind" (a cover of the song originally recorded by Cilla Black). It peaked at No. 2 in Sweden and became secondnameplaceholder's highest charting UK single to date, reaching No.11.[35][36] One week later, the album My Colouring Book, a collection of secondnameplaceholder's covers of 1960s classic oldies, was released, topping the chart in Sweden, hitting the Top Five in Finland and Denmark, and peaking at No. 6 and No. 12 in Germany and the UK respectively.[37][38] The title track, "My Colouring Book", is a cover of the song originally recorded by Barbra Streisand. The Observer suggested that "time hasn't diminished her perfect voice."[39] Reviewing the release in The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan wrote: "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder has a vulnerability that gets under the skin of a song. She may be cheating a trifle by including no original material on this collection of 1960s covers, but if anyone can do justice to the likes of "Sealed with a Kiss", it's her. The soaring sentimentality evokes Cilla Black and Sandie Shaw in their mini-skirted pomp, and I don't say that lightly."[40] The release attracted media attention across Europe, but secondnameplaceholder staunchly refused to be involved in any extensive promotion of the album.[citation needed]A second single release from the album, "When You Walk in the Room", peaked at No.11 in Sweden and entered the UK Top 40 at No. 34 (which was still higher than any of her UK singles in the 1980s).[41] "Sometimes When I'm Dreaming", originally recorded by Art Garfunkel, failed to be released as the third single.Shortly after this release, for the 2004 semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest, staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, secondnameplaceholder appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled "Our Last Video." All four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did the singer and actress Cher and comedian Rik Mayall.[citation needed]In 2004, secondnameplaceholder was nominated for Best Nordic Artist at the Nordic Music Awards, and at Christmas of that year she gave an extensive interview (her first for many years) which was filmed by Swedish TV.[42] Around the same time, Sony Music released a lavishly produced 6-CD boxed set comprising secondnameplaceholder's Swedish solo career (mostly before ABBA), with five original solo albums: 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, and her 1975 album recorded and released during her time with ABBA – plus an additional compilation disc with bonus tracks.In 2005, secondnameplaceholder appeared with her former bandmates at the opening of the Mamma Mia! musical in Stockholm, and together with ex-husband Björn, also attended the final show in January 2007.In October 2008, a new compilation album, My Very Best, was released in Sweden. The double CD contains both Swedish (CD 1) and English-language hits (CD 2) from her whole solo career, from 1967 to 2004. It reached No. 4 on the Swedish album chart and was certified gold within its first week of release.[43]On 4 July 2008, secondnameplaceholder joined her former bandmates at the Swedish premiere of the film version of Mamma Mia!, held at the Rival Theatre (owned by Andersson) in Mariatorget, Stockholm.[citation needed] secondnameplaceholder arrived with Lyngstad and movie star Meryl Streep, the three dancing in front of thousands of fans before joining the film's other stars and Andersson and Ulvaeus on the hotel balcony for the first photograph of all four ABBA members together in 22 years.[44]In January 2009, secondnameplaceholder appeared onstage with Lyngstad at the Swedish Rockbjörnen Awards to receive a lifetime honorary award for ABBA.[citation needed]In February 2010, ABBA World, an extensive multimillion-pound (in monetary value) exhibition, debuted at London's Earls Court and included an extensive interview with secondnameplaceholder filmed in Sweden the previous summer.[citation needed] For the exhibition's Melbourne launch, she recorded a light-hearted opening film together with former ABBA colleague Benny Andersson, shot in Stockholm in June 2010.[45]In October 2010, secondnameplaceholder attended the opening of the Mamma Mia! musical in Denmark, with former husband, Björn Ulvaeus.[46]In May 2013, secondnameplaceholder released a new album called 'A', produced by Jörgen Elofsson and Peter Nordahl. In the UK, the first single, "When You Really Loved Someone", had previously been released for download on 11 March, with the accompanying video also released on the same day. In Germany, the first single was "The One Who Loves You Now", and it was also released for download on 11 March 2013. The album includes a duet with Gary Barlow of Take That, called "I Should've Followed You Home".[47]In June 2013, officials from Universal Records in the Netherlands said that 600,000 copies of 'A' were sold in the first two months after its release. The album managed Top 5 placings in many territories, including Sweden, Norway, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, New Zealand and Australia.[citation needed] It charted at No. 6 in the United Kingdom (her highest ever placing in that territory), and a few weeks after its release a TV special made by the BBC helped the album reach the No. 6 position in the UK album chart for a second time. The first single from the album to be released in the US, "Dance Your Pain Away", was released on 28 May 2013. The digital single included two new mixes by Smash Mode.[citation needed] "Dance Your Pain Away" was released internationally as a single on 15 July 2013.[48]On 17 May 2013, secondnameplaceholder was awarded the SKAP 2013 Kai Gullmar Memorial Award at the Stockholm release party for 'A'.[49]On 12 November 2013, secondnameplaceholder sang live on stage for the first time in 25 years at the BBC Children in Need Rocks 2013 concert in London; she sang a duet with Gary Barlow, the organiser of the event.

Although the single was released in most countries in November 2013, its release in the United Kingdom was held over. She also won Best Female Album – 6th Annual Scandipop 2014, and was nominated for the German 2014 ECHO award in the Artist Rock/Pop International category.In April 2016, a new biography of secondnameplaceholder, by Daniel Ward, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder – The Girl With The Golden Hair, was published in the UK.[51]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder had a fear of flying, which worsened during ABBA's 1979 American tour, when the band's plane, heading to Boston, Massachusetts, was short of fuel, hit a tornado and performed an emergency landing. secondnameplaceholder said in 2013 that she still needed therapy to deal with the fear. During her solo career years, secondnameplaceholder would always travel by bus, and survived a bus accident on a Swedish motorway in 1983.[52]secondnameplaceholder has reportedly suffered from stage fright, fear of crowds and open spaces, fear of heights, amongst others.[6]secondnameplaceholder's split from Ulvaeus in 1979 greatly affected her; she needed therapy. Her second marriage in 1990 to Tomas Sonnenfeld was held privately, and only became public knowledge when they divorced three years later.

<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born to Joseph Eugene "Daddy Gene" secondnameplaceholder (1927–2000) and Ruth Musick "Mama Ruth" secondnameplaceholder (1930–2017) in Newnan, Georgia, and has four older sisters. He and his immediate family lived in a small home built around his grandfather's old toolshed. The family is primarily of English descent.[4] His mother lived in the home until she died on January 7, 2017. He began writing music in 1983.[5][6] Growing up, secondnameplaceholder listened primarily to gospel music, until a friend introduced him to Gene Watson, John Anderson, and Hank Williams Jr. secondnameplaceholder attended the local Elm Street Elementary and Newnan High School, and joined the band, Dixie Steel after graduation.[6][7] When he was 27, secondnameplaceholder and his wife of six years, Denise, moved from Newnan to Nashville, Tennessee, where he hoped to pursue music full-time.[8] In 1987, secondnameplaceholder cut an album titled New Traditional at Doc's Place in Hendersonville, Tennessee, but it is extremely rare and was only released in Japan.[9]
<h2>Career</h2>
In Tennessee, secondnameplaceholder got his first job in The Nashville Network's mailroom.[8] His wife Denise was a flight attendant. While working she came in contact with Glen Campbell and requested advice for her husband. Campbell handed her his business card of his manager and told her to call,[6] which helped jumpstart his career.[10]  secondnameplaceholder eventually signed with Arista,[8] and in 1989, he became the first artist signed to the newly formed Arista Nashville branch of Arista Records.[11] Arista released secondnameplaceholder's debut single, "Blue Blooded Woman", in late 1989. Although the song failed to reach top 40 on Hot Country Songs, he reached number three by early 1990 with "Here in the Real World".[12] This song served as the title track to his debut studio album, Here in the Real World, which also included two more top five hits ("Wanted" and "Chasin' That Neon Rainbow") and his first number one, "I'd Love You All Over Again".[12] Don't Rock the Jukebox was the title of secondnameplaceholder's second album. Released in 1991, it included four number-one singles: the title track, "Someday", "Dallas" and "Love's Got a Hold on You", and the number three "Midnight in Montgomery".[12] secondnameplaceholder also co-wrote several songs on Randy Travis' 1991 album High Lonesome.[11]A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love), his third album, accounted for the number one hits "She's Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)" (which Randy Travis co-wrote) and "Chattahoochee", plus the top five hits "Tonight I Climbed the Wall", "Mercury Blues" and "(Who Says) You Can't Have It All". "Chattahoochee" also won him the 1994 Country Music Association (CMA) awards for Single and Song of the Year. In 1994, secondnameplaceholder left his management company, Ten Ten Management, which had overseen his career up to that point, and switched to Gary Overton.[13] His fourth album was titled Who I Am, and it contained four number one hits: a cover of the Eddie Cochran rockabilly standard "Summertime Blues", followed by "Livin' on Love", "Gone Country" and "I Don't Even Know Your Name". An additional track from the album, a cover of Rodney Crowell's "Song for the Life", made number six. In late 1994, Clay Walker reached number one with "If I Could Make a Living", which secondnameplaceholder co-wrote.[14] secondnameplaceholder also appeared in the 1996 "When Harry Kept Delores" episode of Home Improvement, performing "Mercury Blues".[15][16]The Greatest Hits Collection was released on October 24, 1995. The disc contained 17 hits, two newly recorded songs ("I'll Try" and "Tall, Tall Trees"), and the song "Home" from Here in the Real World that had never been released as a single.[17] These first two songs both made number one. Everything I Love followed in 1996. Its first single, the Tom T. Hall-penned "Little Bitty", took secondnameplaceholder to the top of the charts in late 1996. The album also included the number one hit "There Goes" and a number two cover of Charly McClain's 1980 single "Who's Cheatin' Who". The album's fifth single was "A House with No Curtains", which became his first release since 1989 to miss the top 10.[12]1998's High Mileage was led off by the number four "I'll Go On Loving You". After it came the album's only number one hit, "Right on the Money", co-written by Phil Vassar and Charlie Black. With secondnameplaceholder's release of Under the Influence in 1999, he took the double risk on an album of covers of country classics while retaining a traditional sound when a rock- and pop-tinged sound dominated country radio.[18] When the Country Music Association (CMA) asked George Jones to trim his act to 90 seconds for the 1999 CMA awards, Jones decided to boycott the event. In solidarity, secondnameplaceholder interrupted his own song and launched into Jones's song "Choices" and then walked offstage.[19]After country music changed toward pop music in the 1990s and 2000s, he and George Strait criticized the state of country music in the song "Murder on Music Row". The song sparked debate in the country music community about whether "traditional" country music was actually dead or not.[20]  Despite the fact that the song was not officially released as a single, it became the highest-charting nonseasonal album cut (not available in any retail single configuration or released as a promotional single to radio during a chart run) to appear on Hot Country Singles & Tracks in the Broadcast Data Systems era, beating the record previously held by Garth Brooks' "Belleau Wood."  The duo were invited to open the 2000 Academy of Country Music Awards (ACMAs) with a performance of the tune.[21] Rolling Stone commented on secondnameplaceholder's style remarking, "If Garth and Shania have raised the bar for country concerts with Kiss-style production and endless costume changes, then firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is doing his best to return the bar to a more human level."[22] After the September 11, 2001 attacks, secondnameplaceholder released "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)" as a tribute to those killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The country/soft rock song became a hit single and briefly propelled him into the mainstream spotlight; secondnameplaceholder had debuted the song at the 2001 CMA Awards and his performance was generally considered the highlight of the show. secondnameplaceholder's website crashed the next day from server requests.[23] The song came to secondnameplaceholder suddenly, and had not been scheduled for any official release, but the live performance began receiving radio airplay and was soon released as a single. It was included on his 2002 album Drive, both the live version from his CMA performance, and a radio version.secondnameplaceholder released his second Christmas album (after Honky Tonk Christmas in 1993), titled Let It Be Christmas on October 22, 2002.[24] Jeannie Kendall contacted secondnameplaceholder to do a duet, and he suggested the song "Timeless and True Love"; the song appeared on her first solo album, released in 2003.[25] In early 2006, secondnameplaceholder released his first gospel music album entitled Precious Memories. He put together the album by the request of his mother, who enjoyed religious music. secondnameplaceholder considered this album a "side project" and nothing too official, but it was ultimately treated as such. More than 1.8 million units were eventually sold.[citation needed]Just a few months later, secondnameplaceholder released his next album, Like Red on a Rose. Originally intended to be a bluegrass album, Like Red on a Rose had a different producer and sound. Keith Stegall, was notably absent from this album and instead, Alison Krauss took over the producing reins. Unlike secondnameplaceholder's previous albums, the album abandoned secondnameplaceholder's typical neotraditional country style and instead, went for a soft rock/adult contemporary sound. This move proved controversial for his fans, who accused him of abandoning his signature style in order to go for a more commercial pop route. Although critically acclaimed, the album was considered a commercial disappointment for the singer. For his next album, he went back to his country roots. Good Time was released on March 4, 2008. The album's first single, "Small Town Southern Man", was released to radio on November 19, 2007. "Country Boy", "Good Time", "Sissy's Song" and "I Still Like Bologna", were also released as singles.

Fitzgerald was killed in a motorcycle accident in mid-2007.His sixteenth studio album,  Freight Train, was released on March 30, 2010. The first single was "It's Just That Way", which debuted at No. 50 in January 2010. "Hard Hat and a Hammer" is the album's second single, released in May 2010. On November 23, 2010, secondnameplaceholder released another greatest hits package, entitled 34 Number Ones, which features a cover of the Johnny Cash hit "Ring of Fire", as well as the duet with Zac Brown Band, "As She's Walking Away". On January 20, 2011, Sony Music Nashville announced that secondnameplaceholder and his Sony-owned record label, Arista Nashville, had parted.[26] In March of that year, secondnameplaceholder announced his new deal with Capitol's EMI Records Nashville. It was a joint venture between ACR (firstnameplaceholder's Country Records) and Capitol. All records were to be released and marketed through Capitol's EMI Records Nashville label.[27]In 2012, secondnameplaceholder released the album Thirty Miles West. Three singles have been released from the album, "Long Way to Go", "So You Don't Have to Love Me Anymore" and "You Go Your Way". None of the singles reached the top 20. A tour in 2013 supported the album. secondnameplaceholder released his second gospel album, Precious Memories Volume II, on March 26, 2013. Later that same year, secondnameplaceholder released his first (and so far, only) bluegrass album, simply titled The Bluegrass Album.

In 2014, secondnameplaceholder recorded the opening credits song, "A Million Ways to Die", for the film A Million Ways to Die in the West, co-writing the song with Seth MacFarlane and Joel McNeely.[28]In August 2014, the Country Music Hall of Fame opened an exhibit celebrating secondnameplaceholder's 25 years in the music industry.

<h2>Personal life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder married his high school sweetheart, Denise secondnameplaceholder, on December 15, 1979. They have three daughters: Mattie Denise Selecman (born June 19, 1990), Alexandra Jane "Ali" (born August 23, 1993), and Dani Grace (born August 28, 1997). Although the couple separated for several months in 1998 due to the strains of secondnameplaceholder's career as well as his infidelity,[50] they have since reconciled. Their story is referenced in several of secondnameplaceholder's songs, including "She Likes It Too" and "Remember When," based on his memories, and the fond views of an everlasting love between his wife and him. Denise and their daughters appear in the latter song's video.Denise secondnameplaceholder wrote a book that topped The New York Times Best Seller list about her life with secondnameplaceholder, their relationship, their separation over his infidelity and recommitment to each other, and her commitment to Christianity. The book, It's All About Him: Finding the Love of My Life, was published in 2007. In May 2008 she released a Gift Book titled "The Road Home." secondnameplaceholder's nephew, Adam Wright, is also a country music singer-songwriter. Adam and his wife, Shannon, perform together as a duo called The Wrights.[51] The Wrights co-wrote two songs and sang harmony vocals on secondnameplaceholder's What I Do album. secondnameplaceholder is a cousin of former Major League Baseball player Brandon Moss.[52] In June 2009, secondnameplaceholder listed his 135-acre (0.55 km2) estate just outside Franklin, Tennessee, for sale, asking $38 million. The property sold in late May 2010 for $28 million, one of the highest prices ever for a home sale in the Nashville area.[53] In 2010, after secondnameplaceholder moved his estate just outside Franklin, the singer then moved into a home in the same Nashville suburb. The singer and his wife paid $3.675 million for the estate in June 2010, but less than a year later they listed the home for $3.995 million.[54]secondnameplaceholder maintained a close friendship with fellow country singer, George Jones. Jones has been mentioned in songs such as "Don't Rock the Jukebox" (Jones also appeared in the video which accompanied it) and "Murder on Music Row." The song "Just Playin' Possum" is dedicated to Jones and talks of how firstnameplaceholder only wants to lie low and play possum, possum referring to George Jones. Jones can also be seen in the video for "Good Time." In 2008, Jones was a surprise guest at secondnameplaceholder's "CMT Giants" ceremony, where he thanked secondnameplaceholder for his friendship. He's also close friends with George Strait, who sang "Murder on Music Row" with him. Besides his associations with big stars, firstnameplaceholder also maintains his connections to his roots and old friends.[55] From his early days of playing the guitar with his old high school friend and fellow musician David "Bird" Burgess on the Burgess' family front porch, it was evident firstnameplaceholder was going to be Newnan's rising star.[55] While "Bird" Burgess has left the country music scene to pursue other avenues, the two have remained friends.[55] At George Jones' funeral service, on May 2, 2013, secondnameplaceholder performed one of Jones' classics, "He Stopped Loving Her Today," at the close of the service at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. An avid classic car collector, secondnameplaceholder's collection includes an Amphicar, a 1968 Shelby GT 500 KR Convertible and a 1970 Chevelle SS 396, among others.[56]

firstnameplaceholder Nelson (April 25, 1923 – December 21, 1992), known by his stage name firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, was an American blues guitarist and singer whose playing influenced many other blues guitarists. He is perhaps best known for the popular and influential album Born Under a Bad Sign (1967) and its title track. He, B.B. secondnameplaceholder, and Freddie secondnameplaceholder, all unrelated, were known as the "secondnameplaceholders of the Blues."[1] The left-handed secondnameplaceholder was known for his "deep, dramatic sound that was widely imitated by both blues and rock guitarists."[2]He was once nicknamed "The Velvet Bulldozer" because of his smooth singing and large size–he stood taller than average, with sources reporting 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) or 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m), and weighed 250 lb (110 kg)–and also because he drove a bulldozer in one of his day jobs early in his career.[3][4]secondnameplaceholder was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1983. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2011, he was ranked number 13 on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.[5]
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on a cotton plantation in Indianola, Mississippi. During childhood he sang at a church with a family gospel group, in which his father played the guitar. One of 13 children, he grew up picking cotton on plantations near Forrest City, Arkansas, where the family moved when he was eight years old.[2]secondnameplaceholder's identity was a longtime source of confusion. He stated in interviews that he was born in Indianola on April 25, 1923 (or 1924), and was a half-brother of B.B. secondnameplaceholder (an Indianola native) but, documentation suggests otherwise. secondnameplaceholder stated that whenever he performed at Club Ebony in Indianola, the event was celebrated as a homecoming, and he cited the fact that B.B.'s father was named firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[2] However, when he applied for a Social Security card in 1942, he gave his birthplace as "Aboden" (most likely Aberdeen, Mississippi) and signed his name as firstnameplaceholder Nelson, listing his father as Will Nelson.[2] Musicians also knew him as firstnameplaceholder Nelson in the 1940s and early 1950s.He started using the name firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in 1953 as an attempt to be associated with B.B secondnameplaceholder; he was billed as "B.B. secondnameplaceholder's brother".[2] He also used the same nickname as B.B secondnameplaceholder, "Blues Boy", and he named his guitar Lucy (B.B. secondnameplaceholder's guitar was named Lucille).[2] B.B. secondnameplaceholder later said: "He called his guitar 'Lucy,' and for a while he went around saying he was my brother. That bothered me until I got to know him and realized he was right; he wasn't my brother in blood, but he sure was my brother in the blues."[6]According to secondnameplaceholder, his father left the family when firstnameplaceholder was five, and when he was eight he moved with his mother, Mary Blevins, and two sisters to an area near Forrest City, Arkansas.[4] He said his family had also lived in Arcola, Mississippi, for a time. He made his first guitar out of a cigar box, a piece of a bush, and a strand of broom wire. He later bought a real guitar for $1.25.[4] As a left-hander learning guitar on his own, he turned his guitar upside down. He picked cotton, drove a bulldozer, worked in construction, and held other jobs until he was able to support himself as a musician.[2]
<h2>Career</h2>
secondnameplaceholder began his professional work as a musician with a group called the Groove Boys in Osceola, Arkansas.[3] During this time he was exposed to the work of many Delta blues artists, including Elmore James and Robert Nighthawk.[1]In 1953, he moved north to Gary, Indiana where he briefly played drums in Jimmy Reed's band and on several of Reed's early recordings.[7] In Gary, he recorded his first single ("Bad Luck Blues" backed with "Be On Your Merry Way"), for Parrot Records.[8] The record sold a few copies, but made no significant impact and Parrot did not request any follow-up records or sign secondnameplaceholder to a long-term contract.[3] In 1954, he returned to Osceola and re-joined the Groove Boys for two years.In 1956, he moved to Brooklyn, Illinois, just across the river from St. Louis, and formed a new band.[9] He became a popular attraction around the St. Louis nightclub scene alongside Ike Turner's secondnameplaceholders of Rhythm and Chuck Berry.[10] He signed to Little Milton's Bobbin label in 1959,[11] releasing a few singles, but none of them charted. However, he caught the attention of secondnameplaceholder Records which released the single "Don't Throw Your Love on Me So Strong" in November 1961. The recording features musician Ike Turner on piano and became secondnameplaceholder's first hit; peaking at number 14 on the Billboard R&B chart.[12] The song was included on his first album The Big Blues in 1962. secondnameplaceholder left Bobbin in late 1962 and recorded one session for secondnameplaceholder Records. In 1963, He signed with jazz artist Leo Gooden's Coun-Tree label and cut two records for them, but these failed to chart.[13]With no apparent career prospects other than touring the club circuit in the South and Midwest, secondnameplaceholder moved to Memphis, where he signed with the Stax record label.[3] Produced by Al Jackson Jr., secondnameplaceholder with Booker T. & the MGs recorded dozens of influential sides, such as "Crosscut Saw" and "As the Years Go Passing By".[14] In 1967, Stax released the album Born Under a Bad Sign, a collection of the singles secondnameplaceholder recorded at Stax.[3] The title track of that album (written by Booker T. Jones and William Bell) became secondnameplaceholder's best-known song and has been covered by several artists (including Cream, Paul Rodgers, Homer Simpson, and Jimi Hendrix). The production of the songs was sparse and clean and maintained a traditional blues sound while also sounding fresh and thoroughly contemporary. The key to secondnameplaceholder's success at Stax was giving his songs an upbeat, slick R&B feel that made the songs more appealing and radio-friendly than the slow, maudlin traditional blues sound.In 1967, secondnameplaceholder was performing at Ike Turner's Manhattan Club in East St. Louis when promoter Bill Graham offered him $1,600 to play three nights at the Fillmore West in San Francisco.[15][16] He released the album Live Wire/Blues Power from one of the concerts.[7]In 1969, secondnameplaceholder performed live with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. That same year, he released the album Years Gone By. In 1970, he released an Elvis Presley tribute album, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Does the secondnameplaceholder's Things. It was a collection of Presley's 1950s hits reworked and re-imagined in secondnameplaceholder's musical style, although critics felt the results were mixed.On June 6, 1970, secondnameplaceholder joined the Doors on stage at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, Canada. Recordings of this performance were released in 2010 by Rhino Records as Live in Vancouver 1970.[17]In 1971, he released the album Lovejoy which notably includes a cover of the Rolling Stones' hit "Honky Tonk Women". To retain his popular appeal, secondnameplaceholder eagerly embraced the new sound of funk. In 1972,  he recorded "I'll Play the Blues for You," which featured accompaniment from the Bar-Kays, the Memphis Horns, and the Movement (Isaac Hayes's backing group).[7] He recorded another album with the Bar-Kays, I Wanna Get Funky (1974). He also made a cameo on an firstnameplaceholder Brooks' comedy album, A Star Is Bought (1975).[18]In 1975, secondnameplaceholder's career took a turn downward when Stax Records filed for bankruptcy, after which he moved to the small Utopia label. His next two albums, firstnameplaceholder and Truckload of Lovin' (1976), devolved into generic 1970s pop music. His third album for Utopia, secondnameplaceholder firstnameplaceholder (1977), while somewhat more subdued, still lacked any standout material, and secondnameplaceholder's guitar took a backseat to the background instruments. Clara McDaniel teamed up with secondnameplaceholder at Ned Love's Club. This led to her touring with secondnameplaceholder in the Deep South in the 1970s.[19][20] When McDaniel returned home she managed secondnameplaceholder's fleet of taxicabs. The last recording secondnameplaceholder made for Utopia was Live Blues in 1977, from his performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival. The track "As the Years Go Passing By" is noteworthy for his duet with the Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher.[21]In 1978, secondnameplaceholder moved to a new label, Tomato Records, for which he recorded the album New Orleans Heat. The label paired him with the R&B producer Allen Toussaint, who had been responsible for scores of hits in that genre in the 1960s and 1970s but was a novice at working with blues artists. The album was a mix of new songs (including Toussaint's own "Get Out of My Life, Woman") and re-recordings of old material, such as "Born Under a Bad Sign."secondnameplaceholder took a four-year break from recording after the disappointing sales of his albums in the late 1970s. During this period, he re-embraced his roots as a blues artist and abandoned any arrangements except straight 12-bar guitar, bass, drums, and piano. In 1983, he released a live album for Fantasy Records, San Francisco '83, which was nominated for a Grammy Award.[22] The same year he recorded a studio television session, more than an hour long, for CHCH Television in Canada, featuring the up-and-coming blues sensation Stevie Ray Vaughan; it was subsequently released as an audio album and later as an audio album plus DVD titled In Session.In 1984, secondnameplaceholder released the album, I'm in a Phone Booth, Baby, which was nominated for a Grammy Award.[22] The album included a redo of "Truckload of Lovin'" and two old songs by Elmore James, "Dust My Broom" and "The Sky Is Crying".secondnameplaceholder's health problems led him to consider retirement in the 1980s, but he continued regular tours and appearances at blues festivals, using a customized Greyhound tour bus with "I'll Play The Blues For You" painted on the side.[3] His final album, Red House (named after the Jimi Hendrix song) was released in 1991.At the time of his death, he was planning a tour with B.B. secondnameplaceholder and Bobby "Blue" Bland.[10] Bland told the Associated Press, "there was never any type of jealousy when we three worked together on a package. One just pushed the others."[23]
<h2>Death</h2>
secondnameplaceholder died of a heart attack on December 21, 1992, in his Memphis home.[10] His final concert had been in Los Angeles two days earlier. He was given a funeral procession with the Memphis Horns playing "When the Saints Go Marching In" and was buried in Paradise Gardens Cemetery in Edmondson, Arkansas, near his childhood home.[24]secondnameplaceholder was survived by his wife, Glendle; two daughters, Evelyn Smith and Gloria Randolph; a son, Donald Randolph; a sister, Elvie Wells; 8 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.[10]
<h2>Artistry</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's first instrument was a diddley bow. Next, he built himself a cigar box guitar, and eventually he bought a Guild acoustic guitar. The instrument he is usually associated with is a 1958 Gibson Flying V. In 1974 he began using a Flying V built by Dan Erlewine, and after 1980 he also played one built by Bradley Prokopow.[25] After 1987, firstnameplaceholder played a custom Archtop Flying V,[26] built by Tom Holmes upon commission from Billy Gibbons, it was given to secondnameplaceholder for his 64th birthday. This guitar was recently sold by Gruhn's guitar[27] to an unknown collector.secondnameplaceholder was left-handed, but usually played right-handed guitars flipped over upside-down. He used a dropped open tuning, possibly more than one, as reports vary: (C#-G#-B-E-G#-C#) or open E-minor (C-B-E-G-B-E) or open F (C-F-C-F-A-D).[28] He never used the sixth string.[25] Steve Cropper (who played rhythm guitar on many of secondnameplaceholder's Stax sessions), told Guitar Player magazine that secondnameplaceholder tuned his guitar to C-B-E-F#-B-E (low to high).[29] The luthier Dan Erlewine said secondnameplaceholder tuned to C-F-C-F-A-D with light-gauge strings (0.009", 0.012", 0.024" wound, 0.028", 0.038", 0.050"). The lighter-gauge strings, and lower string tension of the dropped tuning, were factors in secondnameplaceholder's string-bending technique.For amplification, secondnameplaceholder used a solid-state Acoustic amplifier, with a speaker cabinet containing two 15-inch speakers and a horn ("which may or may not have been operative"). Later in his career he also used an MXR Phase 90.[25]secondnameplaceholder influenced other guitarists, including Jimi Hendrix, Mick Taylor, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Mike Bloomfield and Joe Walsh (the James Gang guitarist spoke at secondnameplaceholder's funeral). He also influenced his contemporaries firstnameplaceholder Collins and Otis Rush. He was often cited by Stevie Ray Vaughan as having been his greatest influence. Eric Clapton has said that his work on the 1967 Cream hit "Strange Brew" and throughout the album Disraeli Gears was inspired by secondnameplaceholder.[23]
<h2>Accolades</h2>
Over the course of his career, secondnameplaceholder was nominated for two Grammy awards. In 1983, he was nominated for Best Traditional Blues album for San Francisco '83 and the next year he was also nominated for I'm In A Phone Booth, Baby.[22]In 1983, secondnameplaceholder was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.[2]secondnameplaceholder received a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 1993.[30]In 2011, secondnameplaceholder was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in his hometown Indianola.[2][31]secondnameplaceholder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.[32] At the induction ceremony, Gary Clark Jr. performed secondnameplaceholder's "Oh, Pretty Woman" and was then joined by John Mayer and Booker T. Jones to perform secondnameplaceholder's "Born Under a Bad Sign."[33]secondnameplaceholder was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2013.[4]

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (born Vincent Damon Furnier, February 4, 1948)[1] is an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spans over 50 years. With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords,[2] secondnameplaceholder is considered by music journalists and peers to be "The Godfather of Shock Rock".[3] He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.[4]Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called The Earwigs 1964, consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and background vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band 'firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' and released their debut album in 1969 with limited chart success. The band reached their commercial peak in 1973 with their sixth studio album, Billion Dollar Babies.[5] They broke up in 1975 and Furnier adopted the band's name as both his legal name and his stage name, beginning his solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare.secondnameplaceholder has experimented with a number of musical styles, including art rock, hard rock, heavy metal, new wave,[6] glam metal,[7][8] and industrial rock. He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and has been described as the artist who "first introduced horror imagery to rock and roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre".[9] He is also known for his wit offstage, with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world's most "beloved heavy metal entertainer".[10] Away from music, secondnameplaceholder is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur, and, since 2004, a radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Ether Moroni Furnier (1924–1987) and his wife Ella Mae (née McCart; born 1925). He was named after his uncle, Vincent Collier Furnier, and the writer Damon Runyon.[11] His father was an evangelist in The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)[12] and his paternal grandfather, Thurman Sylvester Furnier, was an apostle (from 1917) in and president (1963–1965) of that church.secondnameplaceholder was active in his church at ages 11 to 12.[13][14] Following a series of childhood illnesses, he moved with his family to Phoenix, Arizona, where he attended Cortez High School.[15] In his high school yearbook, his ambition was to be "A million record seller".[16]
<h2>Career</h2>
In 1964, 16-year-old Furnier was eager to participate in the local annual Cortez High School Letterman's talent show, so he gathered four fellow cross-country teammates to form a group for the show: Glen Buxton, Dennis Dunaway, John Tatum and John Speer.[fn 1] They named themselves the Earwigs.[17] They dressed up in costumes and wigs to resemble The Beatles, and performed several parodies of Beatles songs, with the lyrics modified to refer to the track team: in their rendition of "Please Please Me", for example, the line "Last night I said these words to my girl" was replaced with "Last night I ran four laps for my coach".[18] Of the group, only Buxton knew how to play an instrument—the guitar—so Buxton played guitar while the rest mimed on their instruments.[17][19] The group got an overwhelming response from the audience and won the talent show. As a result of their positive experience, the group decided to try to turn into a real band. They acquired musical instruments from a local pawn shop, and proceeded to learn how to play them, with Buxton doing most of the teaching, as well as much of the early songwriting.[19] They soon renamed themselves the Spiders, featuring Furnier on vocals, Buxton on lead guitar, Tatum on rhythm guitar, Dunaway on bass guitar, and Speer on drums.[17]In 1966, The Spiders graduated from Cortez High School, and after North High School football player Michael Bruce replaced John Tatum on rhythm guitar, the band released their second single, "Don't Blow Your Mind", an original composition which became a local No. 1 hit, backed by "No Price Tag".[17]By 1967, the band had begun to make regular road trips to Los Angeles to play shows.[17] They soon renamed themselves Nazz and released the single "Wonder Who's Lovin' Her Now", backed with future firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder track "Lay Down and Die, Goodbye". Around this time, drummer John Speer was replaced by Neal Smith. By the end of the year, the band had relocated to Los Angeles.[17]In 1968, the band learned that Todd Rundgren also had a band called Nazz, and found themselves in need of another stage name. Furnier also believed that the group needed a gimmick to succeed, and that other bands were not exploiting the showmanship potential of the stage.[17] They chose the name "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" largely because it sounded innocuous and wholesome, in humorous contrast to the band's image and music. In 2007 in his book firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, Golf Monster secondnameplaceholder stated that his look was inspired in part by film. One of the band's all-time favorite movies was What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? starring Bette Davis. "In the movie, Bette wears disgusting caked makeup smeared on her face and underneath her eyes, with deep, dark, black eyeliner." Another movie the band watched over and over was Barbarella. "When I saw Anita Pallenberg playing the Great Tyrant in that movie in 1968, wearing long black leather gloves with switchblades coming out of them, I thought, 'That's what firstnameplaceholder should look like.' That, and a little bit of Emma Peel from The Avengers."[20]The classic firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder group lineup consisted of Furnier, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, rhythm guitarist Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neal Smith.[17] With the exception of Smith, who graduated from Camelback High School (which is referred to in the song "Alma Mater" on the album School's Out), all of the band members were on the Cortez High School cross-country team, and many of secondnameplaceholder's stage effects were inspired by their cross-country coach, Emmett Smith.[21] secondnameplaceholder, Buxton, and Dunaway were also art students, and their admiration for the works of surrealist artists such as Salvador Dalí would further inspire their future stage antics.[22]One night after an unsuccessful gig at the Cheetah club in Venice, California, where the band emptied the entire room of patrons after playing just ten minutes, they were approached and enlisted by music manager Shep Gordon, who saw the band's negative impact that night as a force that could be turned in a more productive direction.[17] Shep then arranged an audition for the band with composer and renowned record producer Frank Zappa, who was looking to sign bizarre music acts to his new record label, Straight Records.[17] For the audition Zappa told them to come to his house "at 7 o'clock." The band mistakenly assumed he meant 7 o'clock in the morning. Being woken up by a band willing to play that particular brand of psychedelic rock at seven in the morning impressed Zappa enough for him to sign them to a three-album deal. Another Zappa-signed act, the all-female GTOs, who liked to "dress the secondnameplaceholder boys up like full size Barbie dolls", played a major role in developing the band's early onstage look.[23][fn 2]secondnameplaceholder's first album, Pretties for You (released in 1969), was eclectic and featured an experimental presentation of their songs in a psychedelic context.firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's "shock rock" reputation apparently developed almost by accident at first. An unrehearsed stage routine involving secondnameplaceholder, a feather pillow, and a live chicken garnered attention from the press; the band decided to capitalize on the tabloid sensationalism, creating in the process a new subgenre, shock rock.[17] secondnameplaceholder claims that the infamous "Chicken Incident" at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival concert in September 1969 was an accident.[17] A chicken somehow made its way onto the stage into the feathers of a feather pillow they would open during secondnameplaceholder's performance, and not having any experience with farm animals, secondnameplaceholder presumed that, because the chicken had wings, it would be able to fly.[17][24] He picked it up and threw it out over the crowd, expecting it to fly away. The chicken instead plummeted into the first few rows occupied by wheelchair users, who reportedly proceeded to tear the bird to pieces.[fn 3] The next day the incident made the front page of national newspapers, and Zappa phoned secondnameplaceholder and asked if the story, which reported that he had bitten off the chicken's head and drunk its blood on stage, was true. secondnameplaceholder denied the rumor, whereupon Zappa told him, "Well, whatever you do, don't tell anyone you didn't do it."[17][25][fn 4]The band later claimed that this period was highly influenced by Pink Floyd, and especially the album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Glen Buxton said he could listen to Syd Barrett's guitar for hours at a time.[26]Despite the publicity from the chicken incident, the band's second album, Easy Action, produced by David Briggs and released in June 1970, fared even worse than its predecessor, entirely failing to dent the Billboard Top 200. Around this time, fed up with Californians' indifference to their act, they relocated to Pontiac, Michigan, where their bizarre stage act was much better received by Midwestern crowds accustomed to the proto punk styles of local bands such as the Stooges and the MC5. Despite this, secondnameplaceholder still managed to receive a cream pie in the face when performing at the Cincinnati Pop Festival. Michigan would remain their steady home base until 1972. "L.A. just didn't get it," secondnameplaceholder stated. "They were all on the wrong drug for us. They were on acid and we were basically drinking beer. We fit much more in Detroit than we did anywhere else."[27]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder appeared at the Woodstock-esque Strawberry Fields Festival near Toronto, Ontario, in August 1970. The band's mix of glam and increasingly violent stage theatrics stood out in stark contrast to the bearded, denim-clad hippie bands of the time.[28] As secondnameplaceholder himself stated: "We were into fun, sex, death and money when everybody was into peace and love. We wanted to see what was next. It turned out we were next, and we drove a stake through the heart of the Love Generation".[29]In autumn 1970, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder group teamed with producer Bob Ezrin for the recording of their third album, Love It to Death. This was the final album in their Straight Records contract and the band's last chance to create a hit. That first success came with the single "I'm Eighteen", released in November 1970, which reached number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1971. Not long after the album's release in January 1971, Warner Bros. Records purchased firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's contract from Straight and re-issued the album, giving the group a higher level of promotion.[30]Love It to Death proved to be their breakthrough album, reaching number 35 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album charts. It would be the first of 11[fn 5] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder group and solo albums produced by Ezrin, who is widely seen as being pivotal in helping to create and develop the band's definitive sound.[31]The group's 1971 tour featured a stage show involving mock fights and gothic torture modes being imposed on secondnameplaceholder, climaxing in a staged execution by electric chair, with the band sporting tight, sequined, color-contrasting glam rock-style costumes made by prominent rock-fashion designer Cindy Dunaway (sister of band member Neal Smith, and wife of band member Dennis Dunaway). secondnameplaceholder's androgynous stage role had developed to present a villainous side, portraying a potential threat to modern society. The success of the band's single and album, and their tour of 1971, which included their first tour of Europe (audience members reportedly included Elton John and a pre-Ziggy David Bowie), provided enough encouragement for Warner Bros. to offer the band a new multi-album contract.[citation needed]Their follow-up album Killer, released in late 1971, continued the commercial success of Love It to Death and included further single success with "Under My Wheels", "Be My Lover" in early 1972, and "Halo of Flies", which became a Top 10 hit in the Netherlands in 1973. Thematically, Killer expanded on the villainous side of secondnameplaceholder's androgynous stage role, with its music becoming the soundtrack to the group's morality-based stage show, which by then featured a boa constrictor hugging secondnameplaceholder on-stage, the murderous axe chopping of bloodied baby dolls, and execution by hanging at the gallows. In January 1972, secondnameplaceholder was again asked about his peculiar name, and told talk-show hostess Dinah Shore that he took the name from a "Mayberry RFD" character.[citation needed]The summer of 1972 saw the release of the single "School's Out". It went Top 10 in the U.S. and to number 1 in the U.K., and remains a staple on classic rock radio to this day. The album School's Out reached No. 2 on the US charts and sold over a million copies. The band relocated to their new mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut.[32] With secondnameplaceholder's on-stage androgynous persona completely replaced with brattiness and machismo, the band solidified their success with subsequent tours in the United States and Europe, and won over devoted fans in droves while at the same time horrifying parents and outraging the social establishment.[citation needed] In the United Kingdom, Mary Whitehouse, a Christian morality campaigner, persuaded the BBC to ban the video for "School's Out",[33] although Whitehouse's campaign did not prevent the single also reaching number one in the UK. secondnameplaceholder sent her a bunch of flowers in gratitude for the publicity.[34] Meanwhile, British Labour Member of Parliament Leo Abse petitioned Home Secretary Reginald Maudling to have the group banned altogether from performing in the country.[35]In February 1973, Billion Dollar Babies was released worldwide and became the band's most commercially successful album, reaching No. 1 in both the US and UK. "Elected", a late-1972 Top 10 UK hit from the album, which inspired one of the first MTV-style story-line promo videos ever made for a song (three years before Queen's promotional video for "Bohemian Rhapsody"), was followed by two more UK Top 10 singles, "Hello Hooray" and "No More Mr. Nice Guy", the latter of which was the last UK single from the album; it reached No. 25 in the US.[36] The title track, featuring guest vocals by Donovan, was also a US hit single. Around this time Glen Buxton left firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder briefly because of waning health.[37]With a string of successful concept albums and several hit singles, the band continued their grueling schedule and toured the United States again. Continued attempts by politicians and pressure groups to ban their shocking act only served to fuel the myth of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder further and generate even greater public interest.[citation needed] Their 1973 US tour broke box-office records previously set by the Rolling Stones and raised rock theatrics to new heights; the multi-level stage show by then featured numerous special effects, including Billion Dollar Bills, decapitated baby dolls and mannequins, a dental psychosis scene complete with dancing teeth, and the ultimate execution prop and highlight of the show: the guillotine. The guillotine and other stage effects were designed for the band by magician James Randi, who appeared on stage during some of the shows as executioner. In 2012 at Dragon Con, Randi and secondnameplaceholder discussed their working relationship during this period.[38] The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder group had now reached its peak and it was among the most visible and successful acts in the industry. Beneath the surface, however, the repetitive schedule of recording and touring had begun to take its toll on the band.[citation needed]Muscle of Love, released at the end of 1973, was to be the last studio album from the classic lineup, and marked firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's last UK Top 20 single of the 1970s with "Teenage Lament '74". An unsolicited theme song was recorded for the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun, but a different song of the same name by Lulu was chosen instead. By 1974, the Muscle of Love album still had not matched the top-charting success of its predecessor, and the band began to have constant disagreements. For various reasons, the members agreed to take what was expected to be a temporary hiatus. "Everyone decided they needed a rest from one another", said manager Shep Gordon at the time. "A lot of pressure had built up, but it's nothing that can't be dealt with. Everybody still gets together and talks." Journalist Bob Greene spent several weeks on the road with the band during the Muscle of Love Christmas Tour in 1973. His book Billion Dollar Baby, released in November 1974, painted a less-than-flattering picture of the band, showing a group in total disharmony.[39] secondnameplaceholder later wrote an autobiography with Steven Gaines called Me, firstnameplaceholder which gave the singer's version of that era of his career, among other things.[40]During this time, secondnameplaceholder relocated back to Los Angeles and started appearing regularly on television shows such as The Hollywood Squares, and Warner Bros. released the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's Greatest Hits compilation album. It featured classic-style artwork and reached the US Top 10, performing better than Muscle of Love. However, the band's 1974 feature film Good to See You Again, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (consisting mainly of 1973 concert footage with 'comedic' sketches woven throughout to a faint storyline), released on a minor cinematic run mostly to drive-in theaters, saw little box-office success. On March 5, 1974, secondnameplaceholder appeared on episode 3 of  The Snoop Sisters playing a Satanic cult singer. The final shows by firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder as a group were in Brazil in March and April 1974, including the record indoor attendance estimated as high as 158,000 fans in São Paulo on March 30, at the Anhembi Exposition Hall at the start of the first ever South American rock tour.[41]In 1975, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder returned as a solo artist with the release of Welcome to My Nightmare. To avoid legal complications over ownership of the group name, "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" had by then become the singer's new legal name. Speaking on the subject of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder continuing as a solo project as opposed to the band it once was, secondnameplaceholder stated in 1975, "It got very basically down to the fact that we had drawn as much as we could out of each other. After ten years, we got pretty dry together." Manager Gordon added, "What had started in a sense as a pipe-dream became an overwhelming burden".[39] The success of Welcome to My Nightmare marked the final break-up of the original members of the band, with secondnameplaceholder collaborating with their producer Bob Ezrin, who recruited Lou Reed's backing band, including guitarists Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter, to play on the album. Spearheaded by the US Top 20 hit ballad "Only Women Bleed", the album was released by Atlantic Records in March of that year and became a Top 10 hit for secondnameplaceholder. It was a concept album that was based on the nightmare of a child named Steven, featuring narration by classic horror movie film star Vincent Price, and serving as the soundtrack to secondnameplaceholder's new stage show, which now showcased more theatrics than ever, including an 8-foot-tall (2.4 m) furry Cyclops which secondnameplaceholder decapitated and killed.[citation needed]Accompanying the album and stage show was the television special The Nightmare, starring secondnameplaceholder and Vincent Price, which aired on US prime-time TV in April 1975. The Nightmare (which was later released on home video in 1983 and gained a Grammy Awards nomination for Best Long Form Music Video) was regarded as another groundbreaking moment in rock history. Adding to all that, a concert film, also called Welcome to My Nightmare produced, directed, and choreographed by West Side Story cast member David Winters and filmed live at London's Wembley Arena in September 1975, was released to theaters in 1976. The film was released in a special edition DVD in 2017.[42]Such was the immense success of secondnameplaceholder's solo project that he decided to continue as a solo artist, and the original band became officially defunct. Bruce, Dunaway, and Smith would go on to form the short-lived band Billion Dollar Babies, producing one album—Battle Axe—in 1977. While occasionally performing with one another and Glen Buxton, they would not reunite with firstnameplaceholder until October 23, 1999, at the second Glen Buxton Memorial Weekend for a show at secondnameplaceholdersTown in Phoenix. They reunited for another show, with Steve Hunter on guitar, on December 16, 2010, at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix.[43] This lineup would perform together again (televised) on March 14, 2011, at the induction of the original firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder group into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as on May 11, 2011, at London's Battersea Power Station at the Jagermeister Ice Cold 4D event (webcast). Bruce, Dunaway, and Smith appeared on three tracks they co-wrote on firstnameplaceholder's 2011 album Welcome 2 My Nightmare. In 2017, they appeared on two tracks they co-wrote on firstnameplaceholder's album Paranormal, released in July, and in November they joined his current live band for five tour dates in the United Kingdom.[citation needed]Following the 1976 US No. 12 ballad hit "I Never Cry";[31] two albums, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Goes to Hell and Lace and Whiskey; and the 1977 US No. 9 ballad hit "You and Me", it became clear during his 1977 US tour that secondnameplaceholder was in dire need of help with his alcoholism (at his alcoholic peak it was rumored that secondnameplaceholder was consuming up to two cases of Budweiser and a bottle of whiskey a day). Following the tour, secondnameplaceholder had himself hospitalized in a sanitarium for treatment, during which time the live album The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Show was released.[44]In 1978, a sobered secondnameplaceholder used his experience in the sanitarium as the inspiration for his semi-autobiographical album From the Inside, which he co-wrote with Bernie Taupin; it spawned yet another US Top 20 hit ballad, "How You Gonna See Me Now". The subsequent tour's stage show was based inside an asylum, and was filmed for secondnameplaceholder's first home-video release, The Strange Case of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, in 1979. Around this time, secondnameplaceholder performed "Welcome to My Nightmare", "You and Me", and "School's Out" on The Muppet Show (episode #307) on March 28, 1978 (he played one of the devil's henchmen trying to dupe Kermit, Gonzo and Miss Piggy into selling their souls). He also appeared in an against-typecasting role as a piano-playing disco waiter in Mae West's final film, Sextette, and as a villain in the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. secondnameplaceholder also led celebrities in raising money to remodel the famous Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California. secondnameplaceholder himself contributed over $27,000 to the project, buying an O in the sign in memory of close friend and comedian Groucho Marx. In 1979, firstnameplaceholder also guest starred on good friend Soupy Sales' show, "Lunch with Soupy Sales" and was hit in the face with a pie, as part of the show ... when asked about the experience, firstnameplaceholder had this to say about his pal: "Being from Detroit, I came home every day and watched Soupy at lunch (Lunch With Soupy Sales). One of the greatest moments of my life was getting pie-faced by Soupy. He was one of my all time heroes."[45]secondnameplaceholder's albums from the beginning of the 1980s have been referred to by secondnameplaceholder as his "blackout albums" because he cannot remember recording them, owing to the influence of illicit substances. Flush the Fashion, Special Forces, Zipper Catches Skin and DaDa saw a gradual commercial decline, with the last two not denting the Billboard Top 200. Flush the Fashion, produced by Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker, had a thick, edgy new wave musical sound that baffled even longtime fans, though it still yielded the US Top 40 hit "Clones (We're All)". The track also surprisingly charted on the US dance chart.  Special Forces featured a more aggressive but consistent new wave style, and included a new version of "Generation Landslide". His tour for Special Forces marked secondnameplaceholder's last time on the road for nearly five years; it was not until 1986, for Constrictor, that he toured again. 1982's Zipper Catches Skin was a more pop punk-oriented recording, containing many quirky high-energy guitar-driven songs along with his most unusual collection of subject matters for lyrics. 1983 marked the return collaboration of producer Bob Ezrin and guitarist Dick Wagner for the haunting epic DaDa, the final album in his Warner Bros. contract.[46]In mid-1983, after the recording of DaDa, secondnameplaceholder was hospitalized for alcoholism again, and cirrhosis of the liver.[47] secondnameplaceholder was finally stable and sober (and has remained sober since that time) by the time DaDa and The Nightmare home video (of his 1975 TV Special) were released in the fall of that year; however, both releases performed below expectations. Even with The Nightmare scoring a nomination for 1984's Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video (he lost to Duran Duran), it was not enough for Warner Bros. to keep secondnameplaceholder on their books. By February 1984, secondnameplaceholder became a "free agent" for the first time in his career.[48]secondnameplaceholder spent a lengthy period away from the music business dealing with personal issues. His divorce from Sheryl secondnameplaceholder was heard at Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona, on January 30, 1984 but a decision was made by the couple not to move forward with the divorce. The following month he guested at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards alongside co-presenter Grace Jones. Behind the scenes secondnameplaceholder kept busy musically, working on new material in collaboration with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. The spring of 1984 was taken up with filming, secondnameplaceholder acting in the B-grade horror movie Monster Dog, filmed in Torrelodones, Spain. Shortly thereafter he reconciled with Sheryl; the couple relocated to Chicago. The year closed with more writing sessions, this time in New York during November with Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy.[49] In 1985, he met and began writing songs with guitarist Kane Roberts. secondnameplaceholder was subsequently signed to MCA Records, and appeared as guest vocalist on Twisted Sister's song "Be Chrool to Your Scuel". A video was made for the song, featuring actor Luke Perry and secondnameplaceholder donning his black snake-eyes makeup for the first time since 1979, but neither the song nor the video drew public interest.[50]In 1986, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder officially returned to the music industry with the album Constrictor. The album spawned the hits "He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)" (the theme song for the movie Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives; in the video for the song secondnameplaceholder was given a cameo role as a deranged psychiatrist) and the fan favorite "Teenage Frankenstein". The Constrictor album was a catalyst for secondnameplaceholder to make a triumphant return to the road for the first time since the 1981 Special Forces project, on a tour appropriately entitled The Nightmare Returns. The Detroit leg of this tour, which took place at the end of October 1986 during Halloween, was captured on film as The Nightmare Returns, and is viewed by some as being the definitive firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder concert film. It was released on DVD in 2006.[51] The concert, which received rave reviews in the rock music press,[fn 6] was also described by Rolling Stone magazine as bringing "secondnameplaceholder's violent, twisted onstage fantasies to a new generation". The Constrictor album was followed by Raise Your Fist and Yell in 1987, which had an even rougher sound than its predecessor, as well as the secondnameplaceholder classic "Freedom". The subsequent tour of Raise Your Fist and Yell, which was heavily inspired by the slasher horror movies of the time such as the Friday the 13th series and A Nightmare on Elm Street, served up a shocking spectacle similar to its predecessor, and courted the kind of controversy, especially in Europe, that recalled the public outrage caused by secondnameplaceholder's public performances in America in the early 1970s.[52]In Britain, Labour M.P. David Blunkett called for the show to be banned, saying "I'm horrified by his behaviour – it goes beyond the bounds of entertainment". The controversy spilled over into the German segment of the tour, with the German government actually succeeding in having some of the gorier segments of the performance removed.[53] It was also during the London leg of the tour that secondnameplaceholder met with a near fatal accident during rehearsal of the hanging execution sequence that occurs at the end of the show.[54]Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell were recorded with lead guitarist Kane Roberts and bassist Kip Winger, both of whom would leave the band by the end of 1988 (although Kane Roberts played guitar on "Bed of Nails" on 1989's album Trash).In 1987, secondnameplaceholder made a brief appearance as a vagrant in the horror movie Prince of Darkness, directed by John Carpenter. His role had no lines and consisted of generally menacing the protagonists before eventually impaling one of them with a bicycle frame.[55]In 1987, secondnameplaceholder also appeared at WrestleMania III, escorting wrestler Jake 'The Snake' Roberts to the ring for his match against The Honky Tonk Man. After the match was over (Roberts lost), secondnameplaceholder got involved and threw Jake's snake Damien at Honky's manager Jimmy Hart. Jake considered the involvement of secondnameplaceholder to be an honor, as he had idolized secondnameplaceholder in his youth and was still a huge fan. Wrestlemania III, which attracted a WWf record 93,173 fans, was held in the Pontiac Silverdome near secondnameplaceholder's home town of Detroit.[56]secondnameplaceholder recorded a music video for the "Poison" B-side "I Got a Line on You" after the song was featured on the soundtrack to Iron Eagle II.[57]On April 7, 1988, secondnameplaceholder nearly died of asphyxiation after a safety rope broke during a rehearsal concert wherein he pretended to hang himself, a stunt he would often perform during live concerts.[58][59]In 1988, secondnameplaceholder's contract with MCA Records expired and he signed with Epic Records. Then in 1989 his career finally experienced a legitimate revival with the Desmond Child produced and Grammy-nominated album Trash, which spawned a hit single "Poison", which reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 7 in the US, and a worldwide arena tour.[60]In 1991, secondnameplaceholder released his 19th studio album Hey Stoopid featuring several notable rock musicians guesting on the record. Released as glam metal's popularity was on the wane, and just before the explosion of grunge, it failed to have the same commercial impact as its predecessor. The same year also saw the release of the video firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: Prime Cuts which chronicled his entire career using in depth interviews with secondnameplaceholder himself, Bob Ezrin, and Shep Gordon. One critic has noted that Prime Cuts demonstrates how secondnameplaceholder had used (in contrast to similar artists who succeeded him) themes of satire and moralisation to such good effect throughout his career.[61] It was in the Prime Cuts video that Bob Ezrin delivered his own summation of the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder persona: "He is the psycho killer in all of us. He's the axe murderer, he's the spoiled child, he's the abuser, he's the abused; he's the perpetrator, he's the victim, he's the gun slinger, and he's the guy lying dead in the middle of the street".[62]During the early 1990s, secondnameplaceholder guested on records by the most successful bands of the time, such as the Guns N' Roses album Use Your Illusion I, on which he shared vocal duties with Axl Rose on the track "The Garden". He also had a brief appearance as the abusive stepfather of Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare On Elm Street film Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991).[63]secondnameplaceholder made a cameo appearance in the 1992 comedy film Wayne's World. secondnameplaceholder and his band first appear onstage performing "Feed My Frankenstein" from their album Hey Stoopid. Afterwards at a backstage party, the movie's main characters Wayne Cambell and Garth Algar discover that when offstage, secondnameplaceholder is a calm, articulate intellectual as he and his band discuss the history of Milwaukee in depth. Wayne and Garth respond to an invitation to hang out with secondnameplaceholder by kneeling and bowing reverently before him while chanting "We're not worthy! We're not worthy!"[64]In 1994, secondnameplaceholder released The Last Temptation, his first concept album since DaDa. The album deals with issues of faith, temptation, alienation and the frustrations of modern life, and has been described as "a young man's struggle to see the truth through the distractions of the 'Sideshow' of the modern world".[65] Concurrent with the release of The Last Temptation was a three-part comic book series written by Neil Gaiman, fleshing out the album's story. This was to be secondnameplaceholder's last album with Epic Records, and his last studio release for six years, though during this period the live album A Fistful of firstnameplaceholder[66] was released, and in 1997 he lent his voice to the intro track of Insane Clown Posse's The Great Milenko.[67]During his absence from the recording studio, secondnameplaceholder toured extensively every year throughout the latter part of the 1990s, including, in 1996, South America, which he had not visited since 1974. Also in 1996, secondnameplaceholder sang the role of Herod on the London cast recording of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar.[68]In 1999, the four-disc box set The Life and Crimes of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder appeared, which contained an authorized biography of secondnameplaceholder, Alcohol and Razor Blades, Poison and Needles: The Glorious Wretched Excess of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, All-American, written by Creem magazine editor Jeffrey Morgan.[69]The first decade of the 21st century saw a sustained period of activity from firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, the decade in which he would turn sixty. He toured extensively releasing a steady stream of studio albums to favorable critical acclaim. Beginning in 2000 with Brutal Planet, a return to horror-filled heavy metal, industrial rock, set in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future, inspired by our brutal modern world, and a number of current news stories appearing on CNN.[70] The album was produced by Bob Marlett, with longtime secondnameplaceholder production collaborator Bob Ezrin returning as executive producer. The accompanying world tour, which included secondnameplaceholder's first concert in Russia, also resulted in Brutally Live, a DVD of a concert, recorded in London, England, on July 19, 2000.[71]secondnameplaceholder made a guest appearance on a 2001, 3rd-season episode of That 70s Show, "Radio Daze" in which he partakes in a game of Dungeons & Dragons.[72]Brutal Planet was succeeded by the sonically similar and acclaimed sequel Dragontown, which saw Bob Ezrin back as producer. The album has been described as leading the listener down "a nightmarish path into the mind of rock's original conceptual storyteller"[73] and by secondnameplaceholder himself as being "the worst town on Brutal Planet". Like The Last Temptation, both Brutal Planet and Dragontown are albums which explore secondnameplaceholder's born again Christianity. It is often cited in the music media that Dragontown forms the third chapter in a trilogy begun with The Last Temptation;[74] however, secondnameplaceholder has indicated that this in fact is not the case.[75]secondnameplaceholder again adopted a leaner, cleaner sound for his critically acclaimed 2003 release The Eyes of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[76] Recognizing that many contemporary bands were having great success with his former sounds and styles, secondnameplaceholder worked with a somewhat younger group of road and studio musicians who were familiar with his oeuvre of old. The resulting Bare Bones tour adopted a less-orchestrated performance style that had fewer theatrical flourishes and a greater emphasis on musicality.[77]secondnameplaceholder's radio show Nights with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder began airing on January 26, 2004, in several US cities. The program showcases classic rock, secondnameplaceholder's personal stories about his life as a rock icon and interviews with prominent rock artists.[78] The show is broadcast on nearly 100 stations in the US and Canada, and has been broadcast internationally[79]A continuation of the songwriting approach adopted on The Eyes of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was again adopted by secondnameplaceholder for his 24th studio album Dirty Diamonds, released in 2005. Dirty Diamonds became secondnameplaceholder's highest charting album since 1994's The Last Temptation at the time.[80] The Dirty Diamonds tour launched in America in August 2005 after several European concerts, including a performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland on July 12. secondnameplaceholder and his band, including Kiss drummer Eric Singer, were filmed for a DVD released as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: Live at Montreux 2005. One critic, in a review of the Montreux release, commented that secondnameplaceholder was to be applauded for "still mining pretty much the same territory of teenage angst and rebellion" as he had done more than 30 years previously.[81]In December 2006, the original firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder band reunited to perform six classic firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder songs at secondnameplaceholder's annual charity event in Phoenix, entitled "Christmas Pudding".[fn 7]On July 1, 2007, secondnameplaceholder performed a duet with Marilyn Manson at the B'Estival event in Bucharest, Romania.[82] The performance represented a reconciliation between the two artists; secondnameplaceholder had previously taken issue with Manson over his overtly anti-Christian on-stage antics and had sarcastically made reference to the originality of Manson's choosing a female name and dressing in women's clothing.[70] secondnameplaceholder and Manson have been the subject of an academic paper on the significance of adolescent antiheroes.[83]In January 2008, secondnameplaceholder was one of the guest singers on the new Avantasia album The Scarecrow, singing the 7th track "The Toy Master". In July 2008, after lengthy delays, secondnameplaceholder released Along Came a Spider, his 25th studio album. It was secondnameplaceholder's highest charting album since 1991's Hey Stoopid, reaching No. 53 in the US and No. 31 in the UK. The album, visiting similar territory explored in 1987's Raise Your Fist and Yell, deals with the nefarious antics of a deranged serial killer named "Spider" who is on a quest to use the limbs of his victims to create a human spider. The album generally received positive reviews from music critics, though Rolling Stone magazine opined that the music on the record sorely missed Bob Ezrin's production values.[84] The resulting Theatre of Death tour of the album (during which secondnameplaceholder is executed on four separate occasions) was described in a long November 2009 article about secondnameplaceholder in The Times as "epic" and featuring "enough fake blood to remake Saving Private Ryan".[citation needed]During this period secondnameplaceholder was also recognized and awarded in various ways: given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003;[85] in May 2004 he received an honorary doctoral degree from Grand Canyon University.[86] In June 2005, he was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.[87] In May 2006 he was given the key to the city of firstnameplaceholder, North Dakota.[88] He won the living legend award at the 2006 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards event;[89] and he won the 2007 Mojo music magazine Hero Award.[90] He received a Rock Immortal award at the 2007 Scream Awards.[91]In January 2010, it was announced that firstnameplaceholder would be touring with Rob Zombie on the "Gruesome Twosome" tour.[92] In May 2010, secondnameplaceholder made an appearance during the beginning of the season finale of the reality-show American Idol, in which he sang "School's Out".[93]With his daughter, and former band member Dick Wagner, secondnameplaceholder scored the music for the indie horror flick Silas Gore.[94]During 2010, secondnameplaceholder began working on a new album, dubbed Welcome 2 My Nightmare, a sequel to the original Welcome to My Nightmare.[95] In a Radio Metal interview, he said that "We'll put some of the original people on it and add some new people ... I'm very happy with working with Bob (Ezrin) again."[95]On December 15, 2010, it was announced secondnameplaceholder and his former band would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony took place March 14, 2011, where secondnameplaceholder was inducted by fellow horror-rocker Rob Zombie. Original members Bruce, secondnameplaceholder, Dunaway, and Smith all made brief acceptance speeches and performed "I'm Eighteen" and "School's Out" live together, with Steve Hunter filling in for the late Glen Buxton. firstnameplaceholder showed up for the event wearing a (presumably fake) blood-splattered shirt and had a live albino Burmese python wrapped around his neck.[96][97] secondnameplaceholder told Rolling Stone Magazine that he was "elated" by the news and that the nomination had been made for the original band, as "We all did go to the same high school together, and we were all on the track team, and it was pretty cool that guys that knew each other before the band ended up going that far".[98]On March 10, 2011, Jackson Browne, David Crosby, Graham Nash, secondnameplaceholder, Jennifer Warnes, and others performed at a benefit concert in Tucson, Arizona, benefiting The Fund for Civility, Respect and Understanding, a foundation that raises awareness about and provides medical prevention and treatment services to people with mental disorders.[99] In June 2011 secondnameplaceholder took his place in the Reasonably Priced Car at the BBC auto show Top Gear.[100]On June 9, 2011, secondnameplaceholder was awarded the Kerrang! Icon Award at Kerrang! magazine's annual awards show. secondnameplaceholder used the opportunity to hit out at the "anaemic" rock music that dominates the charts, and said he has no intention of retiring from the industry.[101]secondnameplaceholder supported Iron Maiden on their Maiden England World Tour from June to July 21, 2012,[102] and then headlined Bloodstock Open Air on Sunday August 12.[103] On September 16, 2012, secondnameplaceholder appeared at the Sunflower Jam charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, performing alongside Brian May lead guitarist of Queen, bass guitarist John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, drummer Ian Paice of Deep Purple, and Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson.[104]secondnameplaceholder cameos as himself in the 2012 Tim Burton adaptation of Dark Shadows that starred Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter. In the film, Depp's character Barnabas Collins, assumes his name to be that of a woman, describes firstnameplaceholder as the ugliest woman he has ever seen.[105]In 2013, secondnameplaceholder announced that he had finished recording a covers album, based on songs by his rock star drinking buddies in the 1970s who had since died from excess, and that it was scheduled for a spring 2014 release.[106] Later he announced that the album will likely be released in 2015.[107]On January 28, 2014, it was officially revealed that firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder would be the opening act for Mötley Crüe's final tour, which would span throughout 2014 and 2015. secondnameplaceholder was featured on the song "Savages" on Theory of a Deadman's new album.[108]secondnameplaceholder was the subject of Super Duper firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, a biographical documentary film by Canadian directors Sam Dunn, Scot McFadyen and Reginald Harkema.[109] The film won a Canadian Screen Award for Best Feature Length Documentary at the 3rd Canadian Screen Awards in 2015.[110] In October, secondnameplaceholder released the live album and video Raise the Dead: Live from Wacken, which was recorded at Germany's Wacken heavy metal festival the previous year.[111]In 2015, secondnameplaceholder premiered Hollywood Vampires, a supergroup featuring Johnny Depp and Joe Perry with a new studio album of rock covers, featuring many guest artists including Paul McCartney, and live dates at L.A.'s Roxy Theatre and at Brazil's Rock in Rio festival in September. In 2016, secondnameplaceholder made headlines again as he resumed his running gag of campaigning for the US presidency.[112] secondnameplaceholder featured as a co-headliner with Deep Purple and Edgar Winter for several tour dates from August to early September 2017.[113]secondnameplaceholder released the album Paranormal in July 2017. It featured contributions from drummer Larry Mullen of U2, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top on guitar and Roger Glover from Deep Purple on bass. Guitarists Tommy Denander and Tommy Henriksen contributed most of the guitars.[citation needed]On Easter Sunday, 2018, secondnameplaceholder performed as Herod in NBC's live performance of Andrew Lloyd Weber's Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert.[114] Reviews were positive, with The New York Times' critic Noel Murray praising "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's magnificently scenery-chewing performance" as a "startling moment of clarity,"[115] and Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times describing his performance as, "Weird? Yes, but also perfect in a campy, dramatic and evil "Billion Dollar Babies" kind of way. secondnameplaceholder's part was small but indelible."[116] secondnameplaceholder had previously recorded the song (though not performed it live) in 2000, with the 1996 London revival cast.[117]secondnameplaceholder released his twenty-first solo album, Detroit Stories, on February 26, 2021.[118] In May, he announced a fall tour to promote the album, supported by Ace Frehley, set to begin in September 2021.[119]

It was like all my Halloweens came at once!"[124] A 2014 article on firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in The Guardian mentioned Arthur Brown and his flaming helmet, "British rock always was more theatrical than its US counterpart. Often this involved destruction or macabre gimmickry", with secondnameplaceholder responding, "That's why most people thought we were British at first".[125]Evidence of secondnameplaceholder's eclectic tastes in classic and contemporary rock music can be seen in the track listings of his radio show; in addition, when he appeared on the BBC Radio 2 program Tracks of My Years in September 2007, he listed his favorite tracks of all time as being: "19th Nervous Breakdown" (1966) by the Rolling Stones; "Turning Japanese" (1980) by the Vapors; "My Sharona" (1979) by the Knack; "Beds Are Burning" (1987) by Midnight Oil; "My Generation" (1965) by the Who; "Welcome to the Jungle" (1987) by Guns N' Roses; "Rebel Rebel" (1974) by David Bowie; "Over Under Sideways Down" (1966) by the Yardbirds; "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" (2003) by Jet; and "A Hard Day's Night" (1964) by the Beatles,[126] and when he appeared on Desert Island Discs in 2010 he chose the songs "Happenings Ten Years Time Ago" by the Yardbirds; "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys; "I'm a Boy" by the Who; "Timer" by Laura Nyro; "21st Century Schizoid Man" by King Crimson; "Been Caught Stealing" by Jane's Addiction; "Work Song" by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and "Ballad of a Thin Man" by Bob Dylan.[127]Rob Zombie, former front man of White Zombie, claims his first "metal moment" was seeing firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert.[128][129] Zombie has also claimed to have been heavily influenced by secondnameplaceholder's costumes.[20] In a 1978 interview with Rolling Stone, Bob Dylan stated, "I think firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is an overlooked songwriter".[130]In the foreword to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's CD retrospective box set The Life and Crimes of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, John Lydon of the Sex Pistols pronounced Killer as the greatest rock album of all time, and in 2002 Lydon presented his own tribute program to secondnameplaceholder on BBC radio.

The fact is, if you can call what I have a musical career, it all started with me miming to 'I'm Eighteen' on a jukebox".[131]The Flaming Lips are longtime firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder fans and used the bass line from "Levity Ball" (an early song from the 1969 release Pretties for You) for their song "The Ceiling Is Bending".

(secondnameplaceholder's version, which closes the album Love It to Death, was itself a cover of a Rolf Harris song.[132])In 1999, Cleopatra Records released Humanary Stew: A Tribute to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder featuring a number of contributions from rock and metal all-star collaborations, including Dave Mustaine, Roger Daltrey, Ronnie James Dio, Slash, Bruce Dickinson and Steve Jones.

<h2>Personal life</h2>
In the early 1970s, a story was widely reported that Leave It to Beaver star Ken Osmond had become "rock star firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder". According to secondnameplaceholder, the rumor began when a college newspaper editor asked him what kind of child he was, to which secondnameplaceholder replied, "I was obnoxious, disgusting, a real Eddie Haskell," referring to the fictional character Osmond portrayed. However, the editor ended up reporting that secondnameplaceholder was the real Haskell. secondnameplaceholder later told the New Times, "It was the biggest rumor that ever came out about me. Finally, I got a T-shirt that said, 'No, I am not Eddie Haskell.' But people still believed it."[138]On June 20, 2005, ahead of his June–July 2005 tour, secondnameplaceholder had a wide-ranging interview with interviewer of celebrities Andrew Denton for the Australian ABC Television's Enough Rope. secondnameplaceholder discussed various issues during the talk, including the horrors of acute alcoholism and his subsequent cure, being a Christian, and his social and work relationship with his family.[136] During the interview, secondnameplaceholder remarked "I look at Mick Jagger and he's on an 18-month tour and he's six years older than me, so I figure, when he retires, I have six more years. I will not let him beat me when it comes to longevity."[136]secondnameplaceholder frequently refers to himself in the third person as "firstnameplaceholder" as a way to distance himself from his stage persona.[139]In the period when the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder group was signed to Frank Zappa's Straight label, Miss Christine of The GTOs became secondnameplaceholder's girlfriend. Miss Christine (real name Christine Frka), who had recommended Zappa to the group, died on November 5, 1972, of an overdose.[fn 9] Another long-time girlfriend of secondnameplaceholder's was Cindy Lang (1949-2017[140]), with whom he lived for several years.After his separation from Lang, secondnameplaceholder was briefly linked with actress Raquel Welch.[139] secondnameplaceholder then reportedly left Welch, however, to marry ballerina instructor and choreographer Sheryl Goddard, who performed in the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder show from 1975 to 1982. They married on March 20, 1976.

In the same interview, he also said that the secret to a lasting and successful relationship is to continue going out on dates with one's partner.[143]In a 2019 interview, secondnameplaceholder said that he and his wife Sheryl have a death pact, wherein they will die at the same time, sparking a flurry of headlines.[144] But secondnameplaceholder clarified his comments telling USA Today, "What I was meaning was that because we're almost always together, at home and on the road, that if something did happen to either of us, we'd most likely be together at the time. But neither of us has a suicide pact. We have a life pact."[145]In 1986, Megadeth opened for secondnameplaceholder on their US Constrictor tour. After noticing the abuse of alcohol and other drugs in the band, secondnameplaceholder personally approached the band members to try to help them control their abuse, and he has stayed close to front man Dave Mustaine, who considers secondnameplaceholder to be his "godfather".[146] Since overcoming his own addiction to alcohol in the mid-1980s, secondnameplaceholder has continued to help and counsel other rock musicians with addiction problems. "I've made myself very available to friends of mine – they're people who would call me late at night and say, 'Between you and me, I've got a problem.'" In recognition of the work he has done in helping other addicts in the recovery process, secondnameplaceholder received in 2008 the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award at the fourth annual MusiCares MAP Fund benefit concert in Los Angeles.[147]During an interview with Johnnie Walker on BBC Radio 2 in September 2007, firstnameplaceholder said that he was not a Christian when he gave up drinking, but stated that he thanks God for "taking it away", saying, "I mean if He [God] can part the Red Sea and create the universe, He can certainly take alcoholism away from somebody."[148] Although he originally did not speak publicly about his religious beliefs, secondnameplaceholder was later vocal about his faith as a born-again Christian.[149][150]Throughout his career, secondnameplaceholder's philosophy regarding politics is that politics should not be mixed with rock music. secondnameplaceholder has usually kept his political views to himself, and in 2010 said, "I am extremely non-political. I go out of my way to be non-political. I'm probably the biggest moderate you know. When John Lennon and Harry Nilsson used to argue politics, I was sitting right in the middle of them, and I was the guy who was going 'I don't care.' When my parents would start talking politics, I would go in my room and put on the Rolling Stones or the Who as long as I could avoid politics. And I still feel that way."[98]On occasion he has spoken out against musicians who promote or opine on politics; for example, in the build-up to the 2004 presidential election, he told the Canadian Press that the rock stars campaigning for and touring on behalf of Democratic candidate John Kerry were committing "treason against rock n' roll". He added, upon seeing a list of musicians who supported Kerry, "If I wasn't already a Bush supporter, I would have immediately switched. Linda Ronstadt? Don Henley? Geez, that's a good reason right there to vote for Bush."[151][fn 10] In December 2018, secondnameplaceholder predicted that the next U.S. president would be "worse" than former president Donald Trump, while arguing that musicians talking politics to their fans was an "abuse of power".[152]Every four years since releasing his single "Elected" in 1972, secondnameplaceholder has satirically run for president.[112]secondnameplaceholder is a fan of the NHL's Arizona Coyotes.[153] On February 18, 2012, the Coyotes gave away his bobblehead in a promotion for the first 10,000 fans for a game with the Dallas Stars.[154] secondnameplaceholder is a longtime baseball fan, supporting the Arizona Diamondbacks and Detroit Tigers. As a child, he dreamed of playing left field in the Tigers outfield alongside Tigers Hall of Famer Al Kaline. He has coached Little League baseball teams since his son played in the early 1990s.[155] secondnameplaceholder is also a fan of NBA basketball, supporting the Detroit Pistons.[156]secondnameplaceholder is an avid golfer and says that the sport helped him play a major role in overcoming his addiction to alcohol,[157] and has even gone so far as to say that when he took up golf, it was a case of replacing one addiction with another.[158][159] The importance that the game has had in his life is also reflected in the title to his 2007 autobiography, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, Golf Monster.[160] secondnameplaceholder, who has participated in a number of Pro-Am competitions,[fn 11] plays the game six days a week, off a handicap of four.[21]secondnameplaceholder has also appeared in commercials for Callaway Golf equipment and was a guest of veteran British player and broadcaster Peter Alliss on A Golfer's Travels.[161] He wrote the foreword to the Gary McCord book Ryder Cup and participated in the second All*Star Cup in Newport, Wales.[162]secondnameplaceholder, a fan of The Simpsons, was asked to contribute a storyline for the September 2004 edition of Bongo Comics's Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror, a special Monsters of Rock issue that also included stories plotted by Gene Simmons, Rob Zombie and Pat Boone.[163]In October 1979, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was featured in the Marvel comic book Marvel Premiere, Volume 1, Number 50 loosely adapting his From the Inside album.[164][165]secondnameplaceholder is also the subject of the "we're not worthy" meme, which originates from his cameo in Wayne's World with Mike Myers and Dana Carvey in 1992.[166]secondnameplaceholder contributed his likeness and over 700 voice lines to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's Nightmare Castle, a pinball machine released in 2018 by Spooky Pinball that also features ten songs performed by secondnameplaceholder. Only 500 machines were made.[167]

<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder Maria secondnameplaceholder[7] was born in Decatur, Illinois,[8][9][a] to Fred and Louise secondnameplaceholder. Her father was a German immigrant who came to the United States in 1952 at age 12, and taught his native language while he earned a doctorate in psychology. He later went into the business of real estate. Her mother, an American of German and Italian descent, is the daughter of artists, and works as an illustrator of magazines and textbooks.[10] Fred and Louise met while they were studying at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.[11] After a brief residence in nearby Decatur, the family settled in Champaign, where secondnameplaceholder was raised with her older brother, Viktor.[12]secondnameplaceholder's mother played banjo and acoustic guitar,[10] so secondnameplaceholder was exposed to folk music at home, and she heard rock and pop music on the radio: she liked Gary Numan's synth-pop song "Cars", and rock bands such as Foreigner, Bad Company and Electric Light Orchestra.[13] Her brother Viktor played  piano and double bass in high school, launching a career as a jazz and rock multi-instrumentalist.[14] At her mother's insistence, secondnameplaceholder began studying classical violin at age five.[15] secondnameplaceholder was reluctant to spend time practicing, but she continued with classical lessons until she was eleven.[16] secondnameplaceholder said her mother "tried to find interesting things for me to do" and "wanted to get me involved in music, in addition to art and sports".[17] secondnameplaceholder was also very active in roller skating, and in her teens she finally decided on a career in music rather than roller derby.[15][18]In mid-1979, secondnameplaceholder's mother saw a notice for an upcoming fiddle competition at the Champaign County Fair, so she bought a bluegrass fiddle instruction book and the 1977 bluegrass album Duets by violinist Richard Greene. secondnameplaceholder learned by ear to play several songs from the album, including "Tennessee Waltz" which she practiced on violin with her mother accompanying on guitar. secondnameplaceholder entered the talent contest in the novice category at the age of eight, placing fourth.[19] (This is where she first met fiddler Andrea Zonn who won the junior division at age 10.[20]) secondnameplaceholder investigated the bluegrass genre more thoroughly after this, and she developed a knack for learning complex riffs by ear, quickly turning them into her own version.[10] In 1981–82, secondnameplaceholder performed with Marvin Lee Flessner's country dance band in which she fiddled and sang. In September 1983, her parents bought her a custom violin made by hand in Missouri – her first adult-sized instrument.[16] At 13, she won the Walnut Valley Festival Fiddle Championship,[21] and the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass in America named her the "Most Promising Fiddler in the Midwest".[22] She was also called "virtuoso" by Vanity Fair magazine.[23]secondnameplaceholder first met Dan Tyminski around 1984 at a festival held by the Society. Every current member of her band, Union Station, first met her at these festivals.[24]

secondnameplaceholder made her recording debut in 1985 on the independent album, Different Strokes, featuring her brother Viktor secondnameplaceholder, Swamp Weiss and Jim Hoiles. From the age of 12 she performed with bassist and songwriter John Pennell in a band called "Silver Rail", replacing Andrea Zonn.[25] Pennell later changed the band's name to Union Station after another band was discovered with the name Silver Rail.[26]Later that year, she signed to Rounder Records, and in 1987, at 16, she released her debut album Too Late to Cry with Union Station as her backup band.[27]secondnameplaceholder' debut solo album was quickly followed by her first group album with Union Station in 1989, Two Highways.[28] The album includes the traditional tunes "Wild Bill Jones" and "Beaumont Rag", along with a bluegrass interpretation of the Allman Brothers' "Midnight Rider".secondnameplaceholder' contract with Rounder required her to alternate between releasing a solo album and an album with Union Station,[29] and she released the solo album I've Got That Old Feeling in 1990. It was her first album to rise onto the Billboard charts, peaking in the top seventy-five on the country chart. The album also was a notable point in her career as she earned her first Grammy Award, the single "Steel Rails" was her first single tracked by Billboard, and the title single "I've Got That Old Feeling" was the first song for which she recorded a music video.

Also in 2002 she played a singing voice for one of the characters in Eight Crazy Nights.Lonely Runs Both Ways was released in 2004, and eventually became another firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder & Union Station gold certified album. Ron Block described Lonely Runs Both Ways as "pretty much... what we've always done" in terms of song selection and the style, in which those songs were recorded.[41] secondnameplaceholder believes the group "was probably the most unprepared we've ever been" for the album and that songs were chosen as needed rather than planned beforehand.[17] She also performed a duet with Brad Paisley on his album Mud on the Tires in the single "Whiskey Lullaby". The single was quickly ranked in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top five of the Hot Country Songs, and won the Country Music Association Awards for "Best Musical Event" and "Best Music Video" of the year.In 2007, secondnameplaceholder and Robert Plant released the collaborative album titled Raising Sand.

She and Dan Tyminski contributed multiple tracks, including "I'll Fly Away" (with Gillian Welch), "Down to the River to Pray", and "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow". In the film, Tyminski's vocals on "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow" were used for George Clooney's character.[51] The soundtrack sold over seven million copies and won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2002.[52] Both secondnameplaceholder and the surprisingly popular album were credited[53] with reviving interest in bluegrass. She has said, however, that she believes Americans already liked bluegrass and other less-heard musical genres, and that the film merely provided easy exposure to the music.[54] She did not appear in the movie, at her own request, because she was pregnant during its filming.[55]In 2007, secondnameplaceholder released A Hundred Miles or More: A Collection, an album of new songs, soundtrack tunes, and duets with artists such as John Waite, James Taylor, Brad Paisley, and Natalie MacMaster.[56] The album was  successful commercially but given a lukewarm reception by critics.[57] One of the tracks, "Missing You", a duet with Waite (and a cover of his hit single from 1984), was similarly received as a single. On August 11, television network Great American Country aired a one-hour special, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: A Hundred Miles or More, based on the album.[58]secondnameplaceholder appeared on Heart's March 2010 concert DVD Night at Sky Church, providing the lead vocals for the song "These Dreams".[59]Other soundtracks for which secondnameplaceholder has performed include Twister, The Prince of Egypt, Eight Crazy Nights, Mona Lisa Smile, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, Alias, Bambi II and Cold Mountain.

<h2>Reception and influences</h2>
secondnameplaceholder' earliest musical experience was as an instrumentalist, though her style has grown to focus more on her vocals[28] with a band providing most of the instrumentation. Musicians she enjoys include vocalists Lou Gramm of Foreigner and Paul Rodgers of Bad Company.[64][65][66] secondnameplaceholder' family listened to "folk records" while she was growing up, but she had friends who exposed her to groups such as AC/DC, Carly Simon, the Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and ELO.[67] She cites Dolly Parton, with whom she has since collaborated a number of times, as a major influence. Some credit secondnameplaceholder and Union Station, at least partially, with a recent revival of interest in bluegrass music in the United States.[53] Despite being together for nearly two decades and winning numerous awards, she said the group was "just beginning right now" (in 2002) because "in spite of all the great things that have happened for the band, [she] feel[s] musically it's just really beginning".[54] Although she alternates between solo releases and works with the band, she has said there is no difference in her involvement between the two.[55]As a group, AKUS have been called "American favourites", "world-beaters",[68] and "the tightest band around".[69] While they have been successful as a group, many reviews note secondnameplaceholder still "remains the undisputed star and rock-solid foundation" and have described her as the "band's focus"[70] with an "angelic"[69] voice that "flows like honey".[70] Her work has been compared to that of the Cox Family, Bill Monroe, and Del McCoury,[citation needed] and has in turn been credited with influencing various "Newgrass" artists including Nickel Creek, for which she acted as record producer on two of their albums.[71] In addition to her work with Nickel Creek, she has acted as producer to the Cox Family, Reba McEntire and Alan Jackson.[72] Adam Sweeting of The Guardian has said secondnameplaceholder and Union Station are "superb, when they stick to hoedowns and hillbilly music, but much less convincing, when they lurch towards the middle of the road".[73] and Blender magazine has said the "flavorless repertoire [secondnameplaceholder] sings... steers her toward Lite FM".[74] In addition, Q magazine and The Onion AV Club have said their newer releases are "pretty much the usual", and that although secondnameplaceholder is generally "adventurous", these recent releases contain nothing to "alienate the masses".[75]secondnameplaceholder possesses a soprano voice, which has been described as "angelic".[69][76]She has said her musical influences include J. D. Crowe, Ricky Skaggs, and Tony Rice.[77] Many of her songs are described as sad,[78] and are often about love, especially lost love. Though secondnameplaceholder has a close involvement with her group and a long career in music, she rarely performs music she has written herself. She has also described her general approach to constructing an album as starting with a single song and selecting other tracks based on the first, to give the final album a somewhat consistent theme and mood.[55][79] She most commonly performs in the bluegrass and country genres, though she has had two songs on the adult contemporary charts, has worked with rock artists such as Phish[28] and Sting,[60] and is sometimes said to stray into pop music.[25][80]secondnameplaceholder did not think she would make music videos at the beginning of her career. After recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has continued to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists. Dan Tyminski has noted that the video for Thriller was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions to the director of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos that band members have enjoyed. The director for a video to "If I Didn't Know Any Better" from Lonely Runs Both Ways, for example, was selected because secondnameplaceholder enjoyed work he had done with Def Leppard and, she wondered, what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many – including for "The Lucky One", "Restless", "Goodbye is All We Have", "New Favorite", and "If I Didn't Know Any Better" – follow a pattern. In all of these videos secondnameplaceholder walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.[24][81]secondnameplaceholder has said she used to dislike working in the studio, where she had to perform the same song repeatedly, but has come to like studio work roughly the same as live stage performances. Her own favorite concert experiences include watching three Foreigner concerts during a single tour, a Dolly Parton concert, and a Larry Sparks concert.[82]She appeared on Austin City Limits in 1992 and opened the show in 1995 with Union Station.[83] The New Favorite tour, after AKUS' album of the same name, was planned to start September 12, 2001 in Cincinnati, Ohio, but was delayed until September 28 in Savannah, Georgia following the September 11 terrorist attacks.[84] secondnameplaceholder took part in the Down from the Mountain tour in 2002, which featured many artists from the O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack.[85][86] Down from the Mountain was followed by the Great High Mountain Tour, which was composed of musicians from both O Brother and Cold Mountain, including secondnameplaceholder.[81] She has also given several notable smaller performances including at Carnegie Hall (with the Grand Ole Opry),[87] on Lifetime Television in a concert of female performers, on the radio show A Prairie Home Companion,[88] where she sang two songs not previously recorded on any of her albums, and a performance at the White House attended by then-President Bill Clinton and then-Vice President Al Gore.[89] She has also been in the White House again, performing the song "When You Say Nothing at All"[90] at country music performances. She also performed a tribute to the Everly Brothers at which she sang "All I Have to Do is Dream" with Emmylou Harris and "When Will I Be Loved" with Vince Gill.[91][92] She was also invited by Taylor Swift to perform with her at the 2013 CMA's and by Joshua Bell to perform with him on a Christmas album; Bell said that "she (secondnameplaceholder) is someone I've adored for so many years now".[93] She performed in Northwest, Washington, D.C. on January 10, 2015, as a part of "The Life and Songs of Emmylou Harris: An All Star Concert Celebration" which is a tribute to Emmylou Harris.[94][95]
<h2>Awards and honors</h2>
secondnameplaceholder has won twenty-seven Grammy Awards[96] over the course of her career as a solo artist, as a group with Union Station, as a duet with Robert Plant, and as a record producer. As of 2021, she ranks fourth on the list of winners of the most Grammy Awards.[97] She overtook Aretha Franklin for the most female wins at the 46th Grammy Awards, where secondnameplaceholder won three, bringing her total at the time to seventeen (Franklin won her sixteenth that night).[98] The Recording Academy (which presents the Grammy Awards) presented her with a special musical achievement honor in 2005.[99] She has also won 14 International Bluegrass Music Association Awards,[100] 9 Country Music Association Awards,[101][102] 2 Gospel Music Association Awards, 2 CMT Music Awards,[103][104][105] 2 Academy of Country Music Awards,[106] and 1 Canadian Country Music Award.[107] Country Music Television ranked secondnameplaceholder 12th on their "40 Greatest Women of Country Music" list in 2002.[108]At the 76th Academy Awards in February 2004, where she performed two nominated songs from the Cold Mountain soundtrack, secondnameplaceholder was chosen by Hollywood shoe designer Stuart Weitzman to wear a pair of $2 million 'Cinderella' sandals with 4½ inch clear glass stiletto heels and two straps adorned with 565 Kwiat diamonds set in platinum. Feeling like a rather unglamorous choice, secondnameplaceholder said, "When I first heard, I was like, 'What were they thinking?' I have the worst feet of anybody, who will be there that night!" In addition to the fairy-tale-inspired shoes, Weitzman outfitted secondnameplaceholder with a Palm Trēo 600 smartphone, bejeweled with 3,000 clear-and-topaz-colored Swarovski crystals. The shoes were returned, but secondnameplaceholder kept the crystal-covered phone. Weitzman chose secondnameplaceholder to show off his fashions at the urging of his daughters, who are fans of secondnameplaceholder' music.[109][110]In May 2012, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.[111]In March 2015, her hometown of Champaign, Illinois, designated the 400 block of West Hill Street as "Honorary firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Way".[112][113]

She also formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers. secondnameplaceholder's debut album, Frank, was released in 2003. Many of the album's songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, were co-written by secondnameplaceholder. Frank was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The song "Stronger Than Me" won her the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.secondnameplaceholder released her follow-up album, Back to Black, in 2006, which went on to become an international success and one of the best-selling albums in UK history.[1] At the 2007 Brit Awards it was nominated for British Album of the Year, and she received the award for British Female Solo Artist.

She died of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011, at the age of 27. After her death, Back to Black temporarily became the UK's best-selling album of the 21st century.[2] VH1 ranked secondnameplaceholder 26th on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born on 14 September 1983 at Chase Farm Hospital in Gordon Hill, Enfield, to Jewish parents.[3] Her father, Mitchell "Mitch" secondnameplaceholder, was a window panel installer[4] and taxi driver; her mother, Janis secondnameplaceholder (née Seaton),[5] was a pharmacist.[6] secondnameplaceholder's ancestors were Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish immigrants to London. firstnameplaceholder had an older brother, Alex (born 1979),[7] and the family lived in London's Southgate area,[3] where she attended Osidge Primary School.[8] secondnameplaceholder attended a Jewish Sunday school while she was a child.[9] During an interview following her rise to fame, she expressed her dismissal towards the school by saying that she used to beg her father to permit her not to go and that she learned nothing about being Jewish by going anyway.[10] In the same interview, secondnameplaceholder said she only went to a synagogue once a year on Yom Kippur "out of respect".[9]Many of secondnameplaceholder's maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians.[11] firstnameplaceholder's paternal grandmother, Cynthia, was a singer and dated the English jazz saxophonist Ronnie Scott.[12] She and firstnameplaceholder's parents influenced firstnameplaceholder's interest in jazz.[12] Her father, Mitch, often sang Frank Sinatra songs to her, and whenever she got chastised at school, she would sing "Fly Me to the Moon" before going up to the headmistress to be told off.[13] secondnameplaceholder's parents separated when she was nine,[14] and she lived with her mother and stayed with her father and his girlfriend in Hatfield Heath, Essex, on weekends.[15]In 1992, her grandmother Cynthia suggested that firstnameplaceholder attend the Susi Earnshaw Theatre School, where she went on Saturdays to further her vocal education and to learn to tap dance.[16][17] She attended the school for four years and founded a short-lived rap group called Sweet 'n' Sour, with Juliette Ashby, her childhood friend,[18] before seeking full-time training at Sylvia Young Theatre School. Several years later it was reported that secondnameplaceholder had been expelled at 14 for "not applying herself" and also for piercing her nose,[7][19] but these claims were denied by Sylvia Young: "She changed schools at 15...I've heard it said she was expelled; she wasn't. I'd never have expelled firstnameplaceholder."[20] Mitch secondnameplaceholder also denied the claims.[4] She attended the Mount School, Mill Hill and the BRIT School in Selhurst, Croydon.[21][22][23]
<h2>Career</h2>
After toying around with her brother Alex's guitar, secondnameplaceholder bought her own when she was 14 and began writing music shortly afterwards. Soon after she began working for a living, as an entertainment journalist for the World Entertainment News Network and also singing with local group the Bolsha Band.[7][24] In July 2000, she became the featured female vocalist with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. She was influenced by Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington,[25] the latter of whom she was already listening to at home.[12] secondnameplaceholder's best friend, soul singer Tyler James, sent her demo tape to an A&R person.[12] She signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was paid £250 a week against future earnings.[26]While being developed by the management company, secondnameplaceholder was kept as a recording industry secret,[27] although she was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club.[26] Her future A&R representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by accident when the manager of The Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured secondnameplaceholder as key vocalist. When he asked who the singer was, the manager told him he was not allowed to say. Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was. However, secondnameplaceholder had already recorded a number of songs and signed a publishing deal with EMI by this time. Incidentally, she formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers.[27]Beese introduced secondnameplaceholder to his boss, Nick Gatfield; the Island head shared his enthusiasm in signing the young artist. secondnameplaceholder was signed to Island, as rival interest in her had started to build with representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the excitement over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.[27]secondnameplaceholder's debut album, Frank, was released on 20 October 2003. Produced mainly by Salaam Remi, many songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, secondnameplaceholder co-wrote every song. The album received critical acclaim[28][29] with compliments given to the "cool, critical gaze" in its lyrics.[30] secondnameplaceholder's voice was compared with those of Sarah Vaughan and[31] Macy Gray, among others.[30]The album entered the upper reaches of the UK album chart in 2004 when it was nominated for the Brit Awards in the categories of "British Female Solo Artist" and "British Urban Act." It went on to achieve platinum sales.[32][33] Later in 2004, she and Remi won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song, for their first single together, "Stronger Than Me."[34] The album was also shortlisted for the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. In the same year, she performed at the Glastonbury Festival – Jazzworld, the V Festival and the Montreal International Jazz Festival. After the release of the album, secondnameplaceholder commented that she was "only 80 percent behind [the] album" because Island Records had overruled her preferences for the songs and mixes to be included.[12] The further singles from the album were "Take the Box," "In My Bed"/"You Sent Me Flying" and "Pumps"/"Help Yourself."After the release of her first jazz-influenced album, secondnameplaceholder's focus shifted to the girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. secondnameplaceholder hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up in the studio and on tour.[35] Mitch secondnameplaceholder relates in firstnameplaceholder, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music.[36] In May 2006, secondnameplaceholder's demo tracks such as "You Know I'm No Good" and "Rehab" appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of "Pumps" and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months,[36] was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with secondnameplaceholder because she was blunt when she did not like his work.[37] She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard.[38]Promotion of Back to Black soon began and, in early October 2006 secondnameplaceholder's official website was relaunched with a new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs.[32] Back to Black was released in the UK on 30 October 2006. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks in February. In the US, it entered at number seven on the Billboard 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007, selling 1.85 million copies over the course of the year.[39] The first single released from the album was the Ronson-produced "Rehab." The song reached the top ten in the UK and the US.[40][41] Time magazine named "Rehab" the Best Song of 2007. Writer Josh Tyrangiel praised secondnameplaceholder for her confidence, saying, "What she is is mouthy, funny, sultry, and quite possibly crazy" and "It's impossible not to be seduced by her originality. Combine it with production by Mark Ronson that references four decades worth of soul music without once ripping it off, and you've got the best song of 2007."[42] The album's second single and lead single in the US, "You Know I'm No Good," was released in January 2007 with a remix featuring rap vocals by Ghostface Killah. It ultimately reached number 18 on the UK singles chart. The title track, "Back to Black," was released in the UK in April 2007 and peaked at number 25, but was more successful across mainland Europe.[43] "Tears Dry on Their Own," "Love Is a Losing Game" were also released as singles, but failed to achieve the same level of success.A deluxe edition of Back to Black was also released on 5 November 2007 in the UK. The bonus disc features B-sides, rare, and live tracks, as well as "Valerie." secondnameplaceholder's debut DVD I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London was released the same day in the UK and 13 November in the US. It includes a live set recorded at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire and a 50-minute documentary charting the singer's career over the previous four years.[45] Frank was released in the United States on 20 November 2007 to positive reviews.[46][47] The album debuted at number 61 on the Billboard 200 chart.[48] In addition to her own album, she collaborated with other artists on singles. secondnameplaceholder was a vocalist on the song "Valerie" on Ronson's solo album Version. The song peaked at number two in the UK, upon its October single release. "Valerie" was nominated for a 2008 Brit Award for "Best British Single."[49][50][51] Her work with ex-Sugababe Mutya Buena, "B Boy Baby," was released on 17 December 2007. It served as the fourth single from Buena's debut album, Real Girl.[52] secondnameplaceholder was also in talks of working with Missy Elliott for her album Block Party.[53]secondnameplaceholder promoted the release of Back to Black with headline performances in late 2006, including a Little Noise Sessions charity concert at the Union Chapel in Islington, London.[54] On 31 December 2006, secondnameplaceholder appeared on Jools Holland's Annual Hootenanny and performed a cover of Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" along with Paul Weller and Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. She also performed Toots and the Maytals' "Monkey Man". At his request, actor Bruce Willis introduced secondnameplaceholder before her performance of "Rehab" at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards in Universal City, California, on 3 June 2007.[55] During the summer of 2007, she performed at various festivals, including Glastonbury Festival[56] and Lollapalooza in Chicago.[57]The rest of her tour, however, did not go as well. In November 2007, the opening night of a 17-date tour was marred by booing and walkouts at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. A critic for the Birmingham Mail said it was "one of the saddest nights of my life...I saw a supremely talented artist reduced to tears, stumbling around the stage and, unforgivably, swearing at the audience."[58] Other concerts ended similarly, with, for example, fans at her Hammersmith Apollo performance in London saying that she "looked highly intoxicated throughout,"[59] until she announced on 27 November 2007, that her performances and public appearances were cancelled for the remainder of the year, citing her doctor's advice to take a complete rest. A statement issued by concert promoter Live Nation blamed "the rigours involved in touring and the intense emotional strain that firstnameplaceholder has been under in recent weeks" for the decision.[60] Mitch secondnameplaceholder wrote about her nervousness before public performances in his 2012 book, firstnameplaceholder, My Daughter.[61] On 13 January 2008, Back to Black held the number-one position on the Billboard Pan European charts for the third consecutive week.[62]On 10 February 2008, secondnameplaceholder received five Grammy Awards, winning in the following categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the single "Rehab," and Best Pop Vocal Album.[63] The singer also earned a Grammy as Best New Artist, earning her an entry in the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of Records for Most Grammy Awards won by a British Female Act.[64] Additionally, Back to Black was nominated for Album of the Year.[65][66] Ronson's work with her won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, in the non-classical category.[67] She ended her acceptance speech for Record of the Year with, "This is for London because Camden town ain't burning down," in reference to the 2008 Camden Market fire.[68] Performing "You Know I'm No Good" and "Rehab" via satellite from London's Riverside Studios at 3 a.m. UK time, she couldn't be at the ceremony in Los Angeles as her visa approval had not been processed in time.[4]After the Grammys, the album's sales increased, catapulting Back to Black to number two on the US Billboard 200, after it initially peaked in the seventh position.[69] On 20 February 2008, secondnameplaceholder performed at the 2008 Brit Awards at Earls Court in London, performing "Valerie" with Mark Ronson, followed by "Love Is a Losing Game." She urged the crowd to "make some noise for my Blake."[70] A special deluxe edition of Back to Black topped the UK album charts on 2 March 2008. Meanwhile, the original edition of the album was ranked at number 30 in its 68th week on the charts, while Frank charted at number 35.[71]In Paris, she performed what was described as a "well-executed 40-minute" set at the opening of a Fendi boutique in early March.[72] By 12 March, the album had sold a total of 2,467,575 copies—318,350 copies had been sold in the previous 10 weeks—putting the album on the UK's top-10 best-selling albums of the 21st century for the first time.[73] On 7 April, Back to Black was in the top position of the pan-European charts for the sixth consecutive and thirteenth aggregate week.[74] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder – The Girl Done Good: A Documentary Review, a 78-minute DVD, was released on 14 April 2008. The documentary features interviews with those who knew her at a young age, people who helped her achieve success, jazz music experts, and music and pop-culture specialists.[75]At the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards in May, secondnameplaceholder became the first-ever artist to receive two nominations for the top award: Best Song Musically & Lyrically. She won the award for "Love Is a Losing Game" and was nominated for "You Know I'm No Good."[76] "Rehab," a Novello winner for best contemporary song in 2006, also received a 2008 nomination for best-selling British song.[77] secondnameplaceholder was also nominated for a 2008 MTV Europe Award in the "Act of the Year" category.[78]Although her father, manager and various members of her touring team reportedly tried to dissuade her, secondnameplaceholder performed at the Rock in Rio Lisboa festival in Portugal in May 2008.[16] Although the set was plagued by a late arrival and problems with her voice, the crowd warmed to her. In addition to her own material she performed two Specials covers.[79] secondnameplaceholder performed at Nelson Mandela's 90th Birthday Party concert at London's Hyde Park on 27 June 2008,[80] and the next day at the Glastonbury Festival.[81] On 12 July, at the Oxegen Festival in Ireland she performed a well-received 50-minute set[82] which was followed the next day by a 14-song set at T in the Park.[83]On 16 August she played at the Staffordshire leg of the V Festival, and the following day played the Chelmsford leg of the festival. Organisers said that secondnameplaceholder attracted the biggest crowds of the festival. Audience reaction was reported as mixed.[84] On 6 September, she was Bestival's Saturday headliner, where her performance was described as polished—terminated by a curfew as the show running overdue, after secondnameplaceholder started an hour late—and her storming off stage.[85]A clip of secondnameplaceholder's music was included in the "Roots and Influences" area that looked at connections between different artists at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex NYC, which opened in December 2008. One thread started with Billie Holiday, continued with Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige, and then finished with secondnameplaceholder.[86]Back to Black was the world's seventh-biggest-selling album of 2008.[87] The album's sales meant that the market performance of Universal Music's recorded music division did not drop to levels experienced by the overall music market.[88]In a 2009 poll of U.S. residents conducted for VisitBritain by Harris Interactive, one-fifth of the participants indicated they had listened to secondnameplaceholder's music during the previous year.[89] She performed with Rhythms del Mundo on their cover of the Sam Cooke song, "Cupid", for an Artists Project Earth benefit album released in July that year.[90][91]secondnameplaceholder and Ronson contributed a cover of Lesley Gore's "It's My Party" to the Quincy Jones tribute album Q Soul Bossa Nostra, released in November 2010.[92] She had agreed to form a group with Questlove of the Roots but her problems obtaining a visa delayed their working together. Salaam Remi had already created some material with secondnameplaceholder as part of the project.[93] According to The Times, Universal Music pressed her for new material in 2008, but as of 2 September that year she had not been near a recording studio.[88] In late October, secondnameplaceholder's spokesman was quoted as saying that secondnameplaceholder had not been given a deadline to complete her third album, for which she was learning to play drums.[94]In May 2009, secondnameplaceholder returned to performing at a jazz festival in St. Lucia amid torrential downpours and technical difficulties. During her set, it was reported she was unsteady on her feet and had trouble remembering lyrics. She apologised to the crowd for being "bored" and ended the set in the middle of a song.[95][96] During her stay in St. Lucia, however, she worked on new music with Remi. On 23 August that year secondnameplaceholder sang with the Specials at the V Festival, on their songs "You're Wondering Now" and "Ghost Town".[97]Island claimed that a new album would be due for release in 2010. Island co-president Darcus Beese said, "I've heard a couple of song demos that have absolutely floored me."[98] In July 2010, secondnameplaceholder was quoted as saying her next album would be released no later than January 2011, saying "It's going to be very much the same as my second album, where there's a lot of jukebox stuff and songs that are... just jukebox, really." Ronson, however, said at that time that he had not started to record the album.[99] She performed "Valerie" with Ronson at a movie premiere but forgot some of the song's lyrics.[99] In October, secondnameplaceholder performed a four-song set to promote her fashion line. In December 2010, she played a 40-minute concert at a Russian oligarch's party in Moscow, with the tycoon hand-selecting the songs.[100]In January 2011, secondnameplaceholder played five dates in Brazil, with opening acts of Janelle Monáe and Mayer Hawthorne.[101][102] The following month she cut short a performance in Dubai following booing from the audience. secondnameplaceholder was reported to be tired, distracted and "tipsy" during the performance.[103]On 18 June 2011, secondnameplaceholder started her twelve-leg European tour in Belgrade.

It was reported that she was unable to remember the city she was in, the lyrics of her songs or the names of the members of her band.[104][105] The local press also claimed that secondnameplaceholder was forced to perform by her bodyguards, who did not allow her to leave the stage when she tried to do so.[106] She then pulled out of performances in Istanbul and Athens, which had been scheduled for the following week.[107] On 21 June, it was announced that she had cancelled all shows of her tour and would be given "as long as it takes" to sort herself out.[108]secondnameplaceholder's last public appearance took place at Camden's Roundhouse on 20 July 2011, when she made a surprise appearance on stage to support her goddaughter, Dionne Bromfield, who was singing "Mama Said" with the Wanted.[109] secondnameplaceholder died three days later.

secondnameplaceholder was known for her deep, expressive contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul,[136][137][138] (sometimes labelled as blue-eyed soul and neo soul),[139][140] rhythm and blues,[141][142][143] and jazz.[30][144] The BBC's Garry Mulholland called secondnameplaceholder "the pre-eminent vocal talent of her generation".[145] According to AllMusic's Cyril Cordor, she was one of the UK's premier singers during the 2000s; "fans and critics alike embraced her rugged charm, brash sense of humor, and distinctively soulful and jazzy vocals".[11] In The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan later wrote that "her idolisation of Dinah Washington and the Ronettes distinguished her from almost all newly minted pop singers of the early 2000s; her exceptionally-susceptible-to-heartbreak voice did the rest".[146] Soon after secondnameplaceholder's death, a number of prominent critics assessed the singer's legacy: Maura Johnston from The Village Voice said, "When she was on, secondnameplaceholder had few peers—she wasn't an octave-jumper like other big divas of the moment, but her contralto had a snap to it that enriched even the simplest syllables with a full spectrum of emotion"; Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker proclaimed, "Nobody can match secondnameplaceholder's unique transitions or her utterly weird phrasings. She sounded like an original sixties soul star, developed when the landscape had no rules. But now untrammeled traditionalism is in the lead and her beautiful footnote has been cut short. American soul—through visionaries like Erykah Badu and Janelle Monae and Jill Scott—had moved on. But secondnameplaceholder was a fine shepherd of the past."[147]By contrast, Robert Christgau dismissed secondnameplaceholder as "a self-aggrandizing self-abuser who's taken seriously because she makes a show of soul". In his opinion, the singer "simulated gravitas by running her suicidal tendencies through an amalgam of 20th-century African-American vocal stylings—the slides, growls, and melismatic outcries that for many matures are now the only reliable signifiers of pop substance".[148]On 13 February 2012, secondnameplaceholder was ranked 26th on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music list.[149] In March 2017, singer-songwriter Bob Dylan said he was enjoying listening to secondnameplaceholder's last record (Back to Black), and called her "the last real individualist around."[150]
<h2>Image</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's greatest love was 1960s girl groups.[151] Her hairdresser, Alex Foden, borrowed her "instantly recognisable" beehive hairdo (a weave[152][153]) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from the Ronettes.[151] Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: "Ronnie Spector—who, it could be argued, all but invented secondnameplaceholder's style in the first place when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of secondnameplaceholder in the New York Post that she exclaimed, "I don't know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But then I found out, no, it's firstnameplaceholder! I didn't have on my glasses."[154]The New York Times style reporter, Guy Trebay, discussed the multiplicity of influences on secondnameplaceholder's style after her death. Trebay noted, "her stylish husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, may have influenced her look." Additionally, Trebay observed:Former Rolling Stone editor Joe Levy, who had put her on the magazine's cover, broke her look down this way:secondnameplaceholder's use of bold red lipstick, thick eyebrows and heavy eyeliner came from Latinas she saw in Miami, on her trip there to work with Salaam Remi on Back to Black.[156] Her look was repeatedly denigrated by the British press. At the same time that the NME Awards nominated secondnameplaceholder in the categories of "Best Solo Artist" and "Best Music DVD" in 2008, they awarded her "Worst Dressed Performer."[157][158] secondnameplaceholder was also ranked number two on Richard Blackwell's 48th annual "Ten Worst Dressed Women" list, behind Victoria Beckham.[159]
<h2>Criticism</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's dichotomous public image of critical and commercial success versus personal turmoil prompted significant media comment. The New Statesman called secondnameplaceholder "a filthy-mouthed, down-to-earth diva",[160] while Newsweek called her "a perfect storm of sex kitten, raw talent and poor impulse control".[161] Karen Heller with The Philadelphia Inquirer summarised the maelstrom this way:By 2008, her drug problems threatened her career. As Nick Gatfield, the president of Island Records, toyed with the idea of releasing secondnameplaceholder "to deal with her problems", he said, "It's a reflection of her status [in the US] that when you flick through the TV coverage [of the Grammys] it's her image they use."[163] Post-Grammys, some questioned whether secondnameplaceholder should have been honoured with the awards given her recent personal and drug problems, including Natalie Cole, who introduced secondnameplaceholder at the ceremony and who herself battled substance-abuse problems while winning a Grammy for Best New Artist in 1975.[164][165][166][167] (secondnameplaceholder was prevented from travelling to and performing at the Grammy Awards ceremony in the US due to failing a drug test.[61]) In a newspaper commentary, the executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa, said that the alleged drug habits of secondnameplaceholder and other celebrities sent a bad message "to others who are vulnerable to addiction" and undermine the efforts of other celebrities trying to raise awareness of problems in Africa, now that more cocaine used in Europe passes through that continent.[168] secondnameplaceholder's spokesperson noted that "firstnameplaceholder has never given a quote about drugs or flaunted it in any way. She's had some problems and is trying to get better. The U.N. should get its own house in order."[169]In January 2008, her record label stated it believed the extensive media coverage she had received increased record sales.[170] In an April 2008 poll conducted by Sky News, secondnameplaceholder was named the second greatest "ultimate heroine" by the UK population at large, topping the voting for that category of those polled under 25 years old.[171] Psychologist Donna Dawson commented that the results demonstrated that women like secondnameplaceholder who had "a certain sense of vulnerability or have had to fight against some adversity in their lives" received recognition.[171]In July 2008, BBC Radio Scotland's head, Jeff Zycinski, stated that the BBC, and media in general, were complicit in undermining celebrities, including secondnameplaceholder.[172] He said that public interest in the singer's lifestyle did not make her lifestyle newsworthy. Rod McKenzie, editor of the BBC Radio One programme Newsbeat, replied: "If you play [firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's] music to a certain demographic, those same people want to know what's happening in her private life. If you don't cover it, you're insulting young licence fee payers."[172] In The Scotsman, British singer and songwriter Lily Allen was quoted to have said – "I know firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder very well. And she is very different to what people portray her as being. Yes, she does get out of her mind on drugs sometimes, but she is also a very clever, intelligent, witty, funny person who can hold it together. You just don't see that side."[173]
<h2>Charity work</h2>
Throughout her life secondnameplaceholder donated her money, music and time to many charities, particularly those concerned with children. She was once named "the most charitable act" by Pop World. While this side of her personality was never well known to the general public, throughout both the arts community and the charity community she was known for her generosity.[174]In 2008, secondnameplaceholder appeared naked in an issue of Easy Living Magazine to raise awareness of breast cancer.[113][114] In 2009, she appeared on a CD called Classics alongside musicians such as the Rolling Stones, the Killers and many Cuban musicians to raise awareness of climate change. In March 2011, secondnameplaceholder donated over £20,000 worth of clothes to a local charity shop in London.[175][176]A Caribbean man Julian Jean DeBaptiste revealed that secondnameplaceholder had paid for his urgent surgery costing £4,000 during her stay in Saint Lucia in 2009. "I had surgery on 1 July 2009... it cost a fortune and firstnameplaceholder paid for the whole thing. I tried to thank her but she just hugged me and told me not to say anything. Her generosity gave me my life back."[177]
<h2>Legacy and honours</h2>
London's Mall Galleries opened an exhibition in May 2008 that included a sculpture of secondnameplaceholder, titled Excess. The piece, created by Guy Portelli, had a miniature of the singer lying on top of a cracked champagne bottle, with a pool of spilled liquid underneath. The body was covered with what appeared to be tiny pills, while one outstretched hand held a glass.[178] Another piece, a print titled Celebrity 1 by artist Charlotte Suckling, was shown in the same exhibition.[178]A wax sculpture of secondnameplaceholder went on display at the London Madame Tussauds on 23 July 2008. The singer did not attend the unveiling, although her parents did.[179] A sculpture by Marco Perego, titled The Only Good Rock Star Is a Dead Rock Star, that depicts secondnameplaceholder lying in a pool of blood with an apple and a bullet hole in her head after being shot by American novelist and Beat poet William S. Burroughs (in a recreation of the accidental killing of his wife Joan Vollmer),[180] was scheduled to go on display in New York's Half Gallery on 14 November 2008 with a sale price of US$100,000. Perego said of the sculpture: "Rock stars are the sacrificial animals of society." secondnameplaceholder's spokesperson stated: "It's a funny kind of tribute. The artist seems in thrall to a tabloid persona that is not the real firstnameplaceholder. People often use her image to sell their work."[180]In 2012, secondnameplaceholder was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.[181]On 14 September 2014 (which would have been secondnameplaceholder's 31st birthday), a statue was unveiled of her, which was created by sculptor Scott Eaton, at Stables Market in Camden Town, north London. Fans and relatives gathered for the unveiling in Camden's Stable Market, where it will be a permanent memorial to her.[182] London-based Eaton, who sculpted the piece after being introduced to secondnameplaceholder's father Mitch, said the statue was meant to capture her "attitude and strength, but also give subtle hints of insecurity."[182] Her father Mitch said of the statue: "Now firstnameplaceholder will oversee the comings and goings of her home town forever... firstnameplaceholder was in love with Camden and it is the place her fans from all over the world associate her with."[183]In March 2020, secondnameplaceholder's name on a stone was unveiled on the new Music Walk of Fame in Camden, with her parents Mitch and Janis in attendance at the ceremony.[184]Adele has credited secondnameplaceholder's success in making her and fellow British singer Duffy's journey to the United States "a bit smoother."[185] Lady Gaga credited secondnameplaceholder with paving the way for her rise to the top of the charts, explaining that secondnameplaceholder made it easier for unconventional women to have mainstream pop success.[186] Raphael Saadiq, Anthony Hamilton and John Legend said "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was produced by people who wanted to create a marketing coup. The positive side is that it reacquainted an audience with this music and played an introductory role for others. This reinvigorated the genre by overcoming the vintage aspect."[187]Other artists that have credited secondnameplaceholder as an influence and/or for paving the way for them include Bruno Mars,[188] Tove Lo,[189] Jessie J,[190] Emeli Sandé,[191] Victoria Justice,[192] Paloma Faith,[193] Lana Del Rey,[194] Sam Smith,[195] Florence Welch,[196] Halsey,[197] Alessia Cara,[198] Estelle,[199] Daya,[200] Jorja Smith,[201] Lauren Jauregui[202] and Billie Eilish.[203]After the release of Back to Black, record companies sought out female artists with a similar sound and fearless and experimental female musicians in general. Adele and Duffy were the second wave of artists with a sound similar to secondnameplaceholder's. A third wave of female musicians that has emerged since the album was released are led by V V Brown, Florence and the Machine, La Roux and Little Boots.[204] In March 2011, the New York Daily News ran an article attributing the continuing wave of British female artists that have been successful in the United States to secondnameplaceholder and her absence. Spin magazine music editor Charles Aaron was quoted as saying "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was the Nirvana moment for all these women," "They can all be traced back to her in terms of attitude, musical styles or fashion." According to Keith Caulfield, chart manager for Billboard, "Because of firstnameplaceholder, or the lack thereof, the marketplace was able to get singers like Adele, Estelle and Duffy," "Now those ladies have brought on the new ones, like Eliza Doolittle, Rumer and Ellie."[205]After the singer's death by alcohol intoxication in July 2011, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Foundation was set up by secondnameplaceholder's family and launched on 14 September 2011 (which would have been secondnameplaceholder's 28th birthday). Its aim is to help young people and it works with other charitable organisations to provide frontline support. Its central office is in North London, but it also has an office in New York (operating under the name 'The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Foundation US').[206] Both Jon Snow and Barbara Windsor are patrons for the charity, and ambassadors include Keira Chaplin and Mica Paris. In October 2015 Mark Ronson became a patron.[207] firstnameplaceholder's brother Alex works full-time for the foundation, having given up his career as an online music journalist.[8]The charity itself works to prevent the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on young people and it also aims to support, inform and inspire vulnerable and disadvantaged young people to help them reach their full potential.[208] On 12 March 2013, with the help of ex-addict Russell Brand, the Foundation launched the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Foundation Resilience Programme For Schools across the UK which aims to provide effective education around drugs, alcohol and dealing with emotional issues.[209]A documentary film, firstnameplaceholder (2015), directed by Asif Kapadia and produced by James Gay-Rees was released on 3 July 2015. The film covers secondnameplaceholder's life, her relationships, her struggles with substance abuse both before and after her career blossomed, and which eventually caused her death.[210] The film received its première at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival on 16 May and has been reviewed as "a tragic masterpiece", "brilliant", "heartbreaking" and "unmissable".[211] The soundtrack of the same name was released on 30 October 2015, along with the DVD that includes music featured in the documentary by film composer Antônio Pinto and classic and some unreleased tracks by secondnameplaceholder. The film was highly acclaimed and received various accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 2016 Oscars, Best Music Film at the 2016 Grammy Awards, the BAFTA for Best Documentary, the MTV Movie Award for Best Documentary, in addition to a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best British Film.[212][213]On 14 October 2018, it was announced that secondnameplaceholder's family had signed a deal with Monumental Pictures to make a biopic about her life, which will be directed by Alison Owen and produced by Debra Hayward. secondnameplaceholder's story will be adapted for the big screen by Geoff Deane, who has written comedy movies Kinky Boots (2005) and It's a Boy Girl Thing (2006).[214] The project was scheduled to start filming in early 2019 and the funds are allegedly going towards the foundation.[215]On 9 October 2017, it was announced by secondnameplaceholder's father Mitch that a West End/Broadway musical on firstnameplaceholder is in the works.[216][217] Mitch secondnameplaceholder revealed the news at the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Foundation Gala event in London.[216]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was raised Jewish and expressed pride in being Jewish, although she was not religious.[218] During one interview, secondnameplaceholder said "being Jewish to me is about being together as a real family. It's not about lighting candles and saying a bracha."[9] secondnameplaceholder also frequently performed with a large Star of David medallion.[9]In 2013, in memory of secondnameplaceholder the Jewish Museum London ran an exhibition titled "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: A Family Portrait".[9] The museum researched about her paternal great-great-grandfather's arrival from Minsk in 1890, and how the family finally settled in London, starting out in working-class jobs before gradually moving to middle-class jobs.[9]secondnameplaceholder had 14 known tattoos, including "Daddy's Girl" on her left arm for her father and a pin-up girl with the name "Cynthia" on her right arm in memory of her Jewish grandmother.[219]secondnameplaceholder dated chef-musician Alex Clare (sometimes referred to as Alex Claire) in 2006, while on a break from her on-off boyfriend and future husband, Blake Fielder-Civil. She and Clare lived together briefly,[220] and in a pattern that Fielder-Civil would later repeat, Clare sold his story to the News of the World, which published it under the headline "Bondage Crazed firstnameplaceholder Just Can't Beehive in Bed."[221][222][223]Fielder-Civil, a former video production assistant,[224] had dropped out of Bourne Grammar School and, aged 16, moved to London from his native Lincolnshire.[16] He married secondnameplaceholder on 18 May 2007, in Miami Beach, Florida.[224] In a June 2007 interview, secondnameplaceholder admitted she could sometimes be violent toward him after she had been drinking, saying: "If he says one thing I don't like, then I'll chin him."[225] In August 2007, they were photographed, bloodied and bruised, in the streets of London after an alleged fight, although she contended her injuries were self-inflicted.[226] secondnameplaceholder's parents and in-laws publicly reported their numerous concerns, the latter citing fears that the two might commit suicide. Fielder-Civil's father encouraged fans to boycott secondnameplaceholder's music, and Mitch secondnameplaceholder said this would not help.[227] Fielder-Civil was quoted in a British tabloid as saying he introduced secondnameplaceholder to crack cocaine and heroin.[228] During a visit with Mitch secondnameplaceholder at the prison in July 2008, Fielder-Civil reportedly said that he and secondnameplaceholder would cut themselves to ease the pain of withdrawal.[16]From 21 July 2008 to 25 February 2009, Fielder-Civil was imprisoned following his guilty plea on charges of trying to pervert the course of justice and of grievous bodily harm with intent.[229][230] The incident, in July 2007, involved his assault of a pub landlord that broke the victim's cheek.[231] According to the prosecution, the landlord accepted £200,000 as part of a deal to "effectively throw the [court] case and not turn up," and he testified that the money belonged to secondnameplaceholder,[232] but she pulled out of a meeting with the men involved in the plot, to attend an awards ceremony.[233] Mitch secondnameplaceholder, as manager of his daughter's money, has denied the payoff came from her.[61]When secondnameplaceholder was spotted with aspiring actor Josh Bowman on holiday in Saint Lucia, in early January 2009, she said she was "in love again, and I don't need drugs."[234] She commented that her "whole marriage was based on doing drugs" and that "for the time being I've just forgotten I'm even married."[234] On 12 January, secondnameplaceholder's spokesman confirmed that "papers have been received" for what Fielder-Civil's solicitor has said are divorce proceedings based on a claim of adultery.[235][236] In March, secondnameplaceholder was quoted in a magazine as saying, "I still love Blake and I want him to move into my new house with me—that was my plan all along ... I won't let him divorce me. He's the male version of me and we're perfect for each other."[237] Nonetheless, an uncontested divorce was granted on 16 July 2009 and became final on 28 August 2009.[238] Fielder-Civil received no money in the settlement.[4][239]She was in a relationship with a British writer and director of films, Reg Traviss, from early 2010 until she died.[240] According to media reports and a biography written by secondnameplaceholder's father, Traviss and secondnameplaceholder had planned to marry and intended to have children.[241]After secondnameplaceholder's death, Pete Doherty said that he and secondnameplaceholder had been lovers at one point. However, in July 2008, when Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked secondnameplaceholder about her relationship with Doherty, secondnameplaceholder replied: "We're just good friends", and added: "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he looked at me like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".[153]secondnameplaceholder's battles with substance abuse were the subject of much media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss.[4][16] People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black.[16] Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction.[16] In August 2007, secondnameplaceholder cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol.[242] In various interviews, she admitted to having problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.[7][132]secondnameplaceholder told a magazine that the drugs were to blame for her hospitalisation and that "I really thought that it was over for me then."[243] Soon afterward, secondnameplaceholder's father commented that when he had made public statements regarding her problems he was using the media because it seemed the only way to get through to her.[244] In an interview with The Album Chart Show on British television, secondnameplaceholder said she was manic depressive and not alcoholic, adding that that sounded like "an alcoholic in denial".[245] A US reporter writes that secondnameplaceholder was a "victim of mental illness in a society that doesn't understand or respond to mental illness with great effectiveness."[246]In December 2007, secondnameplaceholder's spokesman reported that the singer was in a physician-supervised programme and was channelling her difficulties by writing a lot of music.[247] The British tabloid The Sun posted a video of a woman, alleged to be secondnameplaceholder, apparently smoking crack cocaine and speaking of having taken ecstasy and valium. secondnameplaceholder's father moved in with her,[248] and Island Records, her record label, announced the abandonment of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf.[163] In late January 2008, secondnameplaceholder reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment program.[249]On 23 January 2008, the video was passed on to the Metropolitan Police,[163] who questioned her on 5 February.[250] No charges were brought. On 26 March 2008, secondnameplaceholder's spokesman said she was "doing well".[251] Her record company reportedly believed that her recovery remained fragile.[252] By late April 2008, her erratic behaviour—including an allegation of assault—caused fear that her drug rehabilitation efforts had been unsuccessful.[253] secondnameplaceholder's father and manager then sought to have her detained under the Mental Health Act of 1983.[254] Her dishevelled appearance during and after a scheduled club night in September 2008 sparked new rumours of a relapse. Photographers were quoted as saying she appeared to have cuts on her legs and arms.[255]According to her physician, secondnameplaceholder quit using illegal substances in 2008.[256] In an October 2010 interview, speaking of her decision to quit drugs, secondnameplaceholder said, "I literally woke up one day and was like, 'I don't want to do this any more.'"[257] However, alcohol emerged as a problem, with secondnameplaceholder abstaining for a few weeks and then lapsing into alcohol abuse.[256] Her physician said that secondnameplaceholder was treated with Librium for alcohol withdrawal and anxiety and underwent psychological and psychiatric evaluations in 2010, but refused psychological therapy.[256]In 2006, secondnameplaceholder admitted to punching a female fan in the face for criticising her having taken Blake Fielder-Civil as a husband. She then attacked her own spouse as he attempted to calm her down, kneeing him in the crotch.[225] In October 2007, secondnameplaceholder and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis. The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around £350).[258] secondnameplaceholder first appealed the fines,[258][259] but later dropped the appeal.[260]On 26 April 2008, secondnameplaceholder was cautioned after she admitted to police she slapped a 38-year-old man in the face, a "common assault" offence, her first of two. She voluntarily turned herself in and was held overnight. Police said, at her arrival she was "in no fit state" to be interviewed.[261] Ten days later, secondnameplaceholder was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs after a video of her apparently smoking crack cocaine was passed to the police in January, but was released on bail a few hours later because they could not confirm, from the video, what she was smoking.[242][262] The Crown Prosecution Service considered charging her, but cleared her when it could not establish that the substance in the video was a controlled drug.[263] Some members of Parliament reacted negatively.[264] Two London residents were subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine and ecstasy to secondnameplaceholder.[265] One of the pair was sentenced to two years in prison on 13 December 2008, while the other received a two-year community order.[266]On 5 March 2009, secondnameplaceholder was arrested and charged with common assault following a claim by dancer Sherene Flash that secondnameplaceholder hit her in the eye at the September 2008 Prince's Trust charity ball.[267] secondnameplaceholder's spokesperson announced the cancellation of the singer's US Coachella Festival appearance in light of the new legal issue,[268] and secondnameplaceholder appeared in court on 17 March to enter her plea of not guilty.[269] On 23 July, her trial began with prosecutor Lyall Thompson charging that secondnameplaceholder acted with "deliberate and unjustifiable violence" while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or another substance. She testified that she did not punch Flash, but tried to push her away because she was scared of her; she cited her worry that Flash would sell her story to a tabloid, Flash's height advantage, and Flash's "rude" behaviour.[270][271] On 24 July, District Judge Timothy Workman ruled that secondnameplaceholder was not guilty, citing the facts that all but two of the witnesses were intoxicated at the time of the incident and that medical evidence did not show "the sort of injury that often occurs when there is a forceful punch to the eye."[272]On 19 December 2009, secondnameplaceholder was arrested for a third time on charges of common assault, plus another charge of public order offence after assaulting the front-of-house manager of the Milton Keynes Theatre after he asked her to move from her seat.[273] secondnameplaceholder plead guilty to the charges and was given a conditional discharge.[274]With the paparazzi taking photographs of her wherever they could, secondnameplaceholder obtained an injunction against a leading paparazzi agency, Big Pictures, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the resultant court order issued by the High Court in 2009 banned them from following her.[275] Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing secondnameplaceholder in her home or the homes of her friends and relatives. According to a newspaper report, sources close to the singer said legal action was taken out of concern for the safety of secondnameplaceholder and those close to her.[275]On 23 June 2008, secondnameplaceholder's publicist corrected earlier misstatements by Mitch secondnameplaceholder that his daughter had early stage emphysema, instead claiming she had signs of what could lead to early-stage emphysema.[276] Mitch secondnameplaceholder had also stated that his daughter's lungs were operating at 70 percent capacity and that she had an irregular heartbeat. He said that these problems had been caused by her chain smoking crack cocaine. The singer's father also reported that doctors had warned secondnameplaceholder that, if she continued smoking crack cocaine, she would have to wear an oxygen mask and would eventually die.[277] In a radio interview, Mitch secondnameplaceholder said the singer was responding "fabulously" to treatment, which included being covered with nicotine patches.[278] British Lung Foundation spokesman Keith Prowse noted this type of condition could be managed with treatment. Prowse also said the condition was not normal for a person her age but "heavy smoking and inhaling other substances like drugs can age the lungs prematurely."[279] Norman H. Edelman of the American Lung Association explained that if she stopped smoking, her lung functions would decline at the rate of a normal person, but continued smoking would lead to a more rapid decline in lung function.[280]secondnameplaceholder was released from the London Clinic 24 hours after returning from a temporary leave to perform at Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday and at a concert in Glastonbury, and continued receiving treatment as an outpatient.[281] In July 2008, secondnameplaceholder stated that she had been diagnosed with "some areas of emphysema" and said she was getting herself together by "eating loads of healthy food, sleeping loads, playing my guitar, making music and writing letters to my husband every day."[282] She also kept a vertical tanning bed in her flat.[153] secondnameplaceholder began precautionary testing on her lungs and chest on 25 October 2008[283] at the London Clinic for what was reported as a chest infection. secondnameplaceholder was in and out of the facility and was granted permission to set her own schedule regarding home leave.[94] She returned to the hospital on 23 November 2008 for a reported reaction to her medication.[284]
<h2>Death</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's bodyguard said that he had arrived at her residence three days before her death and felt she had been somewhat intoxicated. He observed moderate drinking over the next few days, and said she had been "laughing, listening to music and watching TV at 2 a.m. the day of her death". At 10 a.m. BST on 23 July 2011, he observed her lying on her bed and tried unsuccessfully to rouse her. This did not raise much suspicion because she usually slept late after a night out. According to the bodyguard, shortly after 3 p.m., he checked on her again and observed her lying in the same position as before, leading to a further check, in which he concluded that she was not breathing and had no pulse; he said he called emergency services.[256] At 3:54 p.m., two ambulances were called to secondnameplaceholder's home in Camden, London.[285][286] secondnameplaceholder was pronounced dead at the scene.

The fact that secondnameplaceholder's focus is on highly accessible, enjoyable repertoire is not an argument against his musical credentials."[23]
