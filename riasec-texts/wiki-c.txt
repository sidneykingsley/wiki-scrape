firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] (listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 to 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,[a] becoming Chancellor in 1933 and then assuming the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934.[b] During his dictatorship from 1933 to 1945, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.secondnameplaceholder was born in Austria – then part of Austria-Hungary – and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"). After his early release in 1924, secondnameplaceholder gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy.By November 1932, the Nazi Party had the most seats in the German Reichstag but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint secondnameplaceholder as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. secondnameplaceholder aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which gave him significant popular support.secondnameplaceholder sought Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, secondnameplaceholder ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover Eva Braun in the Führerbunker in Berlin. Less than two days later, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their corpses were burned.Historian and biographer Ian Kershaw describes secondnameplaceholder as "the embodiment of modern political evil".[4] Under secondnameplaceholder's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of about 6 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. secondnameplaceholder and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.
<h2>Ancestry</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's father, Alois secondnameplaceholder Sr. (1837–1903), was the illegitimate child of Maria Anna Schicklgruber.[5] The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother's surname, 'Schicklgruber'. In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois's mother. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler.[6] In 1876, Alois was made legitimate and his baptismal record annotated by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as "Georg secondnameplaceholder").[7][8] Alois then assumed the surname "secondnameplaceholder",[8] also spelled 'Hiedler', 'Hüttler', or 'Huettler'. The name is probably based on the German word hütte (lit., "hut"), and likely has the meaning "one who lives in a hut".[9]Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois' mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois.[10] No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence,[11] and Jewish residency in Styria had been illegal for nearly 400 years and would not become legal again until decades after Alois' birth,[11][12] so historians dismiss the claim that Alois' father was Jewish.[13][14]
<h2>Early years</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire.[15] He was the fourth of six children born to Alois secondnameplaceholder and his third wife, Klara Pölzl. Three of secondnameplaceholder's siblings – Gustav, Ida, and Otto – died in infancy.[16] Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883).[17] When secondnameplaceholder was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany.[18] There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life.[19][20][21] The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. secondnameplaceholder attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.[22][23]The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by secondnameplaceholder's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.[24] His father beat him, although his mother tried to protect him.[25] Alois secondnameplaceholder's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old secondnameplaceholder took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.[26] In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. secondnameplaceholder was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. secondnameplaceholder changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.[27]Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.[28] secondnameplaceholder later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.[29][30][31] Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent secondnameplaceholder to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900.[c][32] secondnameplaceholder rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw "what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream".[33]Like many Austrian Germans, secondnameplaceholder began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age.[34] He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire.[35][36] secondnameplaceholder and his friends used the greeting "Heil", and sang the "Deutschlandlied" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.[37]After Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, secondnameplaceholder's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave.[38] He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.[39] In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, secondnameplaceholder left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.[40]In 1907, secondnameplaceholder left Linz to live and study fine art in Vienna, financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother. He applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna but was rejected twice.[41][42] The director suggested secondnameplaceholder should apply to the School of Architecture, but he lacked the necessary academic credentials because he had not finished secondary school.[43]On 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47, when he himself was 18. In 1909 secondnameplaceholder ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and a men's dormitory.[44][45] He earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna's sights.[41] During his time in Vienna, he pursued a growing passion for architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, his favourite Wagner opera.[46]It was in Vienna that secondnameplaceholder first became exposed to racist rhetoric.[47] Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the climate of virulent anti-Semitism and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where secondnameplaceholder lived.[48] Georg Ritter von Schönerer became a major influence on secondnameplaceholder.[49] He also developed an admiration for Martin Luther.[50] secondnameplaceholder read local newspapers such as Deutsches Volksblatt [de] that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews.[51] He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon and Arthur Schopenhauer.[52]The origin and development of secondnameplaceholder's anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate.[53] His friend, August Kubizek, claimed that secondnameplaceholder was a "confirmed anti-Semite" before he left Linz.[54] However, historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek's claim as "problematical".[55] While secondnameplaceholder states in Mein Kampf that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna,[56] Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him sell his paintings, disagrees. secondnameplaceholder had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna.[57][58][59] Historian Richard J. Evans states that "historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany's defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid "stab-in-the-back" explanation for the catastrophe".[60]secondnameplaceholder received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany.[61] When he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army,[62] he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed unfit for service, he returned to Munich.[63] secondnameplaceholder later claimed that he did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.[64]In August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, secondnameplaceholder was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army.[65] According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing secondnameplaceholder to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.[65] Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment),[66][65] he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium,[67] spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines.[68][69] He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme.[70] He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914.[70] On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, secondnameplaceholder's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of secondnameplaceholder's Gefreiter rank.[71][72] He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.[73]During his service at headquarters, secondnameplaceholder pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.[74] secondnameplaceholder spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.[75] On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk.[76] While there, secondnameplaceholder learned of Germany's defeat, and – by his own account – upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.[77]secondnameplaceholder described the war as "the greatest of all experiences", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.[78] His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918.[79] His bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.[80] Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, "undefeated in the field", had been "stabbed in the back" on the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, Marxists, and those who signed the armistice that ended the fighting—later dubbed the "November criminals".[81]The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany had to relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation. They especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.[82] The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by secondnameplaceholder for political gain.[83]
<h2>Entry into politics</h2>
After World War I, secondnameplaceholder returned to Munich.[84] Without formal education or career prospects, he remained in the army.[85] In July 1919 he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman Anton Drexler was impressed with secondnameplaceholder's oratorical skills. He gave him a copy of his pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas.[86] On the orders of his army superiors, secondnameplaceholder applied to join the party,[87] and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).[88][89]Around this time, secondnameplaceholder made his earliest known recorded statement about the Jews in a letter (now known as the Gemlich letter) dated 16 September 1919 to firstnameplaceholder Gemlich about the Jewish question. In the letter, secondnameplaceholder argues that the aim of the government "must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether".[90]At the DAP, secondnameplaceholder met Dietrich Eckart, one of the party's founders and a member of the occult Thule Society.[91] Eckart became secondnameplaceholder's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.[92] To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), known colloquially as the "Nazi Party").[93] secondnameplaceholder designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.[94]secondnameplaceholder was discharged from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the party.[95] The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic.[96] In February 1921 – already highly effective at crowd manipulation – he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.[97] To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. secondnameplaceholder soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.[98]In June 1921, while secondnameplaceholder and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the Nuremberg-based German Socialist Party (DSP).[99] secondnameplaceholder returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.[100] secondnameplaceholder announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.[101] The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. secondnameplaceholder continued to face some opposition within the Nazi Party. Opponents of secondnameplaceholder in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking secondnameplaceholder as a traitor to the party.[101][d] In the following days, secondnameplaceholder spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing Drexler, by a vote of 533 to 1.[102]secondnameplaceholder's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. A demagogue,[103] he became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners' economic hardships.[104][105][106] secondnameplaceholder used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking.[107][108] Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of his eyes in small groups.[109] Alfons Heck, a former member of the secondnameplaceholder Youth, recalled:Early followers included Rudolf Hess, former air force ace Hermann Göring, and army captain Ernst Röhm. Röhm became head of the Nazis' paramilitary organisation, the Sturmabteilung (SA, "Stormtroopers"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. A critical influence on secondnameplaceholder's thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung,[111] a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early Nazis. The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced secondnameplaceholder to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with Bolshevism.[112]The programme of the Nazi Party was laid out in their 25-point programme on 24 February 1920. This did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the völkisch Pan-Germanic movement, such as ultranationalism, opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, distrust of capitalism, as well as some socialist ideas. For secondnameplaceholder, though, the most important aspect of it was its strong anti-Semitic stance. He also perceived the programme as primarily a basis for propaganda and for attracting people to the party.[113]In 1923, secondnameplaceholder enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the "Beer Hall Putsch". The Nazi Party used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. secondnameplaceholder wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini's "March on Rome" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. secondnameplaceholder and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (State Commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without secondnameplaceholder.[114]On 8 November 1923, secondnameplaceholder and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.[115] Retiring to a back room, secondnameplaceholder, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.[115] secondnameplaceholder's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with secondnameplaceholder.[116] The next day, secondnameplaceholder and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.[117] Sixteen Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.[118]secondnameplaceholder fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide.[119] He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason.[120] His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924,[121] and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the Nazi Party. On 1 April, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison.[122] There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.[123] Including time on remand, secondnameplaceholder served just over one year in prison.[124]While at Landsberg, secondnameplaceholder dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) at first to his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, and then to his deputy, Rudolf Hess.[124][125] The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out secondnameplaceholder's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Throughout the book, Jews are equated with "germs" and presented as the "international poisoners" of society. According to secondnameplaceholder's ideology, the only solution was their extermination. While secondnameplaceholder did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished, his "inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable", according to Ian Kershaw.[126]Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, Mein Kampf sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, secondnameplaceholder's first year in office.[127]Shortly before secondnameplaceholder was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported to Austria.[128] The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.[129] In response, secondnameplaceholder formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.[129]At the time of secondnameplaceholder's release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting secondnameplaceholder's opportunities for political agitation. As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, secondnameplaceholder agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for the ban on the Nazi Party to be lifted on 16 February.[130] However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, secondnameplaceholder was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.[131][132] To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, secondnameplaceholder appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser and Joseph Goebbels to organise and enlarge the Nazi Party in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.[133]The stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929. The impact in Germany was dire: millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. secondnameplaceholder and the Nazi Party prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs.[134]
<h2>Rise to power</h2>
The Great Depression provided a political opportunity for secondnameplaceholder. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.[136] The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government.[137] The Nazi Party rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.[138]secondnameplaceholder made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hanns Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the Nazi Party, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel.[139] The prosecution argued that the Nazi Party was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on secondnameplaceholder to testify.[140] On 25 September 1930, secondnameplaceholder testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections,[141] which won him many supporters in the officer corps.[142]Brüning's austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular.[143] secondnameplaceholder exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.[144]Although secondnameplaceholder had terminated his Austrian citizenship in 1925, he did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. This meant that he was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.[145] On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, who was a member of the Nazi Party, appointed secondnameplaceholder as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making secondnameplaceholder a citizen of Brunswick,[146] and thus of Germany.[147]secondnameplaceholder ran against Hindenburg in the 1932 presidential elections. A speech to the Industry Club in Düsseldorf on 27 January 1932 won him support from many of Germany's most powerful industrialists.[148] Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and republican parties, and some Social Democrats. secondnameplaceholder used the campaign slogan "secondnameplaceholder über Deutschland" ("secondnameplaceholder over Germany"), a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft.[149] He was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for political purposes, and used it effectively.[150][151] secondnameplaceholder came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election. Although he lost to Hindenburg, this election established secondnameplaceholder as a strong force in German politics.[152]The absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to Hindenburg. The signers urged Hindenburg to appoint secondnameplaceholder as leader of a government "independent from parliamentary parties", which could turn into a movement that would "enrapture millions of people".[153][154]Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint secondnameplaceholder as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections – in July and November 1932 – had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. secondnameplaceholder headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the Nazi Party (which had the most seats in the Reichstag) and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The Nazi Party gained three posts: secondnameplaceholder was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.[155] secondnameplaceholder had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.[156]As chancellor, secondnameplaceholder worked against attempts by the Nazi Party's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.[157] Until the 1960s, some historians including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock thought the Nazi Party itself was responsible,[158][159] the current consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire alone.[160]  At secondnameplaceholder's urging, Hindenburg responded by signing the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, drafted by the Nazis, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.[161] Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested.[162]In addition to political campaigning, the Nazi Party engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the Nazi Party's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. secondnameplaceholder's party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.[163]On 21 March 1933, the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam. This "Day of Potsdam" was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military. secondnameplaceholder appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg.[164][165]To achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, secondnameplaceholder's government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag. The Act – officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich") – gave secondnameplaceholder's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.[166] Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election)[167] and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.[168]On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.[169] The position of the Centre Party, the third-largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive. After secondnameplaceholder verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act passed by a vote of 441–84, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed secondnameplaceholder's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.[170]Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, secondnameplaceholder and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized.[172] While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers occupied union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933, all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps.[173] The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of Nazism in the spirit of secondnameplaceholder's Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community").[174]By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. This included the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, secondnameplaceholder forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.[174][172] The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, secondnameplaceholder purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.[175] secondnameplaceholder targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of secondnameplaceholder's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot.[176] While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the murders, many in Germany believed secondnameplaceholder was restoring order.[177]On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died. The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the "Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich".[3] This law stated that upon Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. secondnameplaceholder thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor),[2] although Reichskanzler was eventually quietly dropped.[178] With this action, secondnameplaceholder eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.[179]As head of state, secondnameplaceholder became commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Immediately after Hindenburg's death, at the instigation of the leadership of the Reichswehr, the traditional loyalty oath of soldiers was altered to affirm loyalty to secondnameplaceholder personally, by name, rather than to the office of commander-in-chief (which was later renamed to supreme commander) or the state.[180] On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.[181]In early 1938, secondnameplaceholder used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg–Fritsch affair. secondnameplaceholder forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that Blomberg's new wife had a record for prostitution.[182][183] Army commander Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship.[184] Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to secondnameplaceholder's demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938.[185] secondnameplaceholder assumed Blomberg's title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces. He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel. On the same day, sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi.[186] By early February 1938, twelve more generals had been removed.[187]secondnameplaceholder took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. Many of his decrees were explicitly based on the Reichstag Fire Decree and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. The Reichstag renewed the Enabling Act twice, each time for a four-year period.[188] While elections to the Reichstag were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro-Nazi "guests" which carried with well over 90 per cent of the vote.[189] These elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the Nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who did not vote or dared to vote no.[190]
<h2>Nazi Germany</h2>
In August 1934, secondnameplaceholder appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.[191] Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews.[192] Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936.[193] secondnameplaceholder oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.[194] The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.[195]secondnameplaceholder's government sponsored architecture on an immense scale. Albert Speer, instrumental in implementing secondnameplaceholder's classicist reinterpretation of German culture, was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin.[196] Despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, Germany hosted the 1936 Olympic Games. secondnameplaceholder officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Summer Games in Berlin.[197]In a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933, secondnameplaceholder spoke of "conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation" as his ultimate foreign policy objectives.[198] In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von Bülow, secretary at the Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany's national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, the return of the former German colonies in Africa, and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe. secondnameplaceholder found Bülow's goals to be too modest.[199] In speeches during this period, he stressed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements.[200] At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, secondnameplaceholder prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.[201]Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933.[202] In January 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland, then under League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany.[203] That March, secondnameplaceholder announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members – six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty – including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine). Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty, but did nothing to stop it.[204][205] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the British navy. secondnameplaceholder called the signing of the AGNA "the happiest day of his life", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf.[206] France and Italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance.[207]Germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936, in violation of the Versailles Treaty. secondnameplaceholder also sent troops to Spain to support General Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936. At the same time, secondnameplaceholder continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance.[208] In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, secondnameplaceholder ordered Göring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years.[209] The plan envisaged an all-out struggle between "Judeo-Bolshevism" and German Nazism, which in secondnameplaceholder's view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.[210]In October 1936, Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini's government, visited Germany, where he signed a Nine-Point Protocol as an expression of rapprochement and had a personal meeting with secondnameplaceholder. On 1 November, Mussolini declared an "axis" between Germany and Italy.[211] On 25 November, Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan. Britain, China, Italy, and Poland were also invited to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but only Italy signed in 1937. secondnameplaceholder abandoned his plan of an Anglo-German alliance, blaming "inadequate" British leadership.[212] At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November, secondnameplaceholder restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people. He ordered preparations for war in the East, to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943. In the event of his death, the conference minutes, recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum, were to be regarded as his "political testament".[213] He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.[214][215] secondnameplaceholder urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race.[214] In early 1938, in the wake of the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, secondnameplaceholder asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as War Minister.[209] From early 1938 onwards, secondnameplaceholder was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war.[216]
<h2>World War II</h2>
In February 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, secondnameplaceholder ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. secondnameplaceholder announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan.[217] secondnameplaceholder ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army.[217] In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.[218]On 12 March 1938, secondnameplaceholder announced the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss.[219][220] secondnameplaceholder then turned his attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.[221] On 28–29 March 1938, secondnameplaceholder held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland. The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovakian government, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia. In April 1938 Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that "whatever the Czech government might offer, he would always raise still higher demands ... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly".[222] In private, secondnameplaceholder considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.[223]In April secondnameplaceholder ordered the OKW to prepare for 
Fall Grün (Case Green), the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia.[224] As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure, on 5 September Czechoslovakian President Edvard Beneš unveiled the "Fourth Plan" for constitutional reorganisation of his country, which agreed to most of Henlein's demands for Sudeten autonomy.[225] Henlein's party responded to Beneš' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts.[226][227]Germany was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies. This forced secondnameplaceholder to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938.[228] On 29 September secondnameplaceholder, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.[229][230]Chamberlain was satisfied with the Munich conference, calling the outcome "peace for our time", while secondnameplaceholder was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938;[231][232] he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbrücken.[233] In secondnameplaceholder's view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of Germany.[234][235] As a result of the summit, secondnameplaceholder was selected Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.[236]In late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced secondnameplaceholder to make major defence cuts.[237] In his "Export or die" speech of 30 January 1939, he called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.[237]On 14 March 1939, under threat from Hungary, Slovakia declared independence and received protection from Germany.[238] The next day, in violation of the Munich accord and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets,[239] secondnameplaceholder ordered the Wehrmacht to invade the Czech rump state, and from Prague Castle he proclaimed the territory a German protectorate.[240]In private discussions in 1939, secondnameplaceholder declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland's obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal.[241] The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany's Lebensraum.[242] Offended by the British "guarantee" on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, he said, "I shall brew them a devil's drink".[243] In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April, he threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence, which he perceived as an "encirclement" policy.[243] Poland was to either become a German satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure the Reich's eastern flank and prevent a possible British blockade.[244] secondnameplaceholder initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the Polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939.[245] On 3 April, secondnameplaceholder ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss ("Case White"), the plan for invading Poland on 25 August.[245] In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, he renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact.[246] Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Ian Kershaw have argued that one reason for secondnameplaceholder's rush to war was his fear of an early death. He had repeatedly claimed that he must lead Germany into war before he got too old, as his successors might lack his strength of will.[247][248][249]secondnameplaceholder was concerned that a military attack against Poland could result in a premature war with Britain.[244][250] secondnameplaceholder's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland.[251][252] Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 secondnameplaceholder ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.[253]This plan required tacit Soviet support,[254] and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, included a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two countries.[255] Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939. This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted secondnameplaceholder to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September.[256] secondnameplaceholder unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.[257][258]On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded western Poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the Free City of Danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the Polish Corridor, which Germany had ceded under the Versailles Treaty.[259] In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, surprising secondnameplaceholder and prompting him to angrily ask Ribbentrop, "Now what?"[260] France and Britain did not act on their declarations immediately, and on 17 September, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland.[261]The fall of Poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the "Phoney War" or Sitzkrieg ("sitting war"). secondnameplaceholder instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, to Germanise their areas, with "no questions asked" about how this was accomplished.[262] In Forster's area, ethnic Poles merely had to sign forms stating that they had German blood.[263] In contrast, Greiser agreed with Himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards Poles. Greiser soon complained that Forster was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as "racial" Germans and thus endangered German "racial purity".[262] secondnameplaceholder refrained from getting involved. This inaction has been advanced as an example of the theory of "working towards the Führer", in which secondnameplaceholder issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own.[262][264]Another dispute pitched one side represented by Heinrich Himmler and Greiser, who championed ethnic cleansing in Poland, against another represented by Göring and Hans Frank (governor-general of occupied Poland), who called for turning Poland into the "granary" of the Reich.[265] On 12 February 1940, the dispute was initially settled in favour of the Göring–Frank view, which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions.[265] On 15 May 1940, Himmler issued a memo entitled "Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East", calling for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Europe into Africa and the reduction of the Polish population to a "leaderless class of labourers".[265] secondnameplaceholder called Himmler's memo "good and correct",[265] and, ignoring Göring and Frank, implemented the Himmler–Greiser policy in Poland.On 9 April, German forces invaded Denmark and Norway. On the same day secondnameplaceholder proclaimed the birth of the Greater Germanic Reich, his vision of a united empire of Germanic nations of Europe in which the Dutch, Flemish, and Scandinavians were joined into a "racially pure" polity under German leadership.[266] In May 1940, Germany attacked France, and conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. These victories prompted Mussolini to have Italy join forces with secondnameplaceholder on 10 June. France and Germany signed an armistice on 22 June.[267] Kershaw notes that secondnameplaceholder's popularity within Germany – and German support for the war – reached its peak when he returned to Berlin on 6 July from his tour of Paris.[268] Following the unexpected swift victory, secondnameplaceholder promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.[269][270]Britain, whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk,[271] continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic. secondnameplaceholder made peace overtures to the new British leader, Winston Churchill, and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in southeast England. On 7 September the systematic nightly bombing of London began. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain.[272] By the end of September, secondnameplaceholder realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) could not be achieved, and ordered the operation postponed. The nightly air raids on British cities intensified and continued for months, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry.[273]On 27 September 1940, the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin by Saburō Kurusu of Imperial Japan, secondnameplaceholder, and Italian foreign minister Ciano,[274] and later expanded to include Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, thus yielding the Axis powers. secondnameplaceholder's attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between secondnameplaceholder and Molotov in Berlin in November, and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union.[275]In early 1941, German forces were deployed to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. In February, German forces arrived in Libya to bolster the Italian presence. In April, secondnameplaceholder launched the invasion of Yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of Greece.[276] In May, German forces were sent to support Iraqi forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete.[277]On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, over three million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union.[278] This offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers.[279][280] The invasion conquered a huge area, including the Baltic republics, Belarus, and West Ukraine. By early August, Axis troops had advanced 500 km (310 mi) and won the Battle of Smolensk. secondnameplaceholder ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt its advance to Moscow and divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev.[281] His generals disagreed with this change, having advanced within 400 km (250 mi) of Moscow, and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership.[282][283] The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 and ended disastrously in December.[281] During this crisis, secondnameplaceholder appointed himself as head of the Oberkommando des Heeres.[284]On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, secondnameplaceholder declared war against the United States.[285]On 18 December 1941, Himmler asked secondnameplaceholder, "What to do with the Jews of Russia?", to which secondnameplaceholder replied, "als Partisanen auszurotten" ("exterminate them as partisans").[286] Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from secondnameplaceholder for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.[286]In late 1942, German forces were defeated in the second battle of El Alamein,[287] thwarting secondnameplaceholder's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, secondnameplaceholder became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences.[288] In December 1942 and January 1943, secondnameplaceholder's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner.[289] Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk.[290] secondnameplaceholder's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did secondnameplaceholder's health.[291]Following the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, Mussolini was removed from power by King Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of no confidence of the Grand Council of Fascism. Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed in charge of the government, soon surrendered to the Allies.[292] Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced secondnameplaceholder's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front. On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord.[293] Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under secondnameplaceholder's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.[294]Between 1939 and 1945, there were many plans to assassinate secondnameplaceholder, some of which proceeded to significant degrees.[295] The most well known, the 20 July plot of 1944, came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war.[296] Part of Operation Valkyrie, the plot involved Claus von Stauffenberg planting a bomb in one of secondnameplaceholder's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. secondnameplaceholder narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, secondnameplaceholder ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people.[297]By late 1944, both the Red Army and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany. Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army, secondnameplaceholder decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British troops, which he perceived as far weaker.[298] On 16 December, he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets.[299] After some temporary successes, the offensive failed.[300] With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, secondnameplaceholder spoke on the radio: "However grave as the crisis may be at this moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will."[301] Acting on his view that Germany's military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation, secondnameplaceholder ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands.[302] Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.[302][303] secondnameplaceholder's hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the Allies.[299][304]On 20 April, his 56th birthday, secondnameplaceholder made his last trip from the Führerbunker (Führer's shelter) to the surface. In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the secondnameplaceholder Youth, who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin.[305] By 21 April, Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced to the outskirts of Berlin.[306] In denial about the dire situation, secondnameplaceholder placed his hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Felix Steiner. secondnameplaceholder ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.[307]During a military conference on 22 April, secondnameplaceholder asked about Steiner's offensive. He was told that the attack had not been launched and that the Soviets had entered Berlin. secondnameplaceholder asked everyone except Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room,[308] then launched into a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders, culminating in his declaration – for the first time – that "everything was lost".[309] He announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.[310]By 23 April the Red Army had surrounded Berlin,[311] and Goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city.[308] That same day, Göring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that since secondnameplaceholder was isolated in Berlin, Göring should assume leadership of Germany. Göring set a deadline, after which he would consider secondnameplaceholder incapacitated.[312] secondnameplaceholder responded by having Göring arrested, and in his last will and testament of 29 April, he removed Göring from all government positions.[313][314] On 28 April secondnameplaceholder discovered that Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies.[315][316] He ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at secondnameplaceholder's HQ in Berlin) shot.[317]After midnight on the night of 28–29 April, secondnameplaceholder married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the Führerbunker.[318][e] Later that afternoon, secondnameplaceholder was informed that Mussolini had been executed by the Italian resistance movement on the previous day; this presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.[319]On 30 April 1945, Soviet troops were within a block or two of the Reich Chancellery when secondnameplaceholder shot himself in the head and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule.[320][321] Their corpses were carried outside to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater, doused with petrol, and set on fire as the Red Army shelling continued.[322][323][324] Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed secondnameplaceholder's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.[325]Berlin surrendered on 2 May. The remains of Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and secondnameplaceholder's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed.[326] secondnameplaceholder and Braun's remains were alleged to have been moved as well, but this is most likely Soviet disinformation. There is no evidence that any actual bodily remains of secondnameplaceholder or Braun – with the exception of the dental bridges – were found by the Soviets, which could be identified as their remains.[327][328][329] In 1946, the remains of Goebbels and the others were exhumed again and moved to the SMERSH unit's then new facility in Magdeburg, where they were buried in five wooden boxes on 21 February.[330][331] By 1970, the facility was under the control of the KGB and scheduled to be relinquished to East Germany. A KGB team was given detailed burial charts and on 4 April 1970 secretly exhumed the remains of ten or eleven bodies "in an advanced state of decay". The remains were thoroughly burned and crushed, and the ashes thrown into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.[332]
<h2>The Holocaust</h2>
The Holocaust and Germany's war in the East were based on secondnameplaceholder's long-standing view that the Jews were the enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion. He focused on Eastern Europe for this expansion, aiming to defeat Poland and the Soviet Union and then removing or killing the Jews and Slavs.[334] The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to West Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered;[335] the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or "Germanised" settlers.[336] The goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when this failed, secondnameplaceholder moved the plans forward.[335][337] By January 1942, he had decided that the Jews, Slavs, and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed.[338][f]The genocide was organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich. The records of the Wannsee Conference, held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich, with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating, provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust. On 22 February, secondnameplaceholder was recorded saying, "we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews".[339] Similarly, at a meeting in July 1941 with leading functionaries of the Eastern territories, secondnameplaceholder said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the areas would be best achieved by "shooting everyone who even looks odd".[340] Although no direct order from secondnameplaceholder authorising the mass killings has surfaced,[341] his public speeches, orders to his generals, and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry.[342][343] During the war, secondnameplaceholder repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled, namely, that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the Jewish race.[344] secondnameplaceholder approved the Einsatzgruppen – killing squads that followed the German army through Poland, the Baltic, and the Soviet Union[345] – and was well informed about their activities.[342][346] By summer 1942, Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for killing or enslavement.[347] Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe, with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination.[348]Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million non-combatants,[349][335] including about 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe),[350][g] and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people.[352][350] Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers.[353] In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.[354] Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union.[355] These partially fulfilled plans resulted in additional deaths, bringing the total number of civilians and prisoners of war who died in the democide to an estimated 19.3 million people.[356]secondnameplaceholder's policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Polish civilians,[357] over three million Soviet prisoners of war,[358] communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled,[359][360] Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. secondnameplaceholder did not speak publicly about the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.[361]The Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene. On 15 September 1935, secondnameplaceholder presented two laws – known as the Nuremberg Laws – to the Reichstag. The laws banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".[362] The laws stripped all non-Aryans of their German citizenship and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households.[363] secondnameplaceholder's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed Action Brandt, and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as Aktion T4.[364]
<h2>Leadership style</h2>
secondnameplaceholder ruled the Nazi Party autocratically by asserting the Führerprinzip (leader principle). The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself – the infallible leader – at the apex. Rank in the party was not determined by elections – positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.[365] secondnameplaceholder's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have "the stronger one [do] the job".[366] In this way, secondnameplaceholder fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.[367][368] secondnameplaceholder typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated verbally, or had them conveyed through his close associate, Martin Bormann.[369] He entrusted Bormann with his paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to secondnameplaceholder.[370]secondnameplaceholder dominated his country's war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader. He strengthened his control of the armed forces in 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy. His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure.[371] secondnameplaceholder deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy.[372] secondnameplaceholder's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory.[371] In the final months of the war secondnameplaceholder refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender.[373] The military did not challenge secondnameplaceholder's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.[374]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation.[145][375] He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929,[376] and married her on 29 April 1945, one day before they both committed suicide.[377] In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with secondnameplaceholder's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death was a source of deep, lasting pain.[378] Paula secondnameplaceholder, the younger sister of secondnameplaceholder and the last living member of his immediate family, died in June 1960.[16]secondnameplaceholder was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anticlerical father; after leaving home secondnameplaceholder never again attended Mass or received the sacraments.[379][380][381] Speer states that secondnameplaceholder railed against the church to his political associates and though he never officially left it, he had no attachment to it.[382] He adds that secondnameplaceholder felt that in the absence of organised religion, people would turn to mysticism, which he considered regressive.[382] According to Speer, secondnameplaceholder believed that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity, with its "meekness and flabbiness".[383]Historian John S. Conway states that secondnameplaceholder was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches.[384] According to Bullock, secondnameplaceholder did not believe in God, was anticlerical, and held Christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of "survival of the fittest".[385] He favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited his own views, and adopted some elements of the Catholic Church's hierarchical organisation, liturgy, and phraseology.[386]secondnameplaceholder viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society,[387] and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that "suited his immediate political purposes".[384] In public, secondnameplaceholder often praised Christian heritage and German Christian culture, though professing a belief in an "Aryan Jesus" who fought against the Jews.[388] Any pro-Christian public rhetoric contradicted his private statements, which described Christianity as "absurdity"[389] and nonsense founded on lies.[390]According to a US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report, "The Nazi Master Plan", secondnameplaceholder planned to destroy the influence of Christian churches within the Reich.[391][392] His eventual goal was the total elimination of Christianity.[393] This goal informed secondnameplaceholder's movement early on, but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position.[394] According to Bullock, secondnameplaceholder wanted to wait until after the war before executing this plan.[395]Speer wrote that secondnameplaceholder had a negative view of Himmler's and Alfred Rosenberg's mystical notions and Himmler's attempt to mythologise the SS. secondnameplaceholder was more pragmatic, and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns.[396][397]Researchers have variously suggested that secondnameplaceholder suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis,[398] Parkinson's disease,[291][399] syphilis,[399] giant-cell arteritis,[400] and tinnitus.[401] In a report prepared for the OSS in 1943, Walter C. Langer of Harvard University described secondnameplaceholder as a "neurotic psychopath".[402] In his 1977 book The Psychopathic God: firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that he suffered from borderline personality disorder.[403] Historians Henrik Eberle and Hans-Joachim Neumann consider that while he suffered from a number of illnesses including Parkinson's disease, secondnameplaceholder did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, his decisions.[404][309] Theories about secondnameplaceholder's medical condition are difficult to prove, and placing too much weight on them may have the effect of attributing many of the events and consequences of Nazi Germany to the possibly impaired physical health of one individual.[405] According to Kershaw, it is better to take a broader view of German history by examining what social forces led to the Nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for the Holocaust and World War II based on only one person.[406]Sometime in the 1930s secondnameplaceholder adopted a mainly vegetarian diet,[407][408] avoiding all meat and fish from 1942 onwards. At social events he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his guests shun meat.[409] Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof (near Berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for secondnameplaceholder.[410]secondnameplaceholder stopped drinking alcohol around the time he became vegetarian and thereafter only very occasionally drank beer or wine on social occasions.[411][412] He was a non-smoker for most of his adult life, but smoked heavily in his youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); he eventually quit, calling the habit "a waste of money".[413] He encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit.[414] secondnameplaceholder began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942.[415] Speer linked this use of amphetamine to secondnameplaceholder's increasingly erratic behaviour and inflexible decision making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).[416]Prescribed 90 medications during the war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, secondnameplaceholder took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments.[417] He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine,[418][419] as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills).[420] He suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of the 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs.[421] Newsreel footage of secondnameplaceholder shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life.[417] Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met secondnameplaceholder in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.[422]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's suicide was likened by contemporaries to a "spell" being broken.[424][425] Public support for secondnameplaceholder had collapsed by the time of his death and few Germans mourned his passing; Kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest.[426] According to historian John Toland, Nazism "burst like a bubble" without its leader.[427]Kershaw describes secondnameplaceholder as "the embodiment of modern political evil".[4] "Never in history has such ruination – physical and moral – been associated with the name of one man", he adds.[428] secondnameplaceholder's political programme brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Eastern and Central Europe. Germany suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour).[429] secondnameplaceholder's policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale;[430] according to R. J. Rummel, the Nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.[349] In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II.[349] The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.[431] Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word "evil" to describe the Nazi regime.[432] Many European countries have criminalised both the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial.[433]Historian Friedrich Meinecke described secondnameplaceholder as "one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life".[434] English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper saw him as "among the 'terrible simplifiers' of history, the most systematic, the most historical, the most philosophical, and yet the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known".[435] For the historian John M. Roberts, secondnameplaceholder's defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany.[436] In its place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union.[437] Historian Sebastian Haffner asserts that without secondnameplaceholder and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation state of Israel would not exist. He contends that without secondnameplaceholder, the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed.[438] Further, Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great, secondnameplaceholder had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.[439]secondnameplaceholder exploited documentary films and newsreels to inspire a cult of personality. He was involved and appeared in a series of propaganda films throughout his political career, many made by Leni Riefenstahl, regarded as a pioneer of modern filmmaking.[440] secondnameplaceholder's propaganda film appearances include:Informational notesCitationsBibliography

firstnameplaceholderphonse Gabriel secondnameplaceholder (/kəˈpoʊn/;[1] January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947), sometimes known by the nickname "Scarface", was an American gangster and businessman who attained notoriety during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit. His seven-year reign as a crime boss ended when he went to prison at the age of 33.secondnameplaceholder was born in New York City in 1899 to Italian immigrant parents. He joined the Five Points Gang as a teenager and became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels. In his early twenties, he moved to Chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for Johnny Torrio, head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol—the forerunner of the Outfit—and was politically protected through the Unione Siciliana. A conflict with the North Side Gang was instrumental in secondnameplaceholder's rise and fall. Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to secondnameplaceholder. secondnameplaceholder expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city's police meant he seemed safe from law enforcement.secondnameplaceholder apparently reveled in attention, such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games. He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many as a "modern-day Robin Hood".[2] However, the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, in which seven gang rivals were murdered in broad daylight, damaged the public image of Chicago and secondnameplaceholder, leading influential citizens to demand government action and newspapers to dub secondnameplaceholder "Public Enemy No.1".The federal authorities became intent on jailing secondnameplaceholder and charged him with 22 counts of tax evasion. He was convicted of five counts in 1931. During a highly publicized case, the judge admitted as evidence secondnameplaceholder's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes, made during prior (and ultimately abortive) negotiations to pay the government taxes he owed. He was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. After conviction, he replaced his defense team with experts in tax law, and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a Supreme Court ruling, but his appeal ultimately failed. secondnameplaceholder showed signs of neurosyphilis early in his sentence and became increasingly debilitated before being released after almost eight years of incarceration. On January 25, 1947, he died of cardiac arrest after suffering a stroke.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born in Brooklyn, New York on January 17, 1899.[3] His parents were Italian immigrants Gabriele secondnameplaceholder (1865–1920) and Teresa secondnameplaceholder (née Raiola; 1867–1952).[4] His father was a barber and his mother was a seamstress, both born in Angri, a small commune outside of Naples in the Province of Salerno.[5][6] secondnameplaceholder's family had immigrated to the United States in 1893 by ship, first going through Fiume (modern-day Rijeka, Croatia), a port city in what was then Austria-Hungary.[3][7] The family settled at 95 Navy Street, in the Navy Yard section of Brooklyn, New York City. Gabriele secondnameplaceholder worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 Park Avenue. When firstnameplaceholder was 11, he and his family moved to 38 Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[3]Gabriele and Teresa had eight other children: Vincenzo secondnameplaceholder, who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became a Prohibition agent in Homer, Nebraska; Raffaele James secondnameplaceholder, also known as Ralph "Bottles" secondnameplaceholder, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry; Salvatore "Frank" secondnameplaceholder, Ermina secondnameplaceholder, who died at the age of one, Ermino "John" secondnameplaceholder, firstnameplaceholderbert secondnameplaceholder, Matthew secondnameplaceholder, and Mafalda secondnameplaceholder. Ralph and Frank worked with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in his criminal empire. Frank did so until his death on April 1, 1924.[8] Ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on and was also the front man for the Chicago Outfit for some time, until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932.[9]secondnameplaceholder showed promise as a student but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial Catholic school. His schooling ended at the age of 14 after he was expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face.[10] He worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store and a bowling alley.[11] From 1916 to 1918, he played semi-professional baseball.[12] Following this, secondnameplaceholder was influenced by gangster Johnny Torrio, whom he came to regard as a mentor.[13]secondnameplaceholder married Mae Josephine Coughlin at age 19, on December 30, 1918. She was Irish Catholic and earlier that month had given birth to their son firstnameplaceholderbert Francis "Sonny" secondnameplaceholder (1918–2004). firstnameplaceholderbert lost most of his hearing in his left ear as a child. secondnameplaceholder was under the age of 21, and his parents had to consent in writing to the marriage.[14] By all accounts, the two had a happy marriage despite his criminal lifestyle.[15]
<h2>Career</h2>
secondnameplaceholder initially became involved with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys. He then joined the Brooklyn Rippers, and then the powerful Five Points Gang based in Lower Manhattan. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer Frankie Yale, a bartender in a Coney Island dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. secondnameplaceholder inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door, and he was slashed with a knife three times on the left side of his face by her brother Frank Galluccio; the wounds led to the nickname "Scarface" which secondnameplaceholder loathed.[16][17][18] The date when this occurred has been reported with inconsistencies.[19][20][21] When secondnameplaceholder was photographed, he hid the scarred left side of his face, saying that the injuries were war wounds.[17][22] He was called "Snorky" by his closest friends, a term for a sharp dresser.[23]In 1919, secondnameplaceholder left New York City for Chicago at the invitation of Johnny Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James "Big Jim" Colosimo as an enforcer. secondnameplaceholder began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where he contracted syphilis. Timely use of Salvarsan probably could have cured the infection, but he apparently never sought treatment.[24] In 1923, he purchased a small house at 7244 South Prairie Avenue in the Park Manor neighborhood in the city's south side for US$5,500.[25] According to the Chicago Daily Tribune, hijacker Joe Howard was killed on May 7, 1923 after he tried to interfere with the secondnameplaceholder-Torrio bootleg beer business.[26] In the early years of the decade, his name began appearing in newspaper sports pages where he was described as a boxing promoter.[27] Torrio took over Colosimo's crime empire after the latter's murder on May 11, 1920, in which secondnameplaceholder was suspected of being involved.[10][28][29]Torrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with secondnameplaceholder as his right-hand man. He was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller North Side Gang led by Dean O'Banion came under pressure from the Genna brothers who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that Torrio was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side, despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes.[30] In a fateful step, Torrio arranged the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop on November 10, 1924. This placed Hymie Weiss at the head of the gang, backed by Vincent Drucci and Bugs Moran. Weiss had been a close friend of O'Banion, and the North Siders made it a priority to get revenge on his killers.[31][32][33]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was a frequent visitor to RyeMabee in Monteagle, Tennessee, "when he was traveling between Chicago and his Florida estate in Miami."[34]During Prohibition in the United States, secondnameplaceholder was involved with bootleggers in Canada, who helped him smuggle liquor into the US. When secondnameplaceholder was asked if he knew Rocco Perri, billed as Canada's "King of the Bootleggers", he replied: "Why, I don't even know which street Canada is on."[35] Other sources, however, claim that secondnameplaceholder had certainly visited Canada,[36] where he maintained some hideaways,[37] but the Royal Canadian Mounted Police states that there is no "evidence that he ever set foot on Canadian soil."[38]In January 1925, secondnameplaceholder was ambushed, leaving him shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip when he was shot several times. After recovering, he effectively resigned and handed control to secondnameplaceholder, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection. In turn, he was able to use more violence to increase revenue. An establishment that refused to purchase liquor from him often got blown up, and as many as 100 people were killed in such bombings during the 1920s. Rivals saw secondnameplaceholder as responsible for the proliferation of brothels in the city.[33][39][40][41]secondnameplaceholder often enlisted the help of local members of the black community into his operations; jazz musicians Milt Hinton and Lionel Hampton had uncles who worked for secondnameplaceholder on the South Side of Chicago. A fan of jazz as well, secondnameplaceholder once requested clarinetist Johnny Dodds to play a number that Dodds did not know; secondnameplaceholder split a $100 bill in half and told Dodds that he would get the other half when it was learned. secondnameplaceholder had also sent two bodyguards to accompany jazz pianist Earl Hines on a road trip.[42]secondnameplaceholder indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink, and female companionship. He was particularly known for his flamboyant and costly jewelry. His favorite responses to questions about his activities were: "I am just a businessman, giving the people what they want"; and, "firstnameplaceholderl I do is satisfy a public demand." secondnameplaceholder had become a national celebrity and talking point.[16]He based himself in Cicero, Illinois, after using bribery and widespread intimidation to take over town council elections (such as the 1924 Cicero municipal elections), and this made it difficult for the North Siders to target him.[43] His driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on Weiss's life in the Chicago Loop. On September 20, 1926, the North Side Gang used a ploy outside the secondnameplaceholder headquarters at the Hawthorne Inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with Thompson submachine guns and shotguns at the windows of the first-floor restaurant. secondnameplaceholder was unhurt and called for a truce, but the negotiations fell through. Three weeks later, on October 11, Weiss was killed outside the former O'Banion flower shop North Side headquarters. The owner of Hawthorne's restaurant was a friend of secondnameplaceholder's, and he was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci in January 1927.[44][45] Reports of secondnameplaceholder's intimidation became well known to the point where it was alleged that some companies, such as the makers of Vine-Glo, would use supposed secondnameplaceholder threats as a marketing tactic.[46][47]secondnameplaceholder became increasingly security-minded and desirous of getting away from Chicago.[45][48] As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire Pullman sleeper car on a night train to Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, Little Rock, or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, secondnameplaceholder paid $40,000 to Clarence Busch of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family for a 10,000 square foot (930 m2) home at 93 Palm Avenue on Palm Island, Florida, in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach.[49]In November 1925, Antonio Lombardo was named head of the Unione Siciliana, a Sicilian-American benevolent society that had been corrupted by gangsters. An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, believed secondnameplaceholder was responsible for Lombardo's ascension and he resented the non-Sicilian's attempts to manipulate affairs within the Unione.[50] Aiello severed all personal and business ties with Lombardo and entered into a feud with him and secondnameplaceholder.[50][51] Aiello allied himself with several other secondnameplaceholder enemies, including Jack Zuta, who ran vice and gambling houses together.[52][53] Aiello plotted to eliminate both Lombardo and secondnameplaceholder, and starting in the spring of 1927, made several attempts to assassinate secondnameplaceholder.[51] On one occasion, Aiello offered money to the chef of Joseph "Diamond Joe" Esposito's Bella Napoli Café, secondnameplaceholder's favorite restaurant, to put prussic acid in secondnameplaceholder's and Lombardo's soup; reports indicated he offered between $10,000 and $35,000.[50][54] Instead, the chef exposed the plot to secondnameplaceholder,[51][55] who responded by dispatching men to destroy one of Aiello's stores on West Division Street with machine-gun fire.[51] More than 200 bullets were fired into the Aiello Brothers Bakery on May 28, 1927, wounding Joe's brother Antonio.[50] During the summer and autumn of 1927 a number of hitmen Aiello hired to kill secondnameplaceholder were themselves slain. Among them were Anthony Russo and Vincent Spicuzza, each of whom had been offered $25,000 by Aiello to kill secondnameplaceholder and Lombardo.[51] Aiello eventually offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who eliminated secondnameplaceholder.[54][51] At least 10 gunmen tried to collect on Aiello's bounty, but ended up dead.[50] secondnameplaceholder's ally Ralph Sheldon attempted to kill both secondnameplaceholder and Lombardo for Aiello's reward, but secondnameplaceholder henchman Frank Nitti's intelligence network learned of the transaction and had Sheldon shot in front of a West Side hotel, although he did not die.[52]In November 1927, Aiello organized machine-gun ambushes across from Lombardo's home and a cigar store frequented by secondnameplaceholder, but those plans were foiled after an anonymous tip led police to raid several addresses and arrest Milwaukee gunman Angelo La Mantio and four other Aiello gunmen. After the police discovered receipts for the apartments in La Mantio's pockets, he confessed that Aiello had hired him to kill secondnameplaceholder and Lombardo, leading the police to arrest Aiello himself and bring him to the South Clark Street police station.[52][56] Upon learning of the arrest, secondnameplaceholder dispatched nearly two dozen gunmen to stand guard outside the station and await Aiello's release.[52][57] The men made no attempt to conceal their purpose there, and reporters and photographers rushed to the scene to observe Aiello's expected murder.[55]The protagonists of Chicago's politics had long been associated with questionable methods, and even newspaper circulation "wars", but the need for bootleggers to have protection in city hall introduced a far more serious level of violence and graft. secondnameplaceholder is generally seen as having an appreciable effect in bringing about the victories of Republican William Hale Thompson, especially in the 1927 mayoral race when Thompson campaigned for a wide-open town, at one time hinting that he'd reopen illegal saloons.[58] Such a proclamation helped his campaign gain the support of secondnameplaceholder, and he allegedly accepted a contribution of $250,000 from the gangster. In the 1927 mayoral race, Thompson beat William Emmett Dever by a relatively slim margin.[59][60] Thompson's powerful Cook County political machine had drawn on the often-parochial Italian community, but this was in tension with his highly successful courting of African Americans.[61][62][63]Another politician, Joe Esposito, became a political rival of secondnameplaceholder, and on March 21, 1928, Esposito was killed in a drive-by shooting in front of his house.[26] secondnameplaceholder continued to back Thompson. Voting booths were targeted by secondnameplaceholder's bomber James Belcastro in the wards where Thompson's opponents were thought to have support, on the polling day of April 10, 1928, in the so-called Pineapple Primary, causing the deaths of at least 15 people. Belcastro was accused of the murder of lawyer Octavius Granady, an African American who challenged Thompson's candidate for the African American vote, and was chased through the streets on polling day by cars of gunmen before being shot dead. Four policemen were among those charged along with Belcastro, but all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted their statements. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to secondnameplaceholder's organization came in 1931 when Belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Belcastro was an independent operator.[64][65][66][67][68]A 1929 report by The New York Times connected secondnameplaceholder to the 1926 murder of Assistant State Attorney William H. McSwiggin, the 1928 murders of chief investigator Ben Newmark and former mentor Frankie Yale.[69]secondnameplaceholder was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, despite being at his Florida home at the time of the massacre.[70] The massacre was an attempt to eliminate Bugs Moran, head of the North Side Gang, and the motivation for the plan may have been the fact that some expensive whisky illegally imported from Canada via the Detroit River had been hijacked while it was being transported to Cook County, Illinois.[71]Moran was the last survivor of the North Side gunmen; his succession had come about because his similarly aggressive predecessors, Weiss and Vincent Drucci, had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of original leader, Dean O'Banion.[72][73]To monitor their targets' habits and movements, secondnameplaceholder's men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse and garage at 2122 North Clark Street, which served as Moran's headquarters. On the morning of Thursday, February 14, 1929,[74][75] secondnameplaceholder's lookouts signaled four gunmen disguised as police officers to initiate a "police raid". The faux police lined the seven victims along a wall and signaled for accomplices armed with machine guns and shotguns. Moran was not among the victims. Photos of the slain victims shocked the public and damaged secondnameplaceholder's image. Within days, secondnameplaceholder received a summons to testify before a Chicago grand jury on charges of federal Prohibition violations, but he claimed to be too unwell to attend.[76] In an effort to clean up his image, secondnameplaceholder donated to charities and sponsored a soup kitchen in Chicago during the Depression.[77][2]The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre led to public disquiet about Thompson's alliance with secondnameplaceholder and was a factor in Anton J. Cermak winning the mayoral election on April 6, 1931.[78]secondnameplaceholder was primarily known for ordering other men to do his dirty work for him. In May 1929, one of secondnameplaceholder's bodyguards, Frank Rio, uncovered a plot by three of his men, firstnameplaceholderbert Anselmi, John Scalise and Joseph Giunta persuaded by Aiello, to depose secondnameplaceholder and take over the Chicago Outfit.[79] secondnameplaceholder later beat the men with a baseball bat and then ordered his bodyguards to shoot them, a scene that was included in the 1987 film The Untouchables.[80] Deirdre Bair, along with writers and historians such as William Elliot Hazelgrove, have questioned the veracity of the claim.[80][81] Bair questioned why "three trained killers could sit quietly and let this happen", while Hazelgrove stated that secondnameplaceholder would have been "hard pressed to beat three men to death with a baseball bat" and that he would have instead let an enforcer perform the murders.[80][81] However, despite claims that the story was first reported by author Walter Noble Burns in his 1931 book The One-way Ride: The red trail of Chicago gangland from prohibition to Jake Lingle,[80] secondnameplaceholder biographers Max firstnameplaceholderlan Collins and A. Brad Schwartz have found versions of the story in press coverage shortly after the crime. Collins and Schwartz suggest that similarities among reported versions of the story indicate a basis in truth and that the Outfit deliberately spread the tale to enhance secondnameplaceholder's fearsome reputation.[82]:xvi, 209–213, 565 George Meyer, an associate of secondnameplaceholder's, also claimed to have witnessed both the planning of the murders and the event itself.[3]In 1930, upon learning of Aiello's continued plotting against him, secondnameplaceholder resolved to finally eliminate him.[54] In the weeks before Aiello's death secondnameplaceholder's men tracked him to Rochester, New York, where he had connections through Buffalo crime family boss Stefano Magaddino, and plotted to kill him there, but Aiello returned to Chicago before the plot could be executed.[83] Aiello, angst-ridden from the constant need to hide out and the killings of several of his men,[84] set up residence in the Chicago apartment of Unione Siciliana treasurer Pasquale "Patsy Presto" Prestogiacomo at 205 N. Kolmar Ave.[54][85] On October 23, upon exiting Prestogiacomo's building to enter a taxicab, a gunman in a second-floor window across the street started firing at Aiello with a submachine gun.[54][85] Aiello was said to have been shot at least 13 times before he toppled off the building steps and moved around the corner,[86] attempting to move out of the line of fire. Instead, he moved directly into the range of a second submachine gun positioned on the third floor of another apartment block, and was subsequently gunned down.[54][85]In the wake of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, Walter A. Strong, publisher of the Chicago Daily News, decided to ask his friend President Herbert Hoover for federal intervention to stem Chicago's lawlessness. He arranged a secret meeting at the White House, just two weeks after Hoover's inauguration. On March 19, 1929, Strong, joined by Frank Loesch of the Chicago Crime Commission, and Laird Bell, made their case to the President.[87] In Hoover's 1952 Memoir, the former President reported that Strong argued "Chicago was in the hands of the gangsters, that the police and magistrates were completely under their control, …that the Federal government was the only force by which the city’s ability to govern itself could be restored. At once I directed that all the Federal agencies concentrate upon Mr. secondnameplaceholder and his allies."[88]That meeting launched a multi-agency attack on secondnameplaceholder. Treasury and Justice Departments developed plans for income tax prosecutions against Chicago gangsters, and a small, elite squad of Prohibition Bureau agents (whose members included Eliot Ness) were deployed against bootleggers. In a city used to corruption, these lawmen were incorruptible. Charles Schwarz, a writer for the Chicago Daily News, dubbed them Untouchables. To support Federal efforts, Strong secretly used his newspaper's resources to gather and share intelligence on the secondnameplaceholder outfit.[89]On March 27, 1929, secondnameplaceholder was arrested by FBI agents as he left a Chicago courtroom after testifying to a grand jury that was investigating violations of federal prohibition laws. He was charged with contempt of court for feigning illness to avoid an earlier appearance.[90] On May 16, 1929, secondnameplaceholder was arrested in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for carrying a concealed weapon. On May 17, 1929, secondnameplaceholder was indicted by a grand jury and a trial was held before Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge John E Walsh. Following the entering of a guilty plea by his attorney, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to a prison term of one year.[91] On August 8, 1929, secondnameplaceholder was transferred to Philadelphia's Eastern State Penitentiary. A week after his release in March 1930, secondnameplaceholder was listed as the number one "Public Enemy" on the unofficial Chicago Crime Commission's widely publicized list.[92]In April 1930, secondnameplaceholder was arrested on vagrancy charges when visiting Miami Beach; the governor had ordered sheriffs to run him out of the state. secondnameplaceholder claimed that Miami police had refused him food and water and threatened to arrest his family. He was charged with perjury for making these statements, but was acquitted after a three-day trial in July.[93] In September, a Chicago judge issued a warrant for secondnameplaceholder's arrest on charges of vagrancy and then used the publicity to run against Thompson in the Republican primary.[94][95] In February 1931, secondnameplaceholder was tried on the contempt of court charge. In court, Judge James Herbert Wilkerson intervened to reinforce questioning of secondnameplaceholder's doctor by the prosecutor. Wilkerson sentenced secondnameplaceholder to six months, but he remained free while on appeal of the contempt conviction.[96][97]In February 1930, secondnameplaceholder's organization was linked to the murder of Julius Rosenheim, who served as a police informant in the Chicago Outfit for 20 years.[98]Assistant Attorney General Mabel Walker Willebrandt recognized that mob figures publicly led lavish lifestyles yet never filed tax returns, and thus could be convicted of tax evasion without requiring hard evidence to get testimony about their other crimes. She tested this approach by prosecuting a South Carolina bootlegger, Manley Sullivan.[99] In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Sullivan that the approach was legally sound: illegally earned income was subject to income tax; Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. rejected the argument that the Fifth Amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income.[100]The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to investigate secondnameplaceholder, with the focus on his spending. The key to secondnameplaceholder's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided.[101] secondnameplaceholder ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that secondnameplaceholder was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for secondnameplaceholder conceding his large taxable income for certain years. On March 13, 1931, secondnameplaceholder was charged with income tax evasion for 1924, in a secret grand jury. On June 5, 1931, secondnameplaceholder was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 counts of income tax evasion from 1925 through 1929; he was released on $50,000 bail.[102] A week later, Eliot Ness and his team of Untouchables inflicted major financial damage on secondnameplaceholder's operations and led to his indictment on 5,000 violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition laws).[82]:385–421, 493–496[103][102]On June 16, 1931, at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Wilkerson, secondnameplaceholder pleaded guilty to income tax evasion and the 5,000 Volstead Act violations as part of a 2+1⁄2-year prison sentence plea bargain. However, on July 30, 1931, Wilkerson refused to honor the plea bargain, and secondnameplaceholder's counsel rescinded the guilty pleas.[102] On the second day of the trial, Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for secondnameplaceholder.[104][105][106] Wilkerson later tried secondnameplaceholder only on the income tax evasion charges as he determined they took precedence over the Volstead Act charges.[102]Much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers, but these strongly implied secondnameplaceholder's control rather than stating it. secondnameplaceholder's lawyers, who had relied on the plea bargain Wilkerson refused to honor and therefore had mere hours to prepare for the trial, ran a weak defense focused on claiming that essentially all his income was lost to gambling.[107] This would have been irrelevant regardless, since gambling losses can only be subtracted from gambling winnings, but it was further undercut by secondnameplaceholder's expenses, which were well beyond what his claimed income could support; Wilkerson allowed secondnameplaceholder's spending to be presented at very great length.[107] The government charged secondnameplaceholder with evasion of $215,000 in taxes on a total income of $1,038,654, during the five-year period.[102] secondnameplaceholder was convicted on five counts of income tax evasion on October 17, 1931,[108][109][110] and was sentenced a week later to 11 years in federal prison, fined $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000 plus interest due on his back taxes.[111][112][113][114] The contempt of court sentence was served concurrently.[115][116][117] New lawyers hired to represent secondnameplaceholder were Washington-based tax experts. They filed a writ of habeas corpus based on a Supreme Court ruling that tax evasion was not fraud, which apparently meant that secondnameplaceholder had been convicted on charges relating to years that were actually outside the time limit for prosecution. However, a judge interpreted the law so that the time that secondnameplaceholder had spent in Miami was subtracted from the age of the offences, thereby denying the appeal of both secondnameplaceholder's conviction and sentence.[118]secondnameplaceholder was sent to Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary in May 1932, aged 33. Upon his arrival at Atlanta, secondnameplaceholder was officially diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhoea. He was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, the use of which had perforated his nasal septum. secondnameplaceholder was competent at his prison job of stitching soles on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent. He was seen as a weak personality, and so out of his depth dealing with bullying fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict Red Rudensky, feared that secondnameplaceholder would have a breakdown. Rudensky was formerly a small-time criminal associated with the secondnameplaceholder gang and found himself becoming a protector for secondnameplaceholder. The conspicuous protection of Rudensky and other prisoners drew accusations from less friendly inmates and fueled suspicion that secondnameplaceholder was receiving special treatment. No solid evidence ever emerged, but it formed part of the rationale for moving secondnameplaceholder to the recently opened firstnameplaceholdercatraz Federal Penitentiary off the coast of San Francisco, in August 1934.[119] On June 23, 1936, secondnameplaceholder was stabbed and superficially wounded by fellow-firstnameplaceholdercatraz inmate James C. Lucas.[120]Due to his good behavior, secondnameplaceholder was permitted to play banjo in the firstnameplaceholdercatraz prison band, the Rock Islanders, which gave regular Sunday concerts for other inmates.[121] secondnameplaceholder also transcribed the song “Madonna Mia” creating his own arrangement as a tribute to his wife Mae.[122]At firstnameplaceholdercatraz, secondnameplaceholder's decline became increasingly evident, as neurosyphilis progressively eroded his mental faculties; his formal diagnosis of syphilis of the brain was made in February 1938.[123] He spent the last year of his firstnameplaceholdercatraz sentence in the hospital section, confused and disoriented.[124] secondnameplaceholder completed his term in firstnameplaceholdercatraz on January 6, 1939, and was transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution at Terminal Island in California to serve out his sentence for contempt of court.[125] He was paroled on November 16, 1939, after his wife Mae appealed to the court, based on his reduced mental capabilities.[126][127]
<h2>Chicago aftermath</h2>
The main effect of secondnameplaceholder's conviction was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but those involved in the jailing of secondnameplaceholder portrayed it as considerably undermining the city's organized crime syndicate. secondnameplaceholder's underboss, Frank Nitti, took over as boss of the Outfit after he was released from prison in March 1932, having also been convicted of tax evasion charges.[128] Far from being smashed, the Outfit continued without being troubled by the Chicago police, but at a lower level and without the open violence that had marked secondnameplaceholder's rule. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once Prohibition was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing secondnameplaceholder's notoriety bring him down, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead "front boss".[82]:468–469, 517–518, 524–527, 538–541[78] Prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 1950s, FBI agents discovered an organization led by secondnameplaceholder's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld.[129]Some historians have speculated that secondnameplaceholder ordered the 1939 murder of Edward J. O'Hare a week before his release, for helping federal prosecutors convict secondnameplaceholder of tax evasion, though there are other theories for O'Hare's death.[130]
<h2>Failing health and death</h2>
Due to his failing health, secondnameplaceholder was released from prison on November 16, 1939,[131] and referred to the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for the treatment of paresis (caused by late-stage syphilis). Hopkins refused to admit him on his reputation alone, but Union Memorial Hospital accepted him. secondnameplaceholder was grateful for the compassionate care that he received and donated two Japanese weeping cherry trees to Union Memorial Hospital in 1939. A very sickly secondnameplaceholder left Baltimore on March 20, 1940, after a few weeks of inpatient and outpatient care, for Palm Island, Florida.[132][133][134] In 1942, after mass production of penicillin was started in the United States, secondnameplaceholder was one of the first American patients treated by the new drug.[135] Though it was too late for him to reverse the damage in his brain, it did slow down the progression of the disease.[126]In 1946, his physician and a Baltimore psychiatrist examined him and concluded that secondnameplaceholder had the mentality of a 12-year-old child.[90] secondnameplaceholder spent the last years of his life at his mansion in Palm Island, Florida, spending time with his wife and grandchildren.[136] On January 21, 1947, secondnameplaceholder had a stroke. He regained consciousness and started to improve, but contracted bronchopneumonia. He suffered a cardiac arrest on January 22, and on January 25, surrounded by his family in his home, secondnameplaceholder died after his heart failed as a result of apoplexy.[137][138] His body was transported back to Chicago a week later and a private funeral was held.[139] He was originally buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Chicago. In 1950, secondnameplaceholder's remains, along with those of his father, Gabriele, and brother, Salvatore, were moved to Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.[140][141]
<h2>In popular culture</h2>
secondnameplaceholder is one of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20th century and has been the major subject of numerous articles, books, and films. Particularly, from 1925 to 1929, shortly after secondnameplaceholder relocated to Chicago, he enjoyed status as the most notorious mobster in the country. secondnameplaceholder cultivated a certain image of himself in the media, that made him a subject of fascination.[142][143] His personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal masterminds ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a pinstriped suit and tilted fedora are based on photos of secondnameplaceholder. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and parodies of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder Romanovich secondnameplaceholder (Russian: Андре́й Рома́нович Чикати́ло, romanized: Andréj Románovič Čikatílo; Ukrainian: Андрій Романович Чикатило, romanized: Andrij Romanovyč Čykatylo; 16 October 1936 – 14 February 1994) was a Soviet serial killer, nicknamed the Butcher of Rostov, the Red Ripper, and the Rostov Ripper, who sexually assaulted, murdered, and mutilated at least fifty-two women and children between 1978 and 1990 in the Russian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, and the Uzbek SSR. secondnameplaceholder confessed to fifty-six murders, fifty-three for which he was tried in April 1992. He was convicted and sentenced to death for fifty-two murders in October 1992, although the Supreme Court of Russia ruled in 1993 that insufficient evidence existed to prove his guilt in nine of those killings. secondnameplaceholder was subsequently executed in February 1994.secondnameplaceholder was known as the "Rostov Ripper" and the "Butcher of Rostov" because he committed most of his murders in the Rostov Oblast of the Russian SFSR.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on 16 October 1936 in the village of Yabluchne in the Sumy Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR. At the time of his birth, Ukraine was in the grip of a famine caused by Joseph Stalin's forced collectivization of agriculture.[5][6] secondnameplaceholder's parents were both collective farm labourers who lived in a one-room hut.[7] They received no wages for their work, but instead received the right to cultivate a plot of land behind the family hut.[8]The family seldom had sufficient food; secondnameplaceholder himself later claimed not to have eaten bread until the age of 12,[9] adding that he and his family often had to eat grass and leaves in an effort to stave off hunger.[10] Throughout his childhood, secondnameplaceholder was repeatedly told by his mother Anna that prior to his birth, an older brother of his named Stepan had, at the age of four, been kidnapped and cannibalized by starving neighbours, although it has never been established whether this incident actually occurred, or if a Stepan secondnameplaceholder even existed.[11][5] Nonetheless, secondnameplaceholder recalled his childhood as being blighted by poverty, ridicule, hunger, and war.[11]When the Soviet Union entered the Second World War, secondnameplaceholder's father Roman was conscripted into the Red Army. He would later be taken prisoner after being wounded in combat.[12] Between 1941 and 1944, secondnameplaceholder witnessed some of the effects of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, which he described as "horrors", adding he witnessed bombings, fires, and shootings from which he and his mother would hide in cellars and ditches.[13] On one occasion, secondnameplaceholder and his mother were forced to watch their own hut burn to the ground.[14] With his father at war, secondnameplaceholder and his mother shared a single bed. He was a chronic bed wetter, and his mother berated and beat him for each offence.[15]In 1943 secondnameplaceholder's mother gave birth to a baby girl, Tatyana. Because secondnameplaceholder's father had been conscripted in 1941, he could not have fathered this child. As many Ukrainian women were raped by German soldiers during the war, it has been speculated Tatyana was conceived as a result of a rape committed by a German soldier. As secondnameplaceholder and his mother lived in a one-room hut, this rape may have been committed in secondnameplaceholder's presence.[16]In September 1944,[10] secondnameplaceholder began his schooling. Although shy and ardently studious as a child, he was physically weak and regularly attended school in homespun clothing and, by 1946, with his stomach swollen from hunger resulting from the post-war famine which plagued much of the Soviet Union.[10] On several occasions, this hunger caused secondnameplaceholder to faint both at home and at school,[14] and he was consistently targeted by bullies[17] who regularly mocked him over his physical stature and timid nature. At home, secondnameplaceholder and his sister were constantly berated by their mother. Tatyana later recalled that in spite of the hardships endured by her parents, their father was a kind man, whereas their mother was harsh and unforgiving toward her children.[15]secondnameplaceholder developed a passion for reading and memorizing data, and often studied at home, both to increase his sense of self-worth and to compensate for his myopia which often prevented him from reading the classroom blackboard.[18] To his teachers, secondnameplaceholder was an excellent student upon whom they would regularly bestow praise and commendation.By his teens, secondnameplaceholder was both a model student and an ardent communist. He was appointed editor of his school newspaper at age 14[19] and chairman of the pupils' Communist Party committee two years later. An avid reader of communist literature, he was also delegated the task of organizing street marches.[20] Although secondnameplaceholder claimed learning did not come easy to him due to headaches and a poor memory, he was the only student from his collective farm to complete the final year of study, graduating with excellent grades in 1954.[20]At the onset of puberty, secondnameplaceholder discovered that he suffered from chronic impotence, worsening his social awkwardness and self-hatred.[21] He was shy in the company of women;[22] his first crush, at age 17, had been on a girl named Lilya Barysheva, with whom he had become acquainted through his school newspaper,[23] yet he was chronically nervous in her company and never asked her for a date. The same year, secondnameplaceholder jumped upon an 11-year-old friend of his younger sister and wrestled her to the ground, ejaculating as the girl struggled in his grasp.[24]Following his graduation, secondnameplaceholder applied for a scholarship at Moscow State University. Although he passed the entrance examination with good-to-excellent scores,[25] his grades were not deemed good enough for acceptance.[25] secondnameplaceholder speculated his scholarship application was rejected due to his father's tainted war record (his father had been branded a traitor for being taken prisoner in 1943)[11][18] but the truth was that other students had performed better in a highly competitive exam.[26] He did not attempt to enroll at another university; instead, he travelled to the city of Kursk, where he worked as a labourer for three months before—in 1955—enrolling in a vocational school with the aim of becoming a communications technician.[25] The same year, secondnameplaceholder formed his first serious relationship, with a local girl two years his junior. On three occasions, the couple attempted intercourse, although on each occasion, secondnameplaceholder was unable to sustain an erection.[27] After eighteen months, she broke off the relationship.Upon completion of his two-year vocational training, secondnameplaceholder relocated to the Urals city of Nizhny Tagil[28] to work upon a long-term construction project. While living in Nizhny Tagil, he also undertook correspondence courses in engineering with the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute of Communication. He worked in the Urals for two years until he was drafted into the Soviet Army in 1957.secondnameplaceholder performed his compulsory military service between 1957 and 1960,[29] assigned first to serve with border guards in Central Asia, then to a KGB communications unit in East Berlin. Here, his work record was unblemished, and he joined the Communist Party shortly before his military service ended in 1960.[30]Upon completing his service, secondnameplaceholder returned to his native village to live with his parents. He soon became acquainted with a young divorcée. Their three-month relationship ended after several unsuccessful attempts at intercourse, after which the woman innocently asked her friends for advice as to how secondnameplaceholder might overcome his inability to maintain an erection.[31] As a result, most of his peers discovered his impotence. In a 1993 interview regarding this incident, secondnameplaceholder stated: "Girls were going behind my back, whispering that I was impotent. I was so ashamed. I tried to hang myself. My mother and some young neighbours pulled me out of the noose. Well, I thought no one would want such a shamed man. So I had to run away from there, away from my homeland."[31]
<h2>Move to Rostov-on-Don</h2>
After several months, secondnameplaceholder found a job as a communications engineer in a town located north of Rostov-on-Don. He relocated to the Russian SFSR in 1961, renting a small apartment close to his workplace. The same year, his younger sister, Tatyana, finished her schooling and moved into his apartment (his parents would relocate to the Rostov region shortly thereafter).[32] Tatyana lived with her brother for six months before marrying a local youth and moving into her in-laws' home; she noted nothing untoward with regard to her brother's lifestyle beyond his chronic shyness around women, and resolved to help her brother find a wife and start a family.[33]In 1963 secondnameplaceholder married a woman named Feodosia Odnacheva, to whom he had been introduced by his younger sister. According to secondnameplaceholder, although he was attracted to Feodosia, his marriage was effectively an arranged one which occurred barely two weeks after they had met and in which the decisive roles were played by his sister and her husband.[34]secondnameplaceholder later claimed that his marital sex life was minimal and that, after his wife understood he was unable to maintain an erection, they agreed she would conceive by him ejaculating externally and pushing his semen inside her vagina with his fingers.[35] In 1965, Feodosia gave birth to a daughter, Lyudmila. Four years later, in 1969, a son named Yuri was born.[34]
<h2>Teaching career</h2>
secondnameplaceholder chose to enroll as a correspondence student at Rostov University in 1964,[36] studying Russian literature and philology;[37] he obtained his degree in these subjects in 1970. Shortly before obtaining his degree, secondnameplaceholder obtained a job managing regional sports activities.[38] He remained in this position for one year, before beginning his career as a teacher of Russian language and literature in Novoshakhtinsk.[39]secondnameplaceholder was largely ineffective as a teacher; although knowledgeable in the subjects he taught, he was seldom able to maintain discipline in his classes and was regularly subjected to mockery by his students who, he claimed, took advantage of his modest nature.[41]In May 1973, secondnameplaceholder committed his first known sexual assault upon one of his pupils. In this incident, he swam towards a 15-year-old girl and groped her breasts and genitals, ejaculating as the girl struggled against his grasp. Months later, secondnameplaceholder sexually assaulted another teenage girl whom he had locked in his classroom.[42] He was not disciplined for either of these incidents,[43] nor for the occasions in which fellow teachers observed secondnameplaceholder fondling himself in the presence of his students. One of secondnameplaceholder's duties at this school was ensuring his students who boarded at the school were present in their dormitories in the evenings; on several occasions, he is known to have entered the girls' dormitory in the hope of seeing them undressed.[44]In response to the increasing number of complaints lodged against him by pupils, the director of the school summoned secondnameplaceholder to a formal meeting and informed him he should either resign voluntarily or be fired. secondnameplaceholder left his employment discreetly and found another job as a teacher at another school in Novoshakhtinsk in January 1974. He lost this job as a result of staff cutbacks in September 1978, before finding another teaching position in Shakhty, a coal-mining town forty-seven miles north of Rostov-on-Don.[45]secondnameplaceholder's career as a teacher ended in March 1981 following several complaints of child molestation against pupils of both sexes.[46] The same month, he began a job as a supply clerk for a factory based in Rostov which produced construction materials.[47] This job required secondnameplaceholder to travel extensively across much of the Soviet Union to either physically purchase the raw materials required to fulfill production quotas, or to negotiate supply contracts.[48]
<h2>Initial murders</h2>
In September 1978, secondnameplaceholder moved to Shakhty, where he committed his first documented murder. On the evening of 22 December, he lured a 9-year-old girl named Yelena Zakotnova to an old house which he had secretly purchased; he attempted to rape her but failed to achieve an erection. When the girl struggled, he choked her and stabbed her three times in the abdomen, ejaculating while stabbing the child. In an interview after his 1990 arrest, secondnameplaceholder later recalled that immediately after stabbing Zakotnova, the girl had "said something very hoarsely", whereupon he strangled her into unconsciousness before throwing her body into the nearby Grushevka River.[49] Her body was found two days later.Numerous pieces of evidence linked secondnameplaceholder to Zakotnova's murder: spots of blood had been found in the snow near the house secondnameplaceholder had purchased; neighbours had noted that secondnameplaceholder had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova's school rucksack had been found upon the opposite bank of the river at the end of the street (indicating the girl had been thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling secondnameplaceholder, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the girl had last been seen alive.[50] Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko (who had previously served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl)[51] was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko's home revealed spots of blood on his wife's jumper: the blood type was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko's wife.Kravchenko had a watertight alibi for the afternoon of 22 December 1978: he had been at home with his wife and a friend of hers the entire afternoon, and neighbours of the couple were able to verify this.[52] Nonetheless, the police, having threatened Kravchenko's wife with being an accomplice to murder and her friend with perjury, obtained new statements in which the women claimed Kravchenko had not returned home until late in the evening on the day of the murder.[53] Confronted with these altered testimonies, Kravchenko confessed to the killing.[53] He was tried for the murder in 1979. At his trial, Kravchenko retracted his confession and maintained his innocence, stating his confession had been obtained under extreme duress. Despite his retraction, Kravchenko was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death.[54] This sentence was commuted to fifteen years' imprisonment (the maximum possible length of imprisonment at the time) by the Supreme Court in December 1980.[55] Under pressure from the victim's relatives, Kravchenko was retried, erroneously convicted, and eventually executed by firing squad for Zakotnova's murder in July 1983.[56][57]Following Zakotnova's murder, secondnameplaceholder was able to achieve sexual arousal and orgasm only through stabbing and slashing women and children to death, and he later claimed that the urge to relive the experience had overwhelmed him. Nonetheless, secondnameplaceholder did stress that, initially, he had struggled to resist these urges, often cutting short business trips to return home rather than face the temptation to search for a victim.[58]On 3 September 1981, secondnameplaceholder encountered a 17-year-old boarding school student, Larisa Tkachenko, standing at a bus stop as he exited a public library in Rostov city centre. According to his subsequent confession, secondnameplaceholder lured Tkachenko to a forest near the Don River with the pretext of drinking vodka and "relaxing".[59] When they reached a secluded area, he threw the girl to the ground before tearing off her clothes and attempting intercourse, as Tkachenko remonstrated against his actions.[60] When secondnameplaceholder failed to achieve an erection, he forced mud inside her mouth to stifle her screams before battering and strangling her to death. As he had no knife, secondnameplaceholder mutilated the body with his teeth and a stick;[15] he also tore one nipple from Tkachenko's body with his teeth before loosely covering her body with leaves, branches, and torn pages of newspaper.[61] Tkachenko's body was found the following day.Nine months after the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, secondnameplaceholder travelled by bus to the Bagayevsky District of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses in the village of Donskoi, he decided to continue his journey on foot.[63] Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, Lyubov Biryuk, who was walking home from a shopping trip.[64] The two walked together for approximately a quarter of a mile until their path was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes,[65] whereupon secondnameplaceholder pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death as he imitated performing intercourse.[66] When her body was found on 27 June, the medical examiner discovered evidence of twenty-two knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region.[67] Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's eye sockets.Following Biryuk's murder, secondnameplaceholder no longer attempted to resist his homicidal urges: between July and September 1982, he killed a further five victims between the ages of 9 and 18. He established a pattern of approaching children, runaways, and young vagrants at bus or railway stations, enticing them to a nearby forest or other secluded area, and killing them, usually by stabbing, slashing and eviscerating the victim with a knife; although some victims, in addition to receiving a multitude of knife wounds, were also strangled or battered to death.[68][69]Many of the victims' bodies bore evidence of mutilation to the eye sockets. Pathologists concluded these injuries had been caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out the eyes of his victims.[71] secondnameplaceholder's adult female victims were often prostitutes or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. He would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. secondnameplaceholder's child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; he would lure these victims to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim,[72] such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut,[73] a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or loam into the victims' mouths to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them.[74] After the killing, secondnameplaceholder would make rudimentary—though seldom serious—efforts to conceal the body[75] before leaving the crime scene.On 11 December 1982 secondnameplaceholder encountered a 10-year-old girl named Olga Stalmachenok riding a bus to her parents' home in Novoshakhtinsk and persuaded the child to leave the bus with him. She was last seen by a fellow passenger, who reported that a middle-aged man had led the girl away firmly by the hand.[76] secondnameplaceholder lured the girl to a cornfield on the outskirts of the city, stabbed her in excess of fifty times around the head and body, ripped open her chest and excised her lower bowel and uterus.[71]By January 1983, four victims thus far killed had been tentatively linked to the same killer.[77] A Moscow police team, headed by Major Mikhail Fetisov, was sent to Rostov-on-Don to direct the investigation, which gradually became known among investigators as Operation Forest Path.[78] Fetisov established a team of ten investigators based in Rostov, charged with solving all four cases. In March, Fetisov assigned a newly appointed specialist forensic analyst, Viktor Burakov, to head the investigation. The following month, Stalmachenok's body was found. Burakov was summoned to the crime scene, where he examined the numerous knife wounds and eviscerations conducted upon the child and the striations on her eye sockets. Burakov later stated that, as he noted the striations upon Stalmachenok's eye sockets, any doubts about the presence of a serial killer evaporated.[79]secondnameplaceholder did not kill again until June 1983, when he murdered a 15-year-old Armenian girl named Laura Sarkisyan; her body was found close to an unmarked railway platform near Shakhty.[80] By September, he had killed a further five victims. The accumulation of bodies found and the similarities between the pattern of wounds inflicted on the victims forced the Soviet authorities to acknowledge that a serial killer was on the loose. On 6 September 1983 the public prosecutor of the Soviet Union formally linked six of the murders thus far attributed to the same killer.[81]Due to the sheer savagery of the murders and the precision of the eviscerations upon the victims' bodies, police theorized that the killings had been conducted by either a group harvesting organs to sell for transplant, the work of a Satanic cult,[82] or a mentally ill individual. Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or paedophilia were checked[83] and logged in a card filing system. Registered sex offenders were also investigated and, if their alibi was corroborated, eliminated from the inquiry.[84]Beginning in September 1983, several young men confessed to the murders, although these individuals were often intellectually disabled youths who admitted to the crimes only under prolonged and often brutal interrogation. Three known homosexuals and a convicted sex offender committed suicide as a result of the investigators' heavy-handed tactics.[85][86] As a result of the investigation, more than 1,000 unrelated crimes, including ninety-five murders,[87] 140 aggravated assaults, and 245 rapes, were solved.[88]However, as police obtained confessions from suspects, bodies continued to be discovered, proving that the suspects who had confessed could not be the killer they were seeking. On 30 October 1983 the eviscerated body of a 19-year-old prostitute, Vera Shevkun, was found in Shakhty.[89] Shevkun had been killed on 27 October. Although the mutilations inflicted upon Shevkun's body were otherwise characteristic of those found upon other victims linked to the unknown murderer, the victim's eyes had not been enucleated or otherwise wounded.[89] Two months later, on 27 December, a 14-year-old Gukovo schoolboy, Sergey Markov, was lured off a train and murdered at a rural station near Novocherkassk.[90] Markov was emasculated and suffered over seventy knife wounds to his neck and upper torso before being eviscerated.[91]In January and February 1984, secondnameplaceholder killed two women in Rostov's Park of Aviators. On 24 March, he lured a 10-year-old boy, Dmitry Ptashnikov, away from a stamp kiosk in Novoshakhtinsk. While walking with the boy, secondnameplaceholder was seen by several witnesses who were able to give investigators a detailed description of the killer. When Ptashnikov's body was found three days later, police also found a footprint of the killer and both semen and saliva samples on the victim's clothing.[92] On 25 May, secondnameplaceholder killed a young woman named Tatyana Petrosyan and her 10-year-old daughter, Svetlana, in a wooded area outside Shakhty; Petrosyan had known secondnameplaceholder for several years prior to her murder.[93] By the end of July, he had killed three additional young women between the ages of 19 and 21, and a 13-year-old boy.[94]In the summer of 1984, secondnameplaceholder was fired from his work as a supply clerk for the theft of two rolls of linoleum. The accusation had been filed against him the previous February, and he had been asked to resign quietly but had refused to do so, as he had denied the charges.[95] secondnameplaceholder found another job as a supply clerk in Rostov on 1 August.[96]On 2 August, secondnameplaceholder killed a 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in the Park of Aviators. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, to the banks of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a shortcut to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered thirty-nine slash wounds to her body before secondnameplaceholder mutilated and disemboweled her, intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal.[97] Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth.[98] Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, secondnameplaceholder flew to the Uzbek capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl, Akmaral Seydaliyeva.[98] Within two weeks, an 11-year-old boy named Aleksandr Chepel had been found on the banks of the Don River, strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, just yards from where Alexeyeva's body had earlier been found.[98] secondnameplaceholder then killed a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, in the Park of Aviators on 6 September.[99]
<h2>First arrest and release</h2>
On 13 September 1984, secondnameplaceholder was observed by two undercover detectives attempting to talk to young women at Rostov bus station. The detectives followed him as he wandered through the city, trying to approach women and committing acts of frotteurism in public places.[100] Upon secondnameplaceholder's arrival at the city's central market he was arrested and held. A search of his belongings revealed a knife with a 20-centimetre (7.9 in) blade, several lengths of rope, and a jar of Vaseline.[101] He was also discovered to be under investigation for minor theft at one of his former employers, which gave the investigators the legal right to hold him for a prolonged period of time. secondnameplaceholder's dubious background was uncovered, and his physical description matched the description of the man seen walking alongside Dmitry Ptashnikov prior to the boy's murder. A sample of secondnameplaceholder's blood was taken; the results of which revealed his blood group to be type A,[102] whereas semen samples found upon a total of six victims murdered by the unknown killer throughout the spring and summer of 1984[103] had been classified by medical examiners to be type AB. secondnameplaceholder's name was added to the card index file used by investigators; however, the results of his blood type analysis largely discounted him as being the unknown killer.[n 1]secondnameplaceholder was found guilty of theft of property from his previous employer[105] and sentenced to one year in prison, but was freed on 12 December 1984 after serving three months.[105]On 8 October 1984 the head of the Russian Public Prosecutors Office formally linked twenty-three of secondnameplaceholder's murders into one case and dropped all charges against the mentally handicapped youths who had previously confessed to the murders.[106]Upon his release from prison in December 1984, secondnameplaceholder found new work at a locomotive factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985[107] when, on a business trip to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, at a railway platform near Domodedovo Airport. Pokhlistova was lured into a thicket of woods where she was bound, stabbed thirty-eight times in her neck and chest, then strangled to death.[108]Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the Rostov Oblast to Moscow via air, investigators checked all Aeroflot flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov region between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, secondnameplaceholder had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, secondnameplaceholder killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.[109]In November 1985, a special procurator, Issa Kostoyev, was appointed to supervise the investigation, which had by this stage expanded to include fifteen procurators and twenty-nine detectives assigned to work exclusively upon the manhunt.[110] The known murders linked to the manhunt were carefully re-investigated, and police began another round of questioning of known sex offenders and homosexuals. The following month, the militsiya resumed the patrolling of railway stations around Rostov, and plain clothed female officers were ordered to loiter around bus and train stations. At the request of Burakov, police also took the step of consulting a psychiatrist, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the first such consultation in a serial killer investigation in the Soviet Union. All crime scene and medical examiner's reports were made available to Bukhanovsky, upon the understanding he would produce a psychological profile of the unknown murderer for investigators.[111]
<h2>Psychological profile</h2>
Bukhanovsky's 65-page psychological profile described the killer as a reclusive man aged between 45 and 50 years old who had endured a painful and isolated childhood, and who was incapable of flirting or courtship with women. This individual was well educated,[112] likely to be married and to have fathered children, but also a sadist who suffered from impotence and could achieve sexual arousal only by seeing his victims suffer. The murders themselves were an analogue to the sexual intercourse this individual was incapable of performing, and his knife became a substitute for a penis which failed to function normally.[113] Because many of the killings had occurred on weekdays near mass transport hubs and across the entire Rostov Oblast, Bukhanovsky also argued that the killer's work required him to travel regularly, and based upon the actual days of the week when the killings had occurred, the killer was most likely tied to a production schedule.[114]secondnameplaceholder followed the investigation carefully, reading newspaper reports about the manhunt for the killer which had begun to appear,[115] and keeping his homicidal urges under control. For almost a year following the August 1985 murder of Gulyaeva, no further victims were found in either the Rostov or Moscow Oblasts whose bodies bore the signature mutilations of the unknown murderer. Investigators did tentatively link the murder of a 33-year-old woman named Lyubov Golovakha—found stabbed to death in the Myasnikovsky District of Rostov on 23 July 1986—to the investigation, although this was solely upon the basis that the killer's semen type matched that of the killer they were seeking, that the victim had been stripped naked prior to her murder, and that she had been stabbed in excess of twenty times.[12] The victim had not been dismembered or otherwise mutilated, nor had she been seen near mass transportation. Because of these discrepancies, many investigators expressed serious doubts as to whether Golovakha's murder had been committed by the killer they were seeking.On 18 August 1986 a victim was found buried in a depression of earth in the grounds of a collective farm in the city of Bataysk. The wounds inflicted on this victim bore the trademark mutilations of victims linked to the manhunt killed between 1982 and 1985. The victim was an 18-year-old secretary named Irina Pogoryelova. Her body had been slit open from the neck to the genitalia, with one breast removed and her eyes cut out. As the murderer had made serious efforts to bury the body,[116] some investigators theorized that this explained the sudden dearth in the number of victims found.By the autumn of 1986, investigators in Rostov theorized that the unknown killer may have moved to another part of the Soviet Union and continued killing there. As the victims killed in the Rostov Oblast in 1985 and 1986 had died in the months of July and August, by the autumn of 1986, some investigators gave credence to the possibility the perpetrator may have relocated to another part of the Soviet Union, and may only be returning to the Rostov Oblast in summer. The Rostov police compiled bulletins to be sent to all forces throughout the Soviet Union, describing the pattern of wounds their unknown killer inflicted upon his victims and requesting feedback from any police force who had discovered murder victims with wounds matching those upon the victims found in the Rostov Oblast. The response was negative.[117][n 2]In 1987 secondnameplaceholder killed three times. On each occasion the murder took place while he was on a business trip far away from the Rostov Oblast, and none of these murders were linked to the manhunt in Rostov.[121] secondnameplaceholder's first murder in 1987 was committed on 16 May, when he encountered a 12-year-old boy, Oleg Makarenkov, at a train station in the Urals town of Revda. Makarenkov was lured from the station with the promise of sharing a meal with secondnameplaceholder at his dacha; he was murdered in woodland close to the station, although his body would remain undiscovered until 1991.[122] In July, he killed a 12-year-old boy, Ivan Bilovetsky, in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhia, and on 15 September, he killed a 16-year-old vocational school student, Yuri Tereshonok, in woodland on the outskirts of Leningrad.[123]
<h2>Definitive resurfacing</h2>
In 1988 secondnameplaceholder killed three times, murdering an unidentified woman in Krasny Sulin in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before secondnameplaceholder bound her hands behind her back and stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose from her face[124] and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. secondnameplaceholder then bludgeoned her to death with a slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete, had not been disemboweled, and her murderer had not wounded her eyes or genitals, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation.[125] In May, secondnameplaceholder killed a 9-year-old boy named Aleksey Voronko in the Ukrainian city of Ilovaisk. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt.[126] On 14 July, secondnameplaceholder killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least thirty knife wounds.[127]secondnameplaceholder did not kill again until 28 February 1989, when he killed a 16-year-old girl, Tatyana Ryzhova, in his daughter's vacant apartment.[n 3] He dismembered her body and hid the remains in a sewer. As the victim had been dismembered, police did not link her murder to the investigation. Between May and August, secondnameplaceholder killed a further four victims, three of whom were killed in Rostov and Shakhty,[126] although only two of these victims were linked to the killer. With the resurfacing of victims definitively linked to the manhunt and the fact the majority of these victims' bodies had been discovered close to railway stations, investigators assigned numerous plain clothed officers to discreetly film and photograph passengers on trains throughout the Rostov Oblast. Several trains were also fitted with hidden cameras with the intention of filming or photographing a victim in the company of his or her murderer.[128]On 14 January 1990, secondnameplaceholder encountered 11-year-old firstnameplaceholder Kravchenko standing outside a Shakhty theater. Kravchenko was lured from the theater on the pretext of being shown imported Western films secondnameplaceholder claimed to have at his residence; his extensively stabbed, emasculated body was found in a secluded section of woodland the following month.[129] Seven weeks after Kravchenko's murder, on 7 March, secondnameplaceholder lured a 10-year-old boy, Yaroslav Makarov, from a Rostov train station to Rostov's Botanical Gardens. His eviscerated body was found the following day.[130]On 11 March, the leaders of the investigation, headed by Fetisov, held a meeting to discuss progress made in the manhunt.[131] Fetisov was under intense pressure from the public, the press, and the Soviet Ministry of the Interior to solve the case; both he and Viktor Burakov had devoted extensive time and effort over the previous seven years in their efforts to apprehend the perpetrator.[n 4] The intensity of the manhunt in the years up to 1984 had receded to a degree between 1985 and 1987, when secondnameplaceholder had committed only three murders investigators had conclusively linked to the killer—all killed by 1986. However, by March 1990, a further six victims had been linked to the killer. In addition, following the introduction of greater media freedom as a result of glasnost, the Soviet news media was much less repressed than it had been in the early years of the manhunt and as such, devoted extensive publicity to the case. Fetisov had also noted laxity in some areas of the investigation and warned that people would be fired if the killer was not caught soon.[133]secondnameplaceholder had killed three further victims by August 1990. On 4 April, he lured a 31-year-old woman, Lyubov Zuyeva, off a train and killed her in woodland near Donleskhoz station. Her body was not found until 24 August.[134] On 28 July, he lured a 13-year-old boy, Viktor Petrov, away from a Rostov railway station and killed him in Rostov's Botanical Gardens;[135] and on 14 August, he killed an 11-year-old boy, Ivan Fomin, in the reeds near Novocherkassk beach.[136]
<h2>Snare</h2>
The discovery of more victims sparked a massive police operation. Because several victims' bodies had been discovered at railway stations on one rail route through the Rostov Oblast,[137] Burakov suggested a plan to saturate all larger stations in the region with an obvious uniformed police presence which the killer could not fail to notice. The intention was to discourage the killer from attempting to strike at any of these locations, and to have undercover agents patrol smaller and less busy stations, where the murderer's activities would be more likely to be noticed. The plan was approved, and both the uniformed and undercover officers were instructed to question any adult man in the company of a young woman or child, and note his name and passport number.[138] Police deployed 360 men at all the stations in the Rostov Oblast, but only undercover officers were posted at the three smallest stations on the route through the oblast where the killer had struck most frequently—Kirpichnaya, Donleskhoz, and Lesostep[139]—in an effort to force the killer to strike at one of those three stations. The operation was implemented on 27 October 1990.[140]On 30 October, police found the body of a 16-year-old boy, Vadim Gromov, at Donleskhoz station. The wounds upon Gromov's body immediately linked his murder to the manhunt: the youth had been strangled, stabbed twenty-seven times and castrated, with the tip of his tongue severed and his left eye stabbed.[141] Gromov had been killed on 17 October, ten days before the start of the initiative. The same day Gromov's body was found, secondnameplaceholder lured another 16-year-old boy, Viktor Tishchenko, off a train at Kirpichnaya station, another station under surveillance from undercover police, and killed him in a nearby forest.[142] Tishchenko's body—bearing forty separate knife wounds—was found on 3 November.[143]On 6 November 1990, secondnameplaceholder killed and mutilated a 22-year-old woman, Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station.[144] Returning to the railway platform, he was observed by an undercover officer named Igor Rybakov,[145] who observed secondnameplaceholder approach a well and wash his hands and face.[145] When he approached the station, Rybakov also noted that secondnameplaceholder's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows; secondnameplaceholder also had a small red smear on his cheek and what appeared to be a severe wound on one of his fingers.[146] To Rybakov, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near Donleskhoz station at that time of year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but secondnameplaceholder was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms.[147] Rybakov stopped secondnameplaceholder and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him.[145] When Rybakov returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station and the possible blood smear observed upon his cheek.[138]On 13 November, Korostik's body was found; she was the thirty-sixth known victim linked to the manhunt. Police summoned the officer in charge of surveillance at Donleskhoz station and examined the reports of all men stopped and questioned in the previous week.[148] Not only was secondnameplaceholder's name among those reports, but it was familiar to several officers involved in the case because he had been questioned in 1984 and had been placed upon a 1987 suspect list compiled and distributed throughout the Soviet Union.[149] After checking with secondnameplaceholder's present and previous employers, investigators were able to place him in various towns and cities at times when several victims linked to the investigation had been murdered.[7] Questioning of former colleagues from secondnameplaceholder's teaching days revealed that he had been forced to resign from two teaching positions due to repeated complaints of lewd behaviour and sexual assault made by his pupils.[150]Police placed secondnameplaceholder under surveillance on 14 November. In several instances, particularly on trains or buses, he was observed approaching lone young women or children and engaging them in conversation. If the woman or child broke off the conversation, secondnameplaceholder would wait a few minutes and then seek another conversation partner.[151] On 20 November, after six days of surveillance, secondnameplaceholder left his house with a large jar, which he had filled with beer at a small kiosk in a local park[152] before he wandered around Novocherkassk, attempting to make contact with children he met on his way. Upon exiting a cafe, secondnameplaceholder was arrested by four plainclothes police officers.[153]
<h2>Second arrest</h2>
Upon his arrest, secondnameplaceholder gave a statement claiming that the police were mistaken, and complained that he had also been arrested in 1984 for the same series of murders.[154] A strip-search of the suspect revealed a further piece of evidence: one of secondnameplaceholder's fingers had a deep flesh wound he had self-treated with iodine. Medical examiners concluded the wound was from a human bite. secondnameplaceholder's penultimate victim, Viktor Tishchenko, was a physically strong youth. At the crime scene, the police had found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a finger bone was later found to be broken and his fingernail had been bitten off, secondnameplaceholder had never sought medical treatment for this injury.[155]A search of secondnameplaceholder's belongings revealed he had been in possession of a folding knife and two lengths of rope. A sample of his blood was taken,[156] and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a police informer, who was instructed to engage secondnameplaceholder in conversation and elicit any information he could from him.[157] The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of secondnameplaceholder began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead secondnameplaceholder to believe that he was a very sick individual in need of medical help. The intention was to give secondnameplaceholder hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by reason of insanity. Police knew their case against secondnameplaceholder was largely circumstantial, and under Soviet law, they had ten days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.On 21 November, the results of secondnameplaceholder's blood test again revealed his blood type to be type A and not type AB. Due to the amount of physical and circumstantial evidence investigators had thus far compiled, which indicated secondnameplaceholder was indeed the murderer they had been pursuing, plus the fact that investigators had deduced the blood type of the murderer they had pursued using semen samples obtained from the clothing and bodies of fourteen of the victims as opposed to actual blood samples, investigators obtained a sample of secondnameplaceholder's semen to test his blood type, the results of which confirmed that secondnameplaceholder's semen was type AB, whereas his blood and saliva were type A.[158][n 5]Throughout the questioning, secondnameplaceholder repeatedly denied that he had committed the murders, although he did confess to molesting several of his pupils during his career as a teacher.[160] He also produced several written essays for Kostoyev which, although evasive regarding the actual murders, did reveal psychological symptoms consistent with those predicted by Dr. Bukhanovsky in the 1985 psychological profile he had written for the investigators. The interrogation tactics used by Kostoyev may also have caused secondnameplaceholder to become defensive; the informer sharing a KGB cell with the suspect reported to police that secondnameplaceholder had informed him that Kostoyev had repeatedly asked him direct questions regarding the mutilations inflicted upon the victims.[158]
<h2>Confession</h2>
On 29 November, at the request of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Bukhanovsky was invited to assist in the questioning of the suspect. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to secondnameplaceholder.[161] Within two hours, secondnameplaceholder burst into tears[162] and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that secondnameplaceholder was ready to confess.[163][n 6]Armed with the handwritten notes Bukhanovsky had prepared, Kostoyev prepared a formal accusation of murder dated 29 November—the eve of the expiration of the ten-day time period during which secondnameplaceholder could legally be held before being charged. The following morning, Kostoyev resumed the interrogation. According to the official protocol, secondnameplaceholder confessed to thirty-four of the thirty-six murders police had linked to him, although he denied two additional murders committed in 1986 the police had initially believed he had committed: one of whom was Lyubov Golovakha,[164] found stabbed to death on 23 July 1986 and whom investigators had had serious doubts about linking to the manhunt; the second was 18-year-old Irina Pogoryelova, found murdered in Bataysk on 18 August 1986 and whose mutilations closely matched those inflicted upon other victims linked to the manhunt.[n 7]secondnameplaceholder gave a full, detailed description of each murder on the list of charges, all of which were consistent with known facts regarding each killing. When prompted, he could draw a rough sketch of various crime scenes, indicating the position of the victim's body and various landmarks in the vicinity of the crime scene. Additional details provided further proof of his guilt: one victim on the list of charges was a 19-year-old student named Anna Lemesheva, whom secondnameplaceholder had killed on 19 July 1984 near Shakhty station. secondnameplaceholder recalled that as he had fought to overpower her, she had stated that a man named "Bars" ("Leopard") would retaliate for his attacking her. Lemesheva's fiancé had the nickname "Bars" tattooed on his hand.[166]In describing his victims, secondnameplaceholder falsely referred to them as "déclassé elements" whom he would lure to secluded areas before killing. In many instances, particularly (though not exclusively) with his male victims, secondnameplaceholder stated he would bind the victims' hands behind their back with a length of rope before he would proceed to kill them. He would typically inflict a multitude of knife wounds upon the victim; initially inflicting shallow knife wounds to the chest area[168] before inflicting deeper stab and slash wounds—usually thirty to fifty in total—before proceeding to eviscerate[169] the victim as he writhed atop his or her body until he achieved orgasm.[170] secondnameplaceholder had, he stated, become adept at avoiding the spurts of blood from his victims' bodies as he inflicted the knife wounds and eviscerations upon them,[171] and would regularly sit or squat beside his victims until their hearts had stopped beating, adding that the victims' "cries, the blood and the agony gave me relaxation and a certain pleasure."[171]When questioned as to why most of his later victims' eyes had been stabbed and/or slashed, but not enucleated as his earlier victims' eyes had been,[172] secondnameplaceholder stated that he had initially believed in an old Russian superstition that the image of a murderer is left imprinted upon the eyes of the victim. However, he stated, in "later years", he had become convinced this was simply an old wives' tale and he had ceased to gouge out the eyes of his victims.[173]secondnameplaceholder also informed Kostoyev he had often tasted the blood of his victims,[174] to which he stated he "felt chills" and "shook all over". He also confessed to tearing at victims' genitalia, lips, nipples and tongues with his teeth.[175] In several instances, secondnameplaceholder would cut or bite off the tongue of his victim as he performed his eviscerations, then—either at or shortly after the point of death—run around the body as he held the tongue aloft in one hand.[176] Although he also admitted that he had chewed upon the excised uterus of his female victims and the testicles of his male victims, he stated he had later discarded these body parts. Nonetheless, secondnameplaceholder did confess to having swallowed the nipples and tongues of some of his victims.[177]On 30 November, secondnameplaceholder was formally charged with each of the thirty-four murders he had confessed to, all of which had been committed between June 1982 and November 1990.[178]Over the following days, secondnameplaceholder confessed to a further twenty-two[7] killings which had not been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast,[118] because the bodies had not been found, or, in the case of Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder.[n 8] As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the initial list of charges, secondnameplaceholder was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. secondnameplaceholder recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field and that he had approached the girl as she sat in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, secondnameplaceholder stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.[179]In December 1990, secondnameplaceholder led police to the body of Aleksey Khobotov,[180] a boy he had confessed to killing in August 1989 and whom he had buried in woodland near a Shakhty cemetery, proving unequivocally that he was the killer.[171] He later led investigators to the bodies of two other victims he had confessed to killing. Three of the fifty-six victims secondnameplaceholder confessed to killing could not be found or identified, but he was charged with killing fifty-three women and children between 1978 and 1990. He was held in the same cell in Rostov where he had been detained on 20 November to await trial.[181]On 20 August 1991,[182] after police had completed their interrogation, including re-enactments of all the murders at each crime scene,[183] secondnameplaceholder was transferred to the Serbsky Institute in Moscow to undergo a 60-day psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial. secondnameplaceholder was analysed by a senior psychiatrist, firstnameplaceholder Tkachenko, who noted that secondnameplaceholder suffered from various physiological problems, which he attributed to prenatal brain damage.[184] Examining secondnameplaceholder's history, Tkachenko observed a "steady but gradual descent into perversion" which had been compounded by biological and environmental factors, with his increasingly extreme acts of homicidal violence ultimately committed to relieve internal tension. Tkachenko concluded on 18 October that although suffering from borderline personality disorder with sadistic features, he was fit to stand trial.[185] In December 1991, details of secondnameplaceholder's arrest and a brief summary of his crimes were released to the newly privatised Russian media by police.[186]
<h2>Trial</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was brought to trial in Rostov on 14 April 1992, charged with fifty-three counts of murder in addition to five charges of sexual assault against minors committed when he had been a teacher.[187] He was tried in Courtroom Number 5 of the Rostov Provincial Court, before Judge Leonid Akubzhanov.[188]secondnameplaceholder's trial was the first major media event of post-Soviet Russia. Shortly after his psychiatric evaluation at the Serbsky Institute, investigators had conducted a press conference in which a full list of secondnameplaceholder's crimes was released to the press, alongside a 1984 identikit of the individual charged, but not the full name or a photograph of the accused. The media first saw secondnameplaceholder on the first day of his trial, as he entered an iron cage specifically constructed in a corner of the courtroom to protect him from attack by the enraged and often hysterical relatives of his victims. In the opening weeks of secondnameplaceholder's trial, the Russian press regularly published exaggerated and often sensationalistic headlines about the murders, referring to secondnameplaceholder being a "cannibal" or a "maniac" and to his physically resembling a shaven-skulled, demonic individual.[n 9]The first two days of the trial were devoted to Judge Akubzhanov reading the long lists of indictments against secondnameplaceholder. Each murder was discussed individually, and on several occasions, relatives present in the courtroom broke down in tears or fainted when details of their relatives' murder were revealed.[190] After reading the indictment, Judge Akubzhanov announced to the journalists present in the courtroom his intention to conduct an open trial, stating: "Let this trial at least teach us something, so that this will never happen anytime or anywhere again."[191] Judge Akubzhanov then asked secondnameplaceholder to stand, identify himself and provide his date and location of birth. secondnameplaceholder complied, although this would prove to be one of the few civil exchanges between the judge and secondnameplaceholder.[192]secondnameplaceholder was initially questioned in detail about each charge upon the indictment. Responding to specific questions regarding the murders, he often gave dismissive replies to questions, particularly when questioned as to the specific nature of the wounds he had inflicted upon his victims and the ruses he had used to entice his victims to the locations where he had killed them. He would become indignant only when accused of stealing personal possessions from the victims, or to his retaining organs excised from the victims missing from the crime scenes. On one occasion, when asked as to his seeming indifference as to the lifestyle and gender of those whom he had killed, secondnameplaceholder replied: "I did not need to look for them. Every step I took, they were there."[193][n 10]In what became a regular (though not continuous) occurrence throughout the trial, Judge Akubzhanov berated secondnameplaceholder as he questioned him in detail as to the charges; ordering him to "shut your mouth", before adding, "You're not crazy!" as secondnameplaceholder's responses to questions deviated into his discussing issues such as the repression his family had endured throughout his childhood, and his claiming that the charges filed against him were false. These verbal exchanges would occur whether secondnameplaceholder was cooperative or uncooperative throughout proceedings, and the manner in which the judge questioned secondnameplaceholder repeatedly led his defence lawyer Marat Khabibulin to protest against the accusatory nature of the court proceedings. In the instances in which secondnameplaceholder was uncooperative throughout questioning, he would simply shout over the judge, denounce the court as a farce, and launch into rambling, disjointed speeches. On occasion, secondnameplaceholder would also expose himself to the court or sing socialist movement anthems throughout proceedings. These antics regularly resulted in his being returned to his cell as court proceedings continued in his absence.[195]On 21 April, secondnameplaceholder's defence lawyer requested that Dr. Bukhanovsky be allowed to testify as to the contents of the 1985 psychological profile he had written, and his subsequent consultations with secondnameplaceholder following his arrest, adding that Bukhanovsky could exert influence over secondnameplaceholder and, by extension, might influence the court proceedings.[196] This request was denied. The same day, secondnameplaceholder began to refuse to answer any questions from the judge, the prosecutor or his own defence lawyer.[197] He refused to answer any questions for three consecutive days[196] before stating his presumption of innocence had been irredeemably violated by the judge and that he intended to give no further testimony.[198] The following day, proceedings were adjourned for two weeks.secondnameplaceholder withdrew his confessions to six of the killings for which he had been charged on 13 May,[165] and also claimed he had killed four further victims who were not included upon the indictment. The same day, his defence lawyer again submitted a request that his client be subjected to a second psychiatric evaluation. This motion was dismissed by the judge as being groundless. In response, Khabibulin rose from his seat, condemning the composition of the court, and arguing that the judge was unfit to continue presiding over the case. secondnameplaceholder himself repeated his earlier remarks as to the judge making numerous rash remarks prejudging his guilt. The prosecutor, Nikolai Gerasimenko, vocally supported the defence's claim, stating that the judge had indeed made too many such comments and had committed numerous procedural violations in his lecturing and insulting the defendant.[199] Gerasimenko further contended that in his conducting an open trial, secondnameplaceholder had already been effectively prejudged as being guilty by the press,[200] before also requesting that the judge be replaced.[201][n 11]On 3 July, Bukhanovsky was permitted to testify as to his analysis of secondnameplaceholder, although solely in the capacity as a witness. For three hours, Bukhanovsky testified as to his 1985 psychological profile of secondnameplaceholder, and of the conversations he had held with secondnameplaceholder following his arrest, which had culminated in secondnameplaceholder's confession. Four psychiatric experts from the Serbsky Institute also testified as to the results of a  behavioral analysis they had conducted on secondnameplaceholder in May, following the initial adjournment of the trial. All testified as to his behaviour in the courtroom being strikingly at contrast to his behaviour in his cell, and that they considered his antics to be a calculated attempt to obtain acquittal on the grounds of insanity.[203]On 9 August, the defence delivered their closing arguments before the judge. Upon beginning his 90-minute closing argument, Khabibulin first stated he had no confidence his voice would be heard above the "general outcry" for retribution against secondnameplaceholder, before questioning the reliability of the forensic evidence presented at the trial and describing areas of secondnameplaceholder's confessions as being "baseless". Khabibulin also questioned the judge's objectivity and harked back to the decision of the court not to allow the defence to present testimony from independent psychiatrists; emphasizing that crimes of this nature could not have been committed by an individual of sane mind. Khabibulin then formally requested the judge find his client not guilty.[204]The following day, prosecutor Anatoly Zadorozhny delivered his closing argument before the judge. Harking towards the earlier testimony of psychiatrists at the trial, Zadorozhny argued that secondnameplaceholder fully understood the criminality of his actions, was able to resist his homicidal impulses, and had made numerous conscious efforts to avoid detection. Moreover, Zadorozhny emphasized that in 19 of the charges, the material evidence of the crimes had been provided by secondnameplaceholder himself. Zadorozhny then recited each of the charges before formally requesting the death penalty.[n 12]Following the conclusion of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited secondnameplaceholder back into the courtroom before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, secondnameplaceholder simply sat mute.[205] Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass the final sentence upon secondnameplaceholder.[206] (This date was later postponed until 14 October.)[207] As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by secondnameplaceholder in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at secondnameplaceholder, hitting him in the chest.[205] When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.[208]On 14 October, the court reconvened to hear formal sentencing (this sentencing would not finish until the following day). Judge Akubzhanov began sentencing by announcing secondnameplaceholder guilty of fifty-two of the fifty-three murders for which he had been tried.[209] He was sentenced to death for each offense. secondnameplaceholder was also found guilty of five counts of sexual assault committed during the years he worked as a teacher in the 1970s. In reciting his findings, the judge read the list of murders again, before criticizing both the police and the prosecutor's department for various mistakes in the investigation which had allowed secondnameplaceholder to remain free until 1990.[210] Particular criticism was directed towards not local police, but the prosecutor's department—primarily procurator Issa Kostoyev—whom Judge Akubzhanov scathed as "negligent", and who had been dismissive of secondnameplaceholder's inclusion upon a 1987 suspect list compiled by police. Akubzhanov also rejected the numerous claims Kostoyev had made to the media in the months prior to the trial that police had deliberately withheld documents pertaining to secondnameplaceholder from the prosecutor's department as being provably baseless, adding that proof existed he had been in possession of all internal bulletins.[211][n 13]On 15 October, Judge Akubzhanov formally sentenced secondnameplaceholder to death plus eighty-six years for the fifty-two murders and five counts of sexual assault for which he had been found guilty. secondnameplaceholder kicked his bench across his cage when he heard the verdict and began shouting abuse.[213] However, when given an opportunity to make a speech in response to the verdict, he again remained silent.[214] Upon passing final sentence, Judge Akubzhanov made the following remark:secondnameplaceholder was taken from the courtroom to his cell at Novocherkassk prison to await execution. He did lodge an appeal against his conviction with the Supreme Court of Russia, but this appeal was rejected in the summer of 1993.[215][n 14]
<h2>Execution</h2>
Following the rejection of his appeal to the Supreme Court, secondnameplaceholder filed a final appeal for clemency with President Boris Yeltsin. This final appeal was rejected on 4 January 1994.[216]On 14 February 1994, secondnameplaceholder was taken from his death row cell to a soundproofed room in Novocherkassk prison and executed with a single gunshot behind the right ear.[217][218] He was buried in an unmarked grave at the prison cemetery.[219]
<h2>Victims</h2>
FootnoteJudge Leonid Akubzhanov cleared secondnameplaceholder of the murder of 15-year-old Laura Sarkisyan at his trial due to insufficient evidence.[246] Sarkisyan, a runaway from Armenia, was last seen by her family on 18 June. In his confessions to police, secondnameplaceholder had stated he had killed an Armenian girl in the early summer of 1983 and that she had been killed in a stretch of woodland located near Kirpichnaya station. Although secondnameplaceholder had been unable to identify Sarkisyan's picture when presented to him, the timing of Sarkisyan's disappearance and secondnameplaceholder's physical description of the victim, her clothing, and where he had killed her did match scattered, partial skeletal remains and personal effects which, although determined as being those of a female in her early- to mid-teens, could not be precisely identified.[247]Although he had at one stage denied having committed six of the murders for which he had been brought to trial, secondnameplaceholder never specifically disputed Sarkisyan as being a victim of his.
<h2>Media</h2>
Four non-fiction books have been written about the case of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder:
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder Phillip secondnameplaceholder (August 31, 1969 – July 23, 1997) was an American spree killer[note 1] known to have murdered five people during a three-month period in mid-1997.[3] His victims include Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace and Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin.[4] secondnameplaceholder died of suicide by gunshot on July 23, 1997.[5]
<h2>Early life and education</h2>
The youngest of four children, firstnameplaceholder Phillip secondnameplaceholder was born August 31, 1969, in National City, California, to Modesto "Pete" secondnameplaceholder, a Filipino-American,[6] and Mary Anne Schillaci (died in 2012), an Italian-American. Modesto was serving in the United States Navy in the Vietnam War at the time of his son's birth. After leaving the Navy, where he had served as a chief petty officer, Modesto worked as a stockbroker.[7]In his youth, secondnameplaceholder lived with his family in National City and attended Bonita Vista Middle School.[8] In 1981, his father enrolled him in The Bishop's School, an independent day school located in the affluent La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego. There secondnameplaceholder met his lifelong best friend Elizabeth "Liz" Cote.
At school, he was remembered as being bright and very talkative, and testing with an IQ of 147.[9]As a teenager, secondnameplaceholder developed a reputation as a prolific liar, given to telling tall tales about his family and personal life. He was adept at changing his appearance according to what he felt was most attractive at a given moment.[7] secondnameplaceholder identified as gay in high school, when he began having liaisons with wealthy older men.[10] He was voted "least likely to be forgotten."[11] After graduating from high school in 1987, secondnameplaceholder enrolled at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), where he majored in American history.[12]In 1988, when secondnameplaceholder was 19, his father deserted his family and moved to the Philippines to evade arrest for embezzlement.[13] That same year, secondnameplaceholder had begun frequenting local gay clubs and restaurants, and his mother, who was deeply religious, learned about his sexual orientation. During an argument, secondnameplaceholder threw his mother against a wall, dislocating her shoulder. Later examination of his behavior indicates that he may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, characterized by a lack of remorse and empathy.[14] In 1989, secondnameplaceholder dropped out of UC San Diego and settled in the Castro District of San Francisco, a center of LGBTQ culture, moving in with friend Liz Cote and her boyfriend, Phil Merrill.[7]
<h2>Adult life</h2>
In San Francisco, secondnameplaceholder continued his practice of befriending wealthy older men, and also reportedly began creating violent pornography.[7] He also socialized in the Hillcrest and La Jolla neighborhoods of San Diego, as well as in Scottsdale, Arizona, "apparently living off the largesse of one wealthy patron or another."[10] secondnameplaceholder is also believed to have been dealing drugs, including prescription opioids, cocaine, and marijuana.[15][16] He used several aliases: firstnameplaceholder DeSilva,[17] Lt. Cmdr. Andy Cummings, Drew Cunningham, and Curt Matthew Demaris.[18]secondnameplaceholder allegedly first met fashion designer Gianni Versace in San Francisco in October 1990,[19] when Versace was in town to be fitted for the costumes he had designed for the San Francisco Opera production of Richard Strauss's opera Capriccio,[20] although Versace's family has always denied that the two men ever met.[16] In December 1995, secondnameplaceholder met David Madson, a Minneapolis architect, in a San Francisco bar. They began a long-distance relationship shortly after, but Madson ended the relationship in the spring of 1996, telling friends he sensed something "shady" about secondnameplaceholder.[16][21] secondnameplaceholder told friends that Madson was the "love of my life".[13]In September 1996, secondnameplaceholder broke up with Norman Blachford, a wealthy older man who had been hosting and financially supporting him.[16] He soon maxed out his credit cards.[11][20] secondnameplaceholder's close friend Jeffrey "Jeff" Trail, a former Navy officer working as a district manager for a propane delivery company in Minneapolis, had told his former roommate Michael Williams that secondnameplaceholder had resumed selling drugs.[22] secondnameplaceholder also was known to regularly consume these drugs, especially methamphetamine.[20]By April 1997, friends reported secondnameplaceholder was abusing painkillers and was drinking alcohol "like there was no tomorrow".[13][16] Later that month, he told friends he was leaving San Diego for Minneapolis to "take care of some business matters" with Trail,[17] who had recently distanced himself from secondnameplaceholder.[23] Trail expected secondnameplaceholder to move to San Francisco upon leaving Minneapolis. Before secondnameplaceholder's visit, Trail told his sister that he "did not want firstnameplaceholder to come."[24] A week before his death, Trail told Williams that he had had a "huge falling out" with secondnameplaceholder and said, "I made a lot of enemies this weekend ... I've got to get out of here. They're going to kill me."[20]On April 24, secondnameplaceholder and four friends attended a going-away party at Hillcrest's California Cuisine, a rare occasion when secondnameplaceholder did not cover the tab.[15] He had reached the credit limit on both his credit cards, and had to ask for a credit extension to afford his plane ticket to Minneapolis.[5] Upon arriving there the next day, secondnameplaceholder stayed with Madson, a mutual friend of his and Trail's, in Madson's loft apartment.[11] That night, secondnameplaceholder and Madson dined at Nye's Restaurant and visited The Gay 90's nightclub.[24] On April 26, secondnameplaceholder stayed in Trail's apartment while Trail was out of town with his boyfriend, Jon Hackett. The following afternoon, Trail told Hackett that he needed to have a "pretty important" conversation with secondnameplaceholder. When Trail and Hackett later returned to the apartment, there was no sign of secondnameplaceholder or his belongings. Trail left his apartment to see secondnameplaceholder shortly after 9 p.m. and was likely let into Madson's apartment at 9:45 p.m.[16]
<h2>Murders</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's killings began in Minneapolis on April 27, 1997, with the murder of his close friend, 28-year-old Jeffrey Trail. After an argument in Trail's apartment, secondnameplaceholder stole Trail's gun and brought it to second victim David Madson's apartment. secondnameplaceholder rang Trail from Madson's apartment to come and retrieve his gun. On arrival secondnameplaceholder beat Trail to death with a hammer in front of Madson.[5] On April 29, one of Madson's coworkers, concerned about his absence from work, visited his apartment to check on him. They discovered Trail's body rolled in a rug and placed behind a sofa.[16] Trail's watch had stopped at 9:55 p.m., believed by authorities to be the time of the killing.[24]33-year-old Madson was secondnameplaceholder's second victim. Authorities believe Madson remained in his apartment with secondnameplaceholder two days after Trail's murder, as one neighbor witnessed both men in the apartment elevator on April 28, and another neighbor witnessed the pair walking Madson's dog on April 29.[5][16] Investigators initially treated Madson as a suspect in Trail's murder, but Madson's family insisted he was held hostage by secondnameplaceholder. On May 2, Madson and secondnameplaceholder were seen north of Minneapolis, driving in Madson's Jeep and eating lunch together in a bar.[21] The following morning, Madson's body was found on the east shore of Rush Lake near Rush City, Minnesota, with gunshot wounds to the head and back from a .40-caliber Taurus PT100 semi-automatic pistol secondnameplaceholder had taken from Trail's home.[14][25][26]On May 4, secondnameplaceholder drove to Chicago, Illinois, and killed 72-year-old Lee Miglin, a prominent real estate developer. He bound Miglin's hands and feet and wrapped his head with duct tape, then stabbed Miglin more than twenty times with a screwdriver, slit his throat with a hacksaw, and stole his car.[27] Miglin's family maintain that the killing was random, but former FBI agent Gregg McCrary argues it is unlikely that secondnameplaceholder would have bound and tortured Miglin without some motive.[16]Investigators noted Miglin's 1994 green Lexus LS sedan was missing from his garage and found Madson's red Jeep parked on the street near Miglin's house. Miglin's Lexus was equipped with a car phone, which, according to Ameritech Cellular records, was activated on May 4 in Union County, Pennsylvania. Authorities began monitoring this phone's activity and found it was also activated on May 8 in Philadelphia and on May 9 near Penns Grove and Carneys Point Township, New Jersey.[28]On May 9, in Pennsville Township, New Jersey, at Finn's Point National Cemetery, secondnameplaceholder shot and killed 45-year-old caretaker William Reese. Later that day, when Reese did not return home for dinner, his wife visited the cemetery to check on him and found the caretaker's office door ajar with the radio playing inside. She then called the police, who found Reese shot in the head by the same Taurus pistol secondnameplaceholder used to murder Madson.[29] Unlike secondnameplaceholder's other victims, whom he killed for seemingly personal reasons, authorities believe secondnameplaceholder murdered Reese simply for his 1995 red Chevrolet pickup truck. secondnameplaceholder used this truck to drive to Florida.[30]On May 12, secondnameplaceholder began staying at the Normandy Plaza Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, where he paid $29 per night in cash.[31] On June 12, he was listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.[32] While the manhunt unsuccessfully focused on Reese's stolen truck that secondnameplaceholder was using, the killer "hid in plain sight" for two months.[16] secondnameplaceholder used his own name to pawn a stolen item on July 7, despite knowing that police routinely reviewed pawn shop records.[33] On July 14, seemingly out of money, secondnameplaceholder checked out of his hotel without paying for his last night there.[31]Around 8:45 a.m. on July 15, secondnameplaceholder murdered 50-year-old Gianni Versace on the front steps of Casa Casuarina, his mansion in Miami Beach.[13] Versace was returning from a visit to the News Cafe, where he picked up magazines,[34] when he was shot once in the back of the head and once in the left cheek[35] with the same Taurus pistol secondnameplaceholder used to murder Madson and Reese. A witness pursued secondnameplaceholder but was unable to catch him as he fled into a nearby parking garage.[3][13] Versace was pronounced dead at Jackson Memorial Hospital at 9:21 a.m.[36]Responding police found Reese's stolen vehicle in a nearby parking garage. It contained secondnameplaceholder's clothes and clippings of newspaper reports about the earlier murders.[14]
<h2>Death</h2>
On July 23, 1997, secondnameplaceholder's body was found in a luxury houseboat in Miami Beach, after a caretaker reported hearing a gunshot to police.[37] He shot himself in the head[38] with the Taurus pistol stolen from Trail; it was the same weapon he used to kill Madson, Reese, and Versace.[14][33][39]secondnameplaceholder's cremated remains are interred in the mausoleum at Holy Cross Cemetery in San Diego.[40]
<h2>Motive</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's motivation remains unknown; at the time of the murders there was extensive public and press speculation linking the crimes to secondnameplaceholder's alleged discovery that he was HIV positive,[41] although an autopsy revealed he was HIV negative.[42][43]Although police searched the houseboat where secondnameplaceholder died, he left no suicide note and few personal belongings.[44] Investigators noted secondnameplaceholder's reputation for acquiring money and expensive possessions from wealthy older men.[44] Police considered few of the findings to be of note, except multiple tubes of hydrocortisone cream and a fairly extensive collection of fiction by C. S. Lewis.[44][45][46]
<h2>In popular culture</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was portrayed by Shane Perdue in the film The Versace Murder (1998),[47] Jonathan Trent in the film Murder in Fashion (2009),[48] Luke Morrison in the television film House of Versace (2013), and Darren Criss in The Assassination of Gianni Versace (2018), the second season of the television series American Crime Story.He has also been the subject of several true crime television series' episodes: Mugshots on Court TV, with "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder – The Versace Killer",[49] and Six Degrees of Murder, with "The Body in the Rug".[50] He has also been featured on ABC's news television series 20/20,[51] and Investigation Discovery's show Most Evil in various episodes, where he is examined by Columbia University forensic psychiatrist Michael H. Stone.[52]

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (July 10, 1960 – September 3, 2013) was born in Duey, Yauco, Puerto Rico, the son of Pedro secondnameplaceholder (1938–2004) and Lillian Rodriguez (born 1942).[12] secondnameplaceholder's parents divorced when he was a child, and he moved to mainland United States with his mother and three full siblings. They settled in Reading, Pennsylvania, and then moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where secondnameplaceholder's father and other family members were living.[13][14][15][16] secondnameplaceholder had nine siblings (both full and half)[17] and graduated from Cleveland's Lincoln-West High School in 1979.[18][19]secondnameplaceholder met his girlfriend Grimilda Figueroa when his family moved into a house across the street from hers in the 1980s. They lived with both sets of parents, but moved into their own home at 2207 Seymour Avenue in 1992.[20][21] Their home was a two-story, 1,400-square-foot (130 m2), four-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a 760-square-foot (71 m2) unfinished basement built in 1890 and remodeled in 1956.[22][23][24] Figueroa's sister Elida Caraballo said that "all hell started breaking loose" when the couple moved into their new home. Caraballo and her husband Frank claim that secondnameplaceholder beat Figueroa, breaking her nose, ribs, and arms and causing a blood clot on her brain that resulted in an inoperable tumor.[25] He also threw her down a flight of stairs, cracking her skull.[21] In 1993, secondnameplaceholder was arrested for domestic violence but was not indicted by a grand jury.[26]Figueroa moved out of the home in 1996 and secured custody of her four children. Police assisted in the move and detained secondnameplaceholder, but they did not press charges.[21] secondnameplaceholder continued to threaten and attack Figueroa after she left him, according to Caraballo. Figueroa filed charges in 2005 in Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court accusing him of inflicting multiple severe injuries on her and of "frequently" abducting their daughters. The court granted her a temporary restraining order against secondnameplaceholder, but it was dismissed a few months later.[21] Figueroa died in April 2012 due to complications from her brain tumor.[21] Friends and relatives gathered on Denison Avenue on April 29, 2012, for memorial services in her honor.[27]Before his arrest at age 52,[28] secondnameplaceholder worked as a bus driver for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District until he was fired for "bad judgment", including making an illegal U-turn with children on his bus,[29][30] using his bus to go grocery shopping, leaving a child on the bus while he went for lunch, and leaving the bus unattended while he took a nap at home.[23] He was earning $18.91 per hour when he was discharged.[31] At the time of his arrest, secondnameplaceholder's home was in foreclosure after three years of unpaid real estate taxes.[32]

The court granted her a temporary restraining order against secondnameplaceholder, but it was dismissed a few months later.[21] Figueroa died in April 2012 due to complications from her brain tumor.[21] Friends and relatives gathered on Denison Avenue on April 29, 2012, for memorial services in her honor.[27]Before his arrest at age 52,[28] secondnameplaceholder worked as a bus driver for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District until he was fired for "bad judgment", including making an illegal U-turn with children on his bus,[29][30] using his bus to go grocery shopping, leaving a child on the bus while he went for lunch, and leaving the bus unattended while he took a nap at home.[23] He was earning $18.91 per hour when he was discharged.[31] At the time of his arrest, secondnameplaceholder's home was in foreclosure after three years of unpaid real estate taxes.[32]
<h2>Kidnappings</h2>
secondnameplaceholder kidnapped his victims by offering them a ride; he drove each to his home, lured them inside, took them to the basement, and restrained them[33][34][35] in his house at 2207 Seymour Avenue, located in Cleveland's residential Tremont neighborhood.[36][37][38][39] The house has since been demolished.[40]Michelle Knight (born April 23, 1981) disappeared on August 23, 2002, after leaving a cousin's house.[41] She was 21 years old at the time.[42] On the day of her disappearance, she was scheduled to appear in court for a child custody case involving her son Joey, who was in the custody of the state.[41][43]Following Knight's rescue, police acknowledged that limited resources had been spent on investigating her disappearance, in part because she was an adult. Authorities believed that she had run away voluntarily due to anger over losing custody of her son. According to Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba, she was "the focus of very few tips".[44] Some have criticized her removal from the National Crime Information Center database. This event happened 15 months after she disappeared, so she was largely unknown prior to her rescue. Cleveland Police and the FBI maintain that her inclusion or exclusion had no bearing on her rescue.[45]Amanda Marie Berry (born April 22, 1986) disappeared on April 21, 2003, the day before her 17th birthday.[46] She was last heard from around 8:00 PM when she called her sister to tell her that she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue.[36] The FBI initially considered her a runaway until a week after her disappearance, when an unidentified male used her cell phone to call her mother. He said: "I have Amanda. She's fine and will be coming home in a couple of days".[47][48]Berry was featured in a 2004 segment of Fox's America's Most Wanted (re-aired in 2005 and 2006), which linked her to Gina DeJesus, who by that point had also gone missing in Cleveland.[49][50] Berry and DeJesus were profiled on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Montel Williams Show, where self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne told Berry's mother Louwana Miller in 2004 that her daughter was dead and that she was "in water".[51][52][53][54] This pronouncement devastated her mother, causing her to take down pictures and give away Berry's computer.[55] However, Miller continued to search for Berry before dying from heart failure in early March 2006.[49][56] Later that year, on December 25, 2006, Berry gave birth to a daughter.[57] DNA evidence has confirmed that secondnameplaceholder was the father of the child.[58][59]Robert Wolford was a prison inmate who had lived in Tremont, and he claimed in July 2012 that he had information about the location of Berry's body. He led police to an empty lot on Cleveland's West Side, where they conducted a fruitless search.[49][60] He was sentenced in January 2013 to 4½ years in prison for obstruction of justice, making a false report, and making a false alarm.[61]Georgina "Gina" Lynn DeJesus (born February 13, 1990) went missing at age 14.[62] She was last seen at a payphone around 3:00 PM on April 2, 2004, while on the way home from her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain Avenue. At the time, she was friends with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's daughter, Arlene secondnameplaceholder. Shortly before Gina disappeared, she and Arlene had called Arlene's mother, Grimilda Figueroa, for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied that they could not and the two girls parted ways.[63] Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.[64]DeJesus was under the impression that secondnameplaceholder was picking her up to drop her off at home, and she trusted secondnameplaceholder because she was friends with his teenage daughter. No one witnessed her abduction, and an AMBER Alert was not issued, which angered her father. He said in 2006, "The Amber Alert should work for any missing child. ... Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law".[60]A year after her disappearance, the FBI released a composite sketch and description of a male suspect, described as "Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m), 165 to 185 pounds (75 to 84 kg), with green eyes, a goatee, and possibly a pencil-thin beard".[65] According to court records, secondnameplaceholder was 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), 179 pounds (81 kg), with brown eyes and a goatee.[66][67]DeJesus was featured in the America's Most Wanted segment which linked her to Berry.[68] The disappearances received regular media attention into 2012, while the families held public vigils. secondnameplaceholder attended at least two of these vigils,[69][70] reportedly participated in a search party, and tried to get close to the DeJesus family.[71] secondnameplaceholder's son Anthony was a journalism student in 2004, and he interviewed DeJesus's mother for an article about the disappearances in the Plain Press.[26][72][73] Police kept the investigation open and offered a $25,000 reward for information.[74][75]According to secondnameplaceholder's uncle, his family knew the DeJesus family and had lived in the same West Cleveland neighborhood.[29] secondnameplaceholder eventually claimed that he was not aware that DeJesus was a member of that family when he abducted her.[76]
<h2>Captivity</h2>
secondnameplaceholder kidnapped Knight, took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at secondnameplaceholder's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women "speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war, of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of emotional abuse, of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were "emptied infrequently".[77] They were fed one meal a day and allowed to shower twice a week at most.[33]Knight told police that secondnameplaceholder had impregnated her at least five times and had induced miscarriages each time through beatings, hitting her with dumbbells, punching her, and slamming her against walls. He also starved her.[35][78] Knight's grandmother told reporters that she would require facial reconstruction surgery due to the beatings that she endured, and she lost hearing in one ear.[79] At one point, she had a pet dog while in captivity, but secondnameplaceholder killed it by snapping its neck after it bit him while trying to protect Knight.[80] DeJesus told law enforcement that she was raped but did not believe that she was ever impregnated.[78]On Christmas Day 2006, secondnameplaceholder allegedly ordered Knight to assist in the birth of Berry's child, which took place in a small inflatable swimming pool, and he threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive. At one point, the baby stopped breathing, but Knight was able to resuscitate her.[81][82] secondnameplaceholder occasionally took Amanda's daughter out of the house, including to visit his mother; she called him "daddy" and secondnameplaceholder's mother "grandmother".[83][84] In 2013, he showed one of his adult daughters a picture of her and said that she was his girlfriend's daughter from a previous relationship. He had told others that she was his granddaughter.[81][85] Berry taught her daughter how to read and write.According to a statement from Cleveland Police, officers visited secondnameplaceholder's home only once following the kidnappings to discuss an unrelated incident. secondnameplaceholder did not appear to be home at the time and was later interviewed elsewhere. Neighbors claimed to have called the police about suspicious activity observed at the home, but police have said that they have no record of any such calls.[86] secondnameplaceholder's son Anthony reported that there were certain areas of the house that were inaccessible due to being locked.[87] He also mentioned an occasion three weeks before the women's escape when secondnameplaceholder asked him if Berry would ever be found. Anthony said that he told secondnameplaceholder that Berry was likely dead, to which secondnameplaceholder responded: "Really? You think so?"[88]NBC affiliate WKYC reported that secondnameplaceholder recalled each of the three abductions in great detail during his interrogation and indicated that they were unplanned crimes of opportunity. According to WKYC's sources, secondnameplaceholder did not have an "exit plan" and believed that he would eventually be caught. He referred to himself as "coldblooded" and a sex addict.[89][90] Police found a suicide note in his home in which he discussed the abductions and wrote that his money and possessions should be given to the kidnapped women if he were caught.[89]
<h2>Escape and rescue</h2>
On May 6, 2013, Berry was finally able to make contact with secondnameplaceholder's neighbors, leading to her escape with her 6-year-old daughter and the rescue of DeJesus and Knight by authorities.[36] According to police, secondnameplaceholder left the house that day and Berry realized that he failed to lock the "big inside door", although the exterior storm door was bolted.[91][92][93][94] She did not attempt to break through the outer door because she thought that secondnameplaceholder "was testing her", according to the police report. Previously, secondnameplaceholder had tested the women by leaving the house partially unlocked and exits unsecured. If they attempted to escape, he beat them. Instead, Berry screamed for help when she saw neighbors through the screen.[91][95][96][97]Neighbor Angel Cordero responded to the screaming[98] but was unable to communicate with Berry because he spoke little English. Neighbor Charles Ramsey joined Cordero at the house's front door during the rescue.[99] They kicked a hole through the bottom of the storm door and Berry crawled through, carrying her daughter. Ramsey said that Berry told him that she and her child were being kept inside the house against her will. Upon being freed, she went to the house of another Spanish-speaking neighbor[98] and, with Ramsey's assistance, called 9-1-1, saying "Help me, I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for ten years. And I'm here. I'm free now!"[5][100]Responding police officers entered secondnameplaceholder's house. They walked through an upstairs hallway with guns drawn, announcing themselves as Cleveland Police. After peeking out from a slightly opened bedroom door, Knight entered the hallway and leaped into an officer's arms, repeatedly saying, "You saved me." Soon afterward, DeJesus entered the hallway from another room.[34] Knight and DeJesus walked out of the home, and all three women, plus the child, were taken to MetroHealth Medical Center.[60] Berry and DeJesus were released from the hospital the next day,[101] and Knight was discharged four days later on May 10.[102]The rescue of the women also reignited hope for the family of Ashley Summers, another young woman who disappeared in the Cleveland area in early July 2007[103] after leaving her home after a dispute with her parents. Police initially believed that there could be other captives in the Seymour Avenue home, but found none. As of July 2021[update], Summers is still missing.[104]
<h2>Arrest and legal proceedings</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was arrested on May 6, 2013.[1] He was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape on May 8, which carry prison sentences of ten years to life in Ohio.[1][105] Two of secondnameplaceholder's brothers were also initially taken into custody, but were released on May 9 after police announced that they had no involvement in the kidnappings.[106]secondnameplaceholder made his first court appearance at the Cleveland Municipal Court on May 9, where bail was set at $2 million per kidnapping charge, adding to a total of $8 million.[107][108][109] Additional charges were reported to be pending, including aggravated murder (for intentional induction of miscarriages), attempted murder, assault, a charge for each instance of rape, and a kidnapping charge for each day each captive was held.[2] On May 14, secondnameplaceholder's attorneys said he would plead "not guilty" to all charges if indicted for kidnapping and rape.[110][111][112]A Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment against secondnameplaceholder on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a death penalty specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings.[113][114]After entering a not guilty plea for secondnameplaceholder on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against secondnameplaceholder were indisputable, "it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty". He noted, "We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community".[115] secondnameplaceholder was found competent to stand trial on July 3.[116]On July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007. It brought the total to 977 counts: 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 of rape, seven of gross sexual imposition, six of felonious assault, three of child endangerment, two of aggravated murder, and one of possession of criminal tools.[117] On July 17, secondnameplaceholder pleaded not guilty to the expanded indictment.[118]secondnameplaceholder pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a plea bargain which called for consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 1,000 years, all without parole.[8] Under the plea deal, secondnameplaceholder forfeited his right to appeal, and could not profit in any way due to his crimes. He also forfeited his assets, including his home, which prosecutors said would be demolished.[119] secondnameplaceholder was told by Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Russo, "You will not be getting out. Is that clear?" to which secondnameplaceholder responded, "I do understand that, your honor."[120] secondnameplaceholder also made comments about his "addiction to pornography" and "sexual problem", but was cut off by Judge Russo, who said such issues could be discussed at the August 1 sentencing hearing.[119] A law firm representing Berry, DeJesus, and Knight released a statement that the three women were "relieved by today's plea. They are satisfied by this resolution to the case, and are looking forward to having these legal proceedings draw to a final close in the near future".[119]At the sentencing hearing on August 1, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government.[121] Before his sentencing, secondnameplaceholder addressed the court for nearly 20 minutes, in which he said he was "a good person" and "not a monster", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had "practiced the art of masturbation" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that "most" of the sex he had with them "was consensual". He shifted between apologizing and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as blaming his victims themselves for getting in a car with a stranger, along with insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: "I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home".[76]The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told secondnameplaceholder: "You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us ... I can forgive you, but I will never forget."[121]
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
Knight, Berry, and DeJesus released a video statement on July 9, 2013, thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said that the women "still have a strong desire for privacy" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal.[122][123] The Cleveland Courage Fund is a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life which had collected approximately $1.05 million at the time of the video's release.[122] Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic Chevrolet Monte Carlo, built in the year when she was born. He kept the car after her kidnapping in case she was still found alive. He still had it for her when she was released,[124] although it was in need of restoration from having been unused. Several automotive shops offered to perform the restoration for free.[125]Knight discussed some of her ordeals in an interview with People Magazine one year after her release, as well as her life leading up to her abduction. Since her rescue, she legally changed her name to Lily Rose Lee,[126] and began to get several tattoos as her way of coping with the healing process. She also revealed that her son was adopted by his foster parents while she was in captivity and that she wanted to see him, but she does not want to bring him into the ordeal which she has had to deal with, and planned to see him after he becomes an adult. She planned to open a restaurant and dreamed of getting married, which she did in 2016,[127] and hopes to adopt children, as her years of abuse and torture have made it unlikely for her to ever be able to give birth again. She also planned to reunite with Berry and DeJesus in the future, but began focusing on getting her own life back on track.[128]Berry and DeJesus received honorary diplomas from John Marshall High School in 2015.[129]
In an interview with WKYC-TV, DeJesus says that she is currently volunteering for the Amber Alert committee, offering comfort to families of abducted children. She remains in touch with Berry and her family.[130] In February 2017, Berry joined the staff of WJW (Fox 8) in Cleveland, where she hosts short recurring segments in which she reports missing person cases. She does this to help families reunite with missing family members.[131] In April 2019, Berry reunited with Charles Ramsey, six years since her rescue, at an interview that was broadcast by Fox 8.[132][133]As part of the plea bargain, the house where secondnameplaceholder had lived and held the women captive was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons to spectators, which she said represented missing children. The balloons were released before DeJesus's aunt began the demolition with a swing of a crane.[134][135][136] The house has been completely blurred out on the street view of Google Maps.[137][138]secondnameplaceholder was found hanging from a bed sheet in his detention cell at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, on the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence. He was 53 at the time of his death.[139] Prison staff performed CPR on him before he was taken to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, where he was pronounced dead shortly after.[139][140][141] The following day, Franklin County coroner Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary autopsy had found the cause of secondnameplaceholder's death to be suicide by hanging.[142]On October 10, 2013, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction released a report which suggested that secondnameplaceholder may have died accidentally from auto-erotic asphyxiation rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said that two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of secondnameplaceholder hours before he was found dead.[143] secondnameplaceholder was not on suicide watch at the time of his death but had been subjected to routine checks every 30 minutes due to his notoriety.[139]A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that "all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in secondnameplaceholder's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment." The Ohio State Highway Patrol also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.[11]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (German: Seyß-Inquart, [ˈartuːɐ̯ zaɪs ˈʔɪŋkvart] (listen); 22 July 1892 – 16 October 1946) was an Austrian Nazi politician who was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity. Inquart oversaw deportations, massacres and looting in Poland and the Netherlands[1]  and served as Chancellor of Austria in 1938 for two days before the Anschluss. His positions in Hitler's Third Reich included "deputy governor to Hans Frank in the General Government of Occupied Poland, and Reich commissioner for the German-occupied Netherlands" including shared responsibility "for the deportation of Dutch Jews and the shooting of hostages".[2] secondnameplaceholder was hanged on October 16, 1946.[3][4]During World War I, secondnameplaceholder fought for the Austro-Hungarian Army with distinction. After the war he became a successful lawyer, and went on to join the governments of Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg. In 1938, Schuschnigg resigned in the face of a German invasion, and secondnameplaceholder was appointed his successor. The newly installed Nazis proceeded to transfer power to Germany, and Austria subsequently became the German province of Ostmark, with secondnameplaceholder as its governor (Reichsstatthalter).During World War II, secondnameplaceholder served briefly as the Deputy Governor General in occupied Poland and, following the fall of the Low Countries in 1940, he was appointed Reichskommissar of the occupied Netherlands. He instituted a reign of terror, with Dutch civilians subjected to forced labour and the vast majority of Dutch Jews deported and murdered.At the Nuremberg trials, secondnameplaceholder was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, sentenced to death, and executed.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born in 1892 in Stannern (Czech: Stonařov), a German-speaking village in the neighbourhood of the predominantly German-speaking town of Iglau (Czech: Jihlava). This area constituted a German linguistic island in the midst of a Czech-speaking region; this may have contributed to the outspoken national consciousness of the family, and the young firstnameplaceholder in particular. Iglau was an important town in Moravia, one of the Czech provinces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in which there was increasing competition between Germans and Czechs. His parents were the school principal Emil Zajtich (who changed his surname to secondnameplaceholder) and Augusta Hirenbach. His father was Czech and his mother was German.The family moved to Vienna in 1907. secondnameplaceholder later studied law at the University of Vienna. At the beginning of World War I in August 1914 secondnameplaceholder enlisted with the Austrian Army and was given a commission with the Tyrolean Kaiserjäger, subsequently serving in Russia, Romania and Italy. He was decorated for bravery on a number of occasions, and while recovering from wounds in 1917, he completed his final examinations for his degree. secondnameplaceholder had five older siblings: Hedwig (born 1881), Richard (born 3 April 1883, became a Catholic priest, but left the Church and ministry, married in a civil ceremony and became Oberregierungsrat (senior government counsel) and prison superior by 1940 in the Ostmark), Irene (born 1885), Henriette (born 1887) and Robert (born 1891).In 1911, secondnameplaceholder met Gertrud Maschka. The couple married in December 1916 and had three children: Ingeborg Carolina Augusta secondnameplaceholder (born 18 September 1917), Richard secondnameplaceholder (born 22 August 1921) and Dorothea secondnameplaceholder (born 7 May 1928).
<h2>Political career and theAnschluss</h2>
He went into law after the war and in 1921 set up his own practice. During the early years of the Austrian First Republic, he was close to the Fatherland Front. A successful lawyer, he was invited to join the cabinet of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933. Following Dollfuss' murder in 1934, he became a State Councillor from 1937 under Kurt Schuschnigg. A keen mountaineer, secondnameplaceholder became the head of the German-Austrian Alpine Club. He later became a devotee of Heinrich Himmler's concepts of racial purity and sponsored various expeditions to Tibet and other parts of Asia in hopes of proving Aryan racial concepts and theories. He was not initially a member of the Austrian National Socialist party, though he was sympathetic to many of their views and actions.[5] By 1938, however, secondnameplaceholder knew which way the political wind was blowing and became a respectable frontman for the Austrian National Socialists.In February 1938, secondnameplaceholder was appointed Austrian Minister of the Interior by Schuschnigg, after Hitler had threatened Schuschnigg with military actions against Austria in the event of non-compliance. On 11 March 1938, faced with a German invasion aimed at preventing a plebiscite on independence, Schuschnigg resigned as Austrian Chancellor.  Under growing pressure from Berlin, President Wilhelm Miklas reluctantly appointed secondnameplaceholder his successor. On the next day German troops crossed the border of Austria at the telegraphed invitation of secondnameplaceholder.  This telegram had actually been drafted beforehand and was released after the troops had begun to march, so as to justify the action in the eyes of the international community. Before his triumphant entry into Vienna, Hitler had planned to leave Austria as a pro-Nazi puppet state headed by secondnameplaceholder. However, the acclamation for the German army from the majority of the Austrian population led Hitler to change course and opt for a full Anschluss, in which Austria was incorporated into the Third Reich as the province of Ostmark. Only then, on 13 March 1938, did secondnameplaceholder join the Nazi Party.[6]
<h2>Head of Ostmark and Southern Poland</h2>
secondnameplaceholder drafted the legislative act reducing Austria to a province of Germany and signed it into law on 13 March. With Hitler's approval he became Governor (Reichsstatthalter) of the newly named Ostmark, thus becoming Hitler's personal representative in Austria. Ernst Kaltenbrunner served as chief minister and Josef Burckel as Commissioner for the Reunion of Austria (concerned with the "Jewish Question"). secondnameplaceholder also received an honorary SS rank of Gruppenführer and in May 1939 he was made a Reichsminister without Portfolio in Hitler's cabinet.  Almost as soon as he took office, he ordered the confiscation of Jewish property and sent Jews to concentration camps.  Late in his regime, he collaborated in the deportation of Jews from Austria.Following the invasion of Poland, secondnameplaceholder was named as the Chief of Civil Administration for Southern Poland, but did not take up that post before the General Government was created, in which he became Deputy to the Governor General Hans Frank, remaining in this position until 18 May 1940.[7] He fully supported the heavy-handed policies put into effect by Frank, including persecution of Jews.  He was also aware of the Abwehr's murder of Polish intellectuals.
<h2>Reichskommissar in the Netherlands</h2>
Following the capitulation of the Low Countries secondnameplaceholder was appointed Reichskommissar for the Occupied Netherlands in May 1940, charged with directing the civil administration, with creating close economic collaboration with Germany and with defending the interests of the Reich. Among the Dutch people he was mockingly referred to as "Zes en een kwart" (six and a quarter), a play on his name, and the fact that secondnameplaceholder suffered from a limp. He supported the Dutch NSB and allowed them to create the paramilitary Nederlandse Landwacht, which acted as an auxiliary police force. Other political parties were banned in late 1941 and many former government officials were imprisoned at Sint-Michielsgestel. The administration of the country was controlled by secondnameplaceholder himself and he answered directly to Hitler.[8] He oversaw the politicization of cultural groups from the Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer "right down to 'the chessplayers' club", and set up a number of other politicised associations.He introduced measures to combat resistance, and when there was a widespread strike in Amsterdam, Arnhem and Hilversum in May 1943, special summary court-martial procedures were brought in, and a collective fine of 18 million guilders was imposed. Up until the liberation, secondnameplaceholder authorized about 800 executions, although some reports put the total at over 1,500, including executions under the so-called "Hostage Law", the death of political prisoners who were close to being liberated[clarification needed], the Putten raid, and the reprisal executions of 117 Dutchmen for the attack on SS and Police Leader Hanns Albin Rauter. Although the majority of secondnameplaceholder's powers were transferred to the military commander in the Netherlands and the Gestapo in July 1944, he remained a force to be reckoned with. It is thought he met with Haj Amin al-Husseini, an exiled leader of Palestinian Arabs, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, somewhere in Germany in 1943.[9]There were three concentration camps in the Netherlands: the smaller KZ Herzogenbusch near Vught, Kamp Amersfoort near Amersfoort, and Westerbork transit camp (a "Jewish assembly camp"); there were a number of other camps variously controlled by the military, the police, the SS or secondnameplaceholder's administration. These included a "voluntary labour recruitment" camp at Ommen (Camp Erika). In total around 530,000 Dutch civilians were forced to work for the Germans, of whom 250,000 were sent to factories in Germany. There was an unsuccessful attempt by secondnameplaceholder to send only workers aged 21 to 23 to Germany, and he refused demands in 1944 for a further 250,000 Dutch workers and in that year sent only 12,000 people.secondnameplaceholder was an unwavering anti-Semite; within a few months of his arrival in the Netherlands, he took measures to remove Jews from the government, the press and leading positions in industry. Anti-Jewish measures intensified after 1941: approximately 140,000 Jews were registered, a "ghetto" was created in Amsterdam and a transit camp was set up at Westerbork. Subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald, a concentration camp located within Germany's borders, and to Mauthausen, located in Upper Austria. Later, the Dutch Jews were sent to Auschwitz, the notorious complex operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. As Allied forces approached in September 1944, the remaining Jews at Westerbork were removed to Theresienstadt, the SS-established concentration camp/ghetto in the Nazi German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia. Of the 140,000 that were registered, only 30,000 Dutch Jews survived the war.When the Allies advanced into the Netherlands in late 1944, the Nazi regime had attempted to enact a scorched earth policy, and some docks and harbours were destroyed. secondnameplaceholder, however, was in agreement with Armaments Minister Albert Speer over the futility of such actions, and with the open connivance of many military commanders, they greatly limited the implementation of the scorched earth orders.[6] At the very end of the "hunger winter" in April 1945, secondnameplaceholder was with difficulty persuaded by the Allies to allow airplanes to drop food for the hungry people of the occupied north-west of the country. Although he knew the war was lost, secondnameplaceholder did not want to surrender.[10]Before Hitler committed suicide in April 1945, he named a new government headed by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz in his last will and testament, in which secondnameplaceholder replaced Joachim von Ribbentrop, who had long since fallen out of favour, as Foreign Minister. It was a token of the high regard Hitler felt for his Austrian comrade, at a time when he was rapidly disowning or being abandoned by so many of his other key lieutenants in the Third Reich. Unsurprisingly, at such a late stage in the war, secondnameplaceholder failed to achieve anything in his new office.He remained in his posts until 7 May 1945, when, after a meeting with Dönitz to confirm his rescission of the scorched earth orders, he was arrested on the Elbe Bridge in Hamburg by two soldiers of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, one of whom was Norman Miller (birth name: Norbert Mueller), a German Jew from Nuremberg who had escaped to Britain at the age of 15 on a Kindertransport just before the war and then returned to Germany as part of the British occupation forces.[11] Miller's entire family had been killed at the Jungfernhof Camp in Riga, Latvia in March 1942.
<h2>Nuremberg trials</h2>
At the Nuremberg trials, secondnameplaceholder was defended by Gustav Steinbauer and faced four charges: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity. During the trial, Gustave Gilbert, an American army psychologist, was allowed to examine the Nazi leaders who were tried at Nuremberg for war crimes. Among other tests, a German version of the Wechsler-Bellevue IQ test was administered. firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder scored 141, the second highest among the defendants, behind Hjalmar Schacht.In his final statement, secondnameplaceholder denied knowledge of various war crimes including the shooting of hostages, and said that while he had moral objections to the deportation of Jews, there must sometimes be justifications for mass evacuations, and pointed to the Allies forcibly resettling millions of Germans after the war. He added that his "conscience was untroubled" as he improved the conditions of the Dutch people while Commissioner. secondnameplaceholder concluded by saying, "My last word is the principle by which I have always acted and to which I will adhere to my last breath: I believe in Germany."[12]secondnameplaceholder was acquitted of conspiracy, but convicted on all other counts and sentenced to death by hanging. The final judgment against him cited his involvement in harsh suppression of Nazi opponents and actions against the Jews during all his billets, but particularly stressed his activities in the Netherlands. It was these actions that were used to justify sending him to the gallows.Upon hearing of his death sentence, secondnameplaceholder was fatalistic: "Death by hanging... well, in view of the whole situation, I never expected anything different. It's all right."[13]Before his execution, secondnameplaceholder returned to the Catholic church, receiving absolution in the sacrament of confession from prison chaplain Father Bruno Spitzl.[14]He was hanged in Nuremberg Prison on 16 October 1946, at the age of 54, together with nine other Nuremberg defendants. He was the last to mount the scaffold, and his last words were the following: "I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples. I believe in Germany."His body, with those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring, was cremated at the Ostfriedhof in Munich, and their ashes were scattered into the river Isar.[15][16][17]

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (born Henry McCarty; September 17 or November 23, 1859 – July 14, 1881), also known by the pseudonym William H. Bonney, was an outlaw and gunfighter of the American Old West, who killed eight men before he was shot and killed at the age of 21.[3][4] He also fought in New Mexico's Lincoln County War, during which he allegedly committed three murders.McCarty was orphaned at the age of 15. His first arrest was for stealing food, at the age of 16, in late 1875. Ten days later, he robbed a Chinese laundry and was again arrested, but escaped shortly afterwards. He fled from New Mexico Territory into neighboring Arizona Territory, making himself both an outlaw and a federal fugitive. In 1877, McCarty began to call himself "William H. Bonney".[5] Two versions of a wanted poster dated September 23, 1875, refer to him as "Wm. Wright, better known as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder".After murdering a blacksmith during an altercation in August 1877, McCarty became a wanted man in Arizona and returned to New Mexico, where he joined a group of cattle rustlers. He became well known in the region when he joined the Regulators and took part in the Lincoln County War of 1878. McCarty and two other Regulators were later charged with killing three men, including Lincoln County Sheriff William J. Brady and one of his deputies.McCarty's notoriety grew in December 1880 when the Las Vegas Gazette, in Las Vegas, New Mexico, and The Sun, in New York City, carried stories about his crimes.[6] Sheriff Pat Garrett captured McCarty later that month. In April 1881, McCarty was tried for and convicted of Brady's murder, and was sentenced to hang in May of that year. He escaped from jail on April 28, killing two sheriff's deputies in the process and evading capture for more than two months. Garrett shot and killed McCarty, by then age 21, in Fort Sumner on July 14, 1881. During the following decades, legends grew that McCarty had survived, and a number of men claimed to be him.[7] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder remains one of the most notorious figures from the era, whose life and likeness have been frequently dramatized in Western popular culture.
<h2>Early life</h2>
Henry McCarty was born to parents of Irish Catholic ancestry,[8] Catherine (née Devine) and Patrick McCarty, in New York City. While his birth year has been confirmed as 1859, the exact date of his birth has been disputed as either September 17 or November 23 of that year. A letter from an official of Saint Peter's Church in Manhattan states it is in possession of records showing McCarty was baptized there on September 28, 1859.[a][10][11][12] Census records indicate his younger brother, Joseph McCarty, was born in 1863.[13]Following the death of her husband Patrick, Catherine McCarty and her sons moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where she met William Henry Harrison Antrim. The McCarty family moved with Antrim to Wichita, Kansas, in 1870.[14] After moving again a few years later, Catherine married Antrim on March 1, 1873, at the First Presbyterian Church in Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory; McCarty and his brother Joseph were witnesses to the ceremony.[15][16] Shortly afterward, the family moved from Santa Fe to Silver City, New Mexico, and Joseph McCarty began using the name Joseph Antrim.[13] Shortly before McCarty's mother, Catherine, died of tuberculosis, then called "consumption", on September 16, 1874,[17] McCarty's stepfather, William Antrim abandoned the family leaving both McCarty boys orphans.McCarty was 15 years old when his mother died. Sarah Brown, the owner of a boarding house, gave him room and board in exchange for work. On September 16, 1875, McCarty was caught stealing food.[18][19] Ten days later, McCarty and George Schaefer robbed a Chinese laundry, stealing clothing and two pistols. McCarty was charged with theft and was jailed. He escaped two days later and became a fugitive,[18] as reported in the Silver City Herald the next day, the first story published about him. McCarty located his stepfather and stayed with him until Antrim threw him out; McCarty stole clothing and guns from him. It was the last time the two saw each other.[20]After leaving Antrim, McCarty traveled to southeastern Arizona Territory, where he worked as a ranch hand and gambled his wages in nearby gaming houses.[21] In 1876, he was hired as a ranch hand by well-known rancher Henry Hooker.[22][23] During this time, McCarty became acquainted with John R. Mackie, a Scottish-born criminal and former U.S. Cavalry private who, following his discharge, remained near the U.S. Army post at Camp Grant. The two men soon began stealing horses from local soldiers.[24][25] McCarty became known as "Kid Antrim" because of his youth, slight build, clean-shaven appearance, and personality.[26][27]On August 17, 1877, McCarty was at a saloon in the village of Bonita when he got into an argument with Francis P. "Windy" Cahill, a blacksmith who reportedly had bullied McCarty and on more than one occasion called him a "pimp". McCarty in turn called Cahill a "son of a bitch", whereupon Cahill threw McCarty to the floor and the two struggled for McCarty's revolver. McCarty shot and mortally wounded Cahill. A witness said, "[firstnameplaceholder] had no choice; he had to use his equalizer." Cahill died the following day.[28][29] McCarty fled but returned a few days later and was apprehended by Miles Wood, the local justice of the peace. McCarty was detained and held in the Camp Grant guardhouse but escaped before law enforcement could arrive.[30]McCarty stole a horse and fled Arizona Territory for New Mexico Territory,[31] but Apaches took the horse from him, leaving him to walk many miles to the nearest settlement. At Fort Stanton in the Pecos Valley,[32] McCarty—starving and near death—went to the home of friend and Seven Rivers Warriors gang member John Jones, whose mother Barbara nursed him back to health.[33][5] After regaining his health, McCarty went to Apache Tejo, a former army post, where he joined a band of rustlers who raided herds owned by cattle magnate John Chisum in Lincoln County. After McCarty was spotted in Silver City, his involvement with the gang was mentioned in a local newspaper.[34] At some point in 1877, McCarty began to refer to himself by the name "William H. Bonney".[5]
<h2>Lincoln County War</h2>
After returning to New Mexico, McCarty worked as a cowboy for English businessman and rancher John Henry Tunstall (1853–1878), near the Rio Felix, a tributary of the Rio Grande, in Lincoln County. Tunstall and his business partner and lawyer Alexander McSween were opponents of an alliance formed by Irish-American businessmen Lawrence Murphy, James Dolan, and John Riley. The three men had wielded an economic and political hold over Lincoln County since the early 1870s, due in part to their ownership of a beef contract with nearby Fort Stanton and a well-patronized dry goods store in the town of Lincoln.By February 1878, McSween owed $8,000 to Dolan, who obtained a court order and asked Lincoln County Sheriff William J. Brady to attach nearly $40,000 worth of Tunstall's property and livestock. Tunstall put Bonney in charge of nine prime horses and told him to relocate them to his ranch for safekeeping. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brady assembled a large posse to seize Tunstall's cattle.[35][36]On February 18, 1878, Tunstall learned of the posse's presence on his land and rode out to intervene. During the encounter, one member of the posse shot Tunstall in the chest, knocking him off his horse. Another posse member took Tunstall's gun and killed him with a shot to the back of his head.[36][37] Tunstall's murder ignited the conflict between the two factions that became known as the Lincoln County War.[36][38]After Tunstall was killed, McCarty and Dick Brewer swore affidavits against Brady and those in his posse, and obtained murder warrants from Lincoln County justice of the peace John B. Wilson.[39] On February 20, 1878, while attempting to arrest Brady, the sheriff and his deputies found and arrested McCarty and two other men riding with him.[40] Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Widenmann, a friend of McCarty, and a detachment of soldiers captured Sheriff Brady's jail guards, put them behind bars, and released Bonney and Brewer.[41]McCarty then joined the Lincoln County Regulators; on March 9 they captured Frank Baker and William Morton, both of whom were accused of killing Tunstall. Baker and Morton were killed while allegedly trying to escape.[42]On April 1, the Regulators ambushed Sheriff Brady and his deputies; McCarty was wounded in the thigh during the battle. Brady and Deputy Sheriff George W. Hindman were killed.[43] On the morning of April 4, 1878, Buckshot Roberts and Dick Brewer were killed during a shootout at Blazer's Mill.[44] Warrants were issued for several participants on both sides, and McCarty and two others were charged with killing Brady, Hindman and Roberts.[45]On the night of Sunday, July 14, McSween and the Regulators—now a group of fifty or sixty men—went to Lincoln and stationed themselves in the town among several buildings.[46] At the McSween residence were McCarty, Florencio Chavez, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Jim French, Harvey Morris, Tom O'Folliard, and Yginio Salazar, among others. Another group led by Marin Chavez and Doc Scurlock positioned themselves on the roof of a saloon. Henry Newton Brown, Dick Smith, and George Coe defended a nearby adobe bunkhouse.[47][48]On Tuesday, July 16, newly appointed sheriff George Peppin sent sharpshooters to kill the McSween defenders at the saloon. Peppin's men retreated when one of the snipers, Charles Crawford, was killed by Fernando Herrera. Peppin then sent a request for assistance to Colonel Nathan Dudley, commandant of nearby Fort Stanton. In a reply to Peppin, Dudley refused to intervene but later arrived in Lincoln with troops, turning the battle in favor of the Murphy-Dolan faction.[49][50]A shooting war broke out on Friday, July 19. McSween's supporters gathered inside his house; when Buck Powell and Deputy Sheriff Jack Long set fire to the building, the occupants began shooting. McCarty and the other men fled the building when all rooms but one were burning. During the confusion, Alexander McSween was shot and killed by Robert W. Beckwith, who was then shot and killed by McCarty.[51][52]
<h2>Outlaw</h2>
McCarty and three other survivors of the Battle of Lincoln were near the Mescalero Indian Agency when the agency bookkeeper, Morris Bernstein, was murdered on August 5, 1878. All four were indicted for the murder, despite conflicting evidence that Bernstein had been killed by Constable Atanacio Martinez. All of the indictments, except McCarty's, were later quashed.[53][54]On October 5, 1878, U.S. Marshal John Sherman informed newly appointed Territorial Governor and former Union Army general Lew Wallace that he held warrants for several men, including "William H. Antrim, alias Kid, alias Bonny [sic]" but was unable to execute them "owing to the disturbed condition of affairs in that county, resulting from the acts of a desperate class of men."[55] Wallace issued an amnesty proclamation on November 13, 1878, which pardoned anyone involved in the Lincoln County War since Tunstall's murder. It specifically excluded persons who had been convicted of or indicted for a crime, and therefore excluded McCarty.[56][57]On February 18, 1879, McCarty and friend Tom O'Folliard were in Lincoln and watched as attorney Huston Chapman was shot and his corpse set on fire. According to eyewitnesses, the pair were innocent bystanders forced at gunpoint by Jesse Evans to witness the murder.[58][59] McCarty wrote to Governor Wallace on March 13, 1879, with an offer to provide information on the Chapman murder in exchange for amnesty. On March 15, Governor Wallace replied, agreeing to a secret meeting to discuss the situation. McCarty met with Wallace in Lincoln on March 17, 1879. During the meeting and in subsequent correspondence, Wallace promised McCarty protection from his enemies and clemency if he would offer his testimony to a grand jury.[b]On March 20, Wallace wrote to McCarty, "to remove all suspicion of understanding, I think it better to put the arresting party in charge of Sheriff Kimbrell [sic] who shall be instructed to see that no violence is used."[c] McCarty responded on the same day, agreeing to testify and confirming Wallace's proposal for his arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety.[62][63] On March 21, McCarty let himself be captured by a posse led by Sheriff George Kimball of Lincoln County. As agreed, McCarty provided a statement about Chapman's murder and testified in court.[64] However, after McCarty's testimony, the local district attorney refused to set him free.[65][66] Still in custody several weeks later, McCarty began to suspect Wallace had used subterfuge and would never grant him amnesty. McCarty escaped from the Lincoln County jail on June 17, 1879.[67]McCarty avoided further violence until January 10, 1880, when he shot and killed Joe Grant, a newcomer to the area, at Hargrove's Saloon in Fort Sumner, New Mexico.[68] The Santa Fe Weekly New Mexican reported, "firstnameplaceholder Bonney, more extensively known as 'secondnameplaceholder,' shot and killed Joe Grant. The origin of the difficulty was not learned."[69] According to other contemporary sources, McCarty had been warned Grant intended to kill him. He walked up to Grant, told him he admired his revolver, and asked to examine it. Grant handed it over. Before returning the pistol, which he noticed contained only three cartridges, McCarty positioned the cylinder so the next hammer fall would land on an empty chamber. Grant suddenly pointed his pistol at McCarty's face and pulled the trigger. When it failed to fire, McCarty drew his own weapon and shot Grant in the head. A reporter for the Las Vegas Optic quoted McCarty as saying the encounter "was a game of two and I got there first."[70][71]In 1880, McCarty formed a friendship with a rancher named Jim Greathouse, who later introduced him to Dave Rudabaugh. On November 29, 1880, McCarty, Rudabaugh, and firstnameplaceholder Wilson ran from a posse led by sheriff's deputy James Carlysle. Cornered at Greathouse's ranch, McCarty told the posse they were holding Greathouse as a hostage. Carlysle offered to exchange places with Greathouse, and McCarty accepted the offer. Carlysle later attempted to escape by jumping through a window but he was shot three times and killed.[72] The shootout ended in a standoff; the posse withdrew and McCarty, Rudabaugh, and Wilson rode away.[73][74]A few weeks after the Greathouse incident, McCarty, Rudabaugh, Wilson, O'Folliard, Charlie Bowdre, and Tom Pickett rode into Fort Sumner. Unbeknownst to McCarty and his companions, a posse led by Pat Garrett was waiting for them. The posse opened fire, killing O'Folliard; the rest of the outlaws escaped unharmed.[75][76]On December 13, 1880, Governor Wallace posted a $500 bounty for McCarty's capture.[77] Pat Garrett continued his search for McCarty; on December 23, following the siege in which Bowdre was killed, Garrett and his posse captured McCarty along with Pickett, Rudabaugh, and Wilson at Stinking Springs. The prisoners, including McCarty, were shackled and taken to Fort Sumner, then later to Las Vegas, New Mexico. When they arrived on December 26, they were met by crowds of curious onlookers.The following day, an armed mob gathered at the train depot before the prisoners, who were already on board the train with Garrett, departed for Santa Fe.[78] Deputy Sheriff Romero, backed by the angry group of men, demanded custody of Dave Rudabaugh, who during an unsuccessful escape attempt on April 5, 1880 shot and killed deputy Antonio Lino Valdez in the process.[79]Garrett refused to surrender the prisoner, and a tense confrontation ensued until he agreed to let the sheriff and two other men accompany the party to Santa Fe, where they would petition the governor to release Rudabaugh to them.[80] In a later interview with a reporter, McCarty said he was unafraid during the incident, saying, "if I only had my Winchester I'd lick the whole crowd."[81][82] The Las Vegas Gazette ran a story from a jailhouse interview following McCarty's capture; when the reporter said Bonney appeared relaxed, he replied, "What's the use of looking on the gloomy side of everything? The laugh's on me this time."[83] During his short career as an outlaw, McCarty was the subject of numerous U.S. newspaper articles, some as far away as New York.[84]After arriving in Santa Fe, McCarty, seeking clemency, sent Governor Wallace four letters over the next three months. Wallace refused to intervene,[85] and McCarty went to trial in April 1881 in Mesilla, New Mexico.[86] Following two days of testimony, McCarty was found guilty of Sheriff Brady's murder; it was the only conviction secured against any of the combatants in the Lincoln County War. On April 13, Judge Warren Bristol sentenced McCarty to hang, with his execution scheduled for May 13, 1881.[86] According to legend, upon sentencing, the judge told McCarty he was going to hang until he was "dead, dead, dead"; McCarty's response was, "you can go to hell, hell, hell."[87] According to the historical record, he did not speak after the reading of his sentence.[88]Following his sentencing, McCarty was moved to Lincoln, where he was held under guard on the top floor of the town courthouse. On the evening of April 28, 1881, while Garrett was in White Oaks collecting taxes, Deputy Bob Olinger took five other prisoners across the street for a meal, leaving James Bell,[89] another deputy, alone with McCarty at the jail. McCarty asked to be taken outside to use the outhouse behind the courthouse; on their return to the jail, McCarty—who was walking ahead of Bell up the stairs to his cell—hid around a blind corner, slipped out of his handcuffs, and beat Bell with the loose end of the cuffs. During the ensuing scuffle, McCarty grabbed Bell's revolver and fatally shot him in the back as Bell tried to get away.[90]McCarty, with his legs still shackled, broke into Garrett's office and took a loaded shotgun left behind by Olinger. McCarty waited at the upstairs window for Olinger to respond to the gunshot that killed Bell and called out to him, "Look up, old boy, and see what you get." When Olinger looked up, Bonney shot and killed him.[90][91] [92] After about an hour, McCarty freed himself from the leg irons with an axe.[93] He obtained a horse and rode out of town; according to some stories he was singing as he left Lincoln.[91]While McCarty was on the run, Governor Wallace placed a new $500 bounty on the fugitive's head.[94][95][96] Almost three months after his escape, Garrett, responding to rumors that McCarty was in the vicinity of Fort Sumner, left Lincoln with two deputies on July 14, 1881, to question resident Pete Maxwell, a friend of McCarty's.[97] Maxwell, son of land baron Lucien Maxwell, spoke with Garrett the same day for several hours. Around midnight, the pair sat in Maxwell's darkened bedroom when McCarty unexpectedly entered.[98]Accounts vary as to the course of events. According to the canonical version, as he entered the room, McCarty failed to recognize Garrett due to the poor lighting. Drawing his revolver and backing away, McCarty asked "¿Quién es? ¿Quién es?" (Spanish for "Who is it? Who is it?").[99] Recognizing McCarty's voice, Garrett drew his revolver and fired twice.[100] The first bullet struck McCarty in the chest just above his heart, while the second missed. Garrett’s account leaves it unclear whether McCarty was killed instantly or took some time to die.[98][101]A few hours after the shooting, a local justice of the peace assembled a coroner's jury of six people. The jury members interviewed Maxwell and Garrett, and McCarty's body and the location of the shooting were examined. The jury certified the body as McCarty's and, according to a local newspaper, the jury foreman said, "It was secondnameplaceholder's' body that we examined."[102] McCarty was given a wake by candlelight; he was buried the next day and his grave was denoted with a wooden marker.[103][104]Five days after McCarty's killing, Garrett traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to collect the $500 reward offered by Governor Lew Wallace for his capture, dead or alive. William G. Ritch, the acting New Mexico governor, refused to pay the reward.[105] Over the next few weeks, the residents of Las Vegas, Mesilla, Santa Fe, White Oaks, and other New Mexico cities raised over $7,000 in reward money for Garrett. A year and four days after McCarty's death, the New Mexico territorial legislature passed a special act to grant Garrett the $500 bounty reward promised by Governor Wallace.[106]Because people had begun to claim Garrett unfairly ambushed McCarty, Garrett felt the need to tell his side of the story and called upon his friend, journalist Marshall Upson, to ghostwrite a book for him.[107] The book, The Authentic Life of firstnameplaceholder, secondnameplaceholder,[d] was first published in April 1882.[109] Although only a few copies sold following its release, in time, it became a reference for later historians who wrote about McCarty's life.[107]
<h2>Rumors of survival</h2>
Over time, legends grew claiming that McCarty was not killed, and that Garrett staged the incident and death out of friendship so that McCarty could evade the law.[110] During the next 50 years, a number of men claimed they were firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[citation needed] Most of these claims were easily disproven, but two have remained topics of discussion and debate.In 1948, a central Texas man, Ollie P. Roberts, also known as Brushy Bill Roberts, began claiming he was firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and went before New Mexico Governor Thomas J. Mabry seeking a pardon. Mabry dismissed Roberts' claims, and Roberts died shortly afterward.[111] Nevertheless, Hico, Texas, Roberts' town of residence, capitalized on his claim by opening a firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder museum.[112]John Miller, an Arizona man, also claimed he was McCarty. This was unsupported by his family until 1938, some time after his death. Miller's body was buried in the state-owned Arizona Pioneers' Home Cemetery in Prescott, Arizona; in May 2005, Miller's teeth and bones[113] were exhumed and examined,[114] without permission from the state.[115] DNA samples from the remains were sent to a laboratory in Dallas and tested to compare Miller's DNA with blood samples obtained from floorboards in the old Lincoln County courthouse and a bench where McCarty's body allegedly was placed after he was shot.[116] According to a July 2015 article in The Washington Post, the lab results were "useless."[113]In 2004, researchers sought to exhume the remains of Catherine Antrim, McCarty's mother, whose DNA would be tested and compared with that of the body buried in William Bonney's grave.[117] As of 2012[update], her body had not been exhumed.[116]In 2007,[118] author and amateur historian Gale Cooper filed a lawsuit against the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office under the state Inspection of Public Records Act to produce records of the results of the 2006 DNA tests and other forensic evidence collected in the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder investigations.[119] In April 2012, 133 pages of documents were provided; they offered no conclusive evidence confirming or disproving the generally accepted story of Garrett's killing of McCarty,
[118] but confirmed the records' existence, and that they could have been produced earlier.[116] In 2014, Cooper was awarded $100,000 in punitive damages but the decision was later overturned by the New Mexico Court of Appeals.[120] The lawsuit ultimately cost Lincoln County nearly $300,000.[118]In February 2015, historian Robert Stahl petitioned a district court in Fort Sumner asking the state of New Mexico to issue a death certificate for McCarty.[102] In July 2015, Stahl filed suit in the New Mexico Supreme Court. The suit asked the court to order the state's Office of the Medical Investigator to officially certify McCarty's death under New Mexico state law.[121]
<h2>Photographs</h2>
As of 2020[update], only one authenticated photograph showing Bonney exists; others thought to depict him are disputed.[122]One of the few remaining artifacts of McCarty's life is a 2-by-3-inch (5.1-by-7.6-centimeter) ferrotype photograph of McCarty by an unknown portrait photographer in late 1879 or early 1880. The image shows McCarty wearing a vest over a sweater, a slouch cowboy hat, and a bandana, while holding an 1873 Winchester rifle with its butt resting on the floor. For years, this was the only photograph scholars and historians agreed showed McCarty.[95] The ferrotype survived because McCarty's friend Dan Dedrick kept it after the outlaw's death. It was passed down through Dedrick's family, and was copied several times, appearing in numerous publications during the 20th century. In June 2011, the original plate was bought at auction for $2.3 million by businessman William Koch.[123][124]The image shows McCarty wearing his holstered Colt revolver on his left side. This led historians to believe he was left-handed, but they did not take into account that the ferrotype process produces reversed images.[125] In 1954, western historians James D. Horan and Paul Sann wrote that McCarty was right-handed and carried his pistol on his right hip.[126] The opinion was confirmed by Clyde Jeavons, a former curator of the National Film and Television Archive.[127] Several historians have written that McCarty was ambidextrous.[128][129][130][131]A 4-by-6-inch (100 mm × 150 mm) ferrotype purchased at a memorabilia shop in Fresno, California in 2010 has been claimed to show McCarty and members of the Regulators playing croquet. If authentic, it is the only known photo of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and the Regulators together and the only image to feature their wives and female companions.
[132] Collector Robert G. McCubbin and outlaw historian John Boessenecker concluded in 2013 that the photograph does not show McCarty.[133] Whitny Braun, a professor and researcher, located an advertisement for croquet sets sold at Chapman's General Store in Las Vegas, New Mexico, dated to June 1878. Kent Gibson, a forensic video and still image expert, offered the services of his facial recognition software, and stated that McCarty is indeed one of the individuals in the image.[134]In August 2015, Lincoln State Monument officials and the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs said that despite the new research, they could not confirm that the image showed McCarty or others from the Lincoln County War era, according to Monument manager Gary Cozzens. A photograph curator at the Palace of the Governors archives, Daniel Kosharek, said the image is "problematic on a lot of fronts," including the small size of the figures and the lack of resemblance of the background landscape to Lincoln County or the state in general.[134] Editors from the True West Magazine staff said, "no one in our office thinks this photo is of secondnameplaceholder [and the Regulators]."[133]In early October 2015, Kagin's, Inc., a numismatic authentication firm, said the image was authentic after a number of experts, including those associated with a recent National Geographic Channel program,[135][136]
examined it.[137][138]
<h2>Posthumous pardon request</h2>
In 2010, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson turned down a request for a posthumous pardon of McCarty for the murder of Sheriff William Brady. The pardon considered was to fulfill Governor Lew Wallace's 1879 promise to Bonney. Richardson's decision, citing "historical ambiguity," was announced on December 31, 2010, his last day in office.[139][140]
<h2>Grave markers</h2>
In 1931, Charles W. Foor, an unofficial tour guide at Fort Sumner Cemetery, campaigned to raise funds for a permanent marker for the graves of McCarty, O'Folliard, and Bowdre. As a result of his efforts, a stone memorial marked with the names of the three men and their death dates beneath the word "Pals" was erected in the center of the burial area.[141]In 1940, stone cutter James N. Warner of Salida, Colorado, made and donated to the cemetery a new marker for Bonney's grave.[142] It was stolen on February 8, 1981, but recovered days later in Huntington Beach, California. New Mexico Governor Bruce King arranged for the county sheriff to fly to California to return it to Fort Sumner,[143] where it was reinstalled in May 1981. Although both markers are behind iron fencing, a group of vandals entered the enclosure at night in June 2012 and tipped the stone over.[144]

Benjamin "firstnameplaceholder" secondnameplaceholder (February 28, 1906 – June 20, 1947) was an American mobster[2] who was a driving force behind the development of the Las Vegas Strip.[3] secondnameplaceholder not only was influential within the Jewish mob, but along with his friend and fellow gangster Meyer Lansky, also held significant influence within the Italian-American Mafia and the largely Italian-Jewish National Crime Syndicate. Described as handsome and charismatic, he became one of the first front-page celebrity gangsters.[4]secondnameplaceholder was one of the founders and leaders of Murder, Inc.[5] and became a bootlegger during Prohibition. After the Twenty-first Amendment was passed repealing Prohibition in 1933, he turned to gambling. In 1936, he left New York and moved to California.[6] His time as a mobster during this period was mainly as a hitman and muscle, as he was noted for his prowess with guns and violence. In 1941, secondnameplaceholder was tried for the murder of fellow mobster Harry Greenberg. He was acquitted in 1942.secondnameplaceholder traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he handled and financed some of the original casinos.[7] He assisted developer William R. Wilkerson's Flamingo Hotel after Wilkerson ran out of funds.[8] secondnameplaceholder took over the project and managed the final stages of construction. The Flamingo opened on December 26, 1946 to poor reception and soon closed. It reopened in March 1947 with a finished hotel. On June 20, 1947, secondnameplaceholder was shot dead at the home of his girlfriend, Virginia Hill, in Beverly Hills, California.
<h2>Early life</h2>
Benjamin secondnameplaceholder[1][9] was born on February 28, 1906, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, the second of five children of a poor Jewish family that emigrated to the U.S. from the Galicia region of what was then Austria-Hungary.[1][10][11] His parents, Jennie (Riechenthal) and Max secondnameplaceholder, constantly worked for meager wages.[12] As a boy, secondnameplaceholder left school and joined a gang on Lafayette Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He committed mainly thefts until he met Moe Sedway. Together with Sedway, he developed a protection racket in which he threatened to incinerate pushcart owners' merchandise unless they paid him a dollar.[13][14] He soon built up a lengthy criminal record, dating from his teenage years, that included armed robbery, rape and murder.[15]During adolescence, secondnameplaceholder befriended Meyer Lansky, who formed a small mob whose activities expanded to gambling and car theft. Lansky, who had already had a run-in with Charles "Lucky" Luciano, saw a need for the Jewish boys of his Brooklyn neighborhood to organize in the same manner as the Italians and Irish. The first person he recruited for his gang was secondnameplaceholder.[16]He became involved in bootlegging within several major East Coast cities. He also worked as the mob's hitman, whom Lansky would hire out to other crime families.[17] The two formed the Bugs and Meyer Mob, which handled hits for the various bootleg gangs operating in New York and New Jersey, doing so almost a decade before Murder, Inc. was formed. The gang kept themselves busy by hijacking the liquor cargoes of rival outfits,[18] and were known to be responsible for the killing and removal of several rival gangland figures.[19] secondnameplaceholder's gang mates included Abner "Longie" Zwillman, Louis "Lepke" Buchalter, and Lansky's brother, Jake; Joseph "Doc" Stacher, another member of the Bugs and Meyer Mob, recalled to Lansky biographers that secondnameplaceholder was fearless and saved his friends' lives as the mob moved into bootlegging:secondnameplaceholder was also a boyhood friend to Al Capone; when there was a warrant for Capone's arrest on a murder charge, secondnameplaceholder allowed him to hide out with an aunt.[21]He first smoked opium during his youth and was involved in the drug trade.[22] By age 21, he was making money, and flaunted it. He bought an apartment at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and a Tudor home in Scarsdale, New York. He wore flashy clothes and participated in New York City night life.[11][23]From May 13 to 16, 1929, Lansky and secondnameplaceholder attended the Atlantic City Conference, representing the Bugs and Meyer Mob.[24] Luciano and former Chicago South Side Gang leader Johnny Torrio held the conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. At the conference, the two men discussed the future of organized crime and the future structure of the Mafia crime families; secondnameplaceholder stated, "The yids and the dagos will no longer fight each other."On January 28, 1929, secondnameplaceholder married Esta Krakower, his childhood sweetheart. They had two daughters, Millicent secondnameplaceholder (later Millicent Rosen) and Barbara secondnameplaceholder (later Barbara Saperstein).[3] He had a reputation as a womanizer and the marriage ended in 1946.[25] His wife moved with their teenage daughters to New York.
<h2>Murder, Incorporated</h2>
By the late 1920s, Lansky and secondnameplaceholder had ties to Luciano and Frank Costello, future bosses of the Genovese crime family. secondnameplaceholder, Albert Anastasia, Vito Genovese, and Joe Adonis allegedly were the four gunmen who shot New York mob boss Joe Masseria to death on Luciano's orders on April 15, 1931, ending the Castellammarese War.[26][27] On September 10 of that year, Luciano hired four gunmen from the Bugs and Meyer Mob (some sources identify secondnameplaceholder as being one of the gunmen[28][29]) to murder Salvatore Maranzano in his New York office, establishing Luciano's rise to the top of the Mafia and marking the beginning of modern American organized crime.[30]Following Maranzano's death, Luciano and Lansky formed the National Crime Syndicate, an organization of crime families that brought power to the underworld.[5][31] The Commission was established for dividing Mafia territories and preventing future gang wars.[5] With his associates, secondnameplaceholder formed Murder, Inc. After he and Lansky moved on, control over Murder, Inc. was ceded to Buchalter and Anastasia,[18] although secondnameplaceholder continued working as a hitman.[32] secondnameplaceholder's only conviction was in Miami; on February 28, 1932, he was arrested for gambling and vagrancy, and, from a roll of bills, paid a $100 fine.[3]During this period, secondnameplaceholder had a disagreement with the Fabrizzo brothers, associates of Waxey Gordon. Gordon had hired the Fabrizzo brothers from prison after Lansky and secondnameplaceholder gave the IRS information about Gordon's tax evasion. It led to Gordon's imprisonment in 1933.[19] secondnameplaceholder hunted down and killed the Fabrizzos after they made an assassination attempt on him and Lansky.[33] After the deaths of his two brothers, Tony Fabrizzo had begun to write a memoir and gave it to an attorney. One of the longest chapters was to be a section on the nationwide kill-for-hire squad led by secondnameplaceholder. However, the mob discovered Fabrizzo's plans before he could execute them.[34] In 1932, after checking into a hospital to establish an alibi and later sneaking out, secondnameplaceholder joined two accomplices in approaching Fabrizzo's house and, posing as detectives to lure him outside, gunned him down.[35][34] In 1935, secondnameplaceholder assisted in Luciano's alliance with Dutch Schultz and killed rival loan sharks Louis "Pretty" Amberg and Joseph C. Amberg.[36][37]
<h2>California</h2>
secondnameplaceholder had learned from his associates that he was in danger: his hospital alibi had become questionable and his enemies wanted him dead.[38] In the late 1930s, the East Coast mob sent secondnameplaceholder to California.[39] Since 1933, he had traveled to the West Coast several times,[40] and in California, his mission was to develop syndicate-sanctioned gambling rackets with Los Angeles family boss Jack Dragna.[41] Once in Los Angeles, secondnameplaceholder recruited gang boss Mickey Cohen as his chief lieutenant.[42] Knowing secondnameplaceholder's reputation for violence, and that he was backed by Lansky and Luciano – who, from prison, sent word to Dragna that it was "in [his] best interest to cooperate"[32] – Dragna accepted a subordinate role.[43] On tax returns, secondnameplaceholder claimed to earn his living through legal gambling at Santa Anita Park.[44] He soon took over Los Angeles's numbers racket[45] and used money from the syndicate to help establish a drug trade route from Mexico and organized circuits with the Chicago Outfit's wire services.[46][47]By 1942, US$500,000 a day was coming from the syndicate's bookmaking wire operations.[45] In 1946, because of problems with secondnameplaceholder, the Outfit took over the Continental Press and gave the percentage of the racing wire to Dragna, infuriating secondnameplaceholder.[47][48] Despite his complications with the wire services, secondnameplaceholder controlled several offshore casinos[49] and a major prostitution ring.[17] He also maintained relationships with politicians, businessmen, attorneys, accountants, and lobbyists who fronted for him.[50]In Hollywood, secondnameplaceholder was welcomed in the highest circles and befriended movie stars.[4] He was known to associate with George Raft, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant,[51] as well as studio executives Louis B. Mayer and Jack L. Warner.[52] Actress Jean Harlow was a friend of secondnameplaceholder and godmother to his daughter Millicent. secondnameplaceholder bought real estate and threw lavish parties at his Beverly Hills home.[46] He gained admiration from young celebrities, including Tony Curtis,[53] Phil Silvers, and Frank Sinatra.secondnameplaceholder had several relationships with prominent women, including socialite Countess Dorothy di Frasso. The alliance with the countess took secondnameplaceholder to Italy in 1938,[54] where he met Benito Mussolini, to whom secondnameplaceholder tried to sell weapons. secondnameplaceholder also met Nazi leaders Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels, to whom he took an instant dislike and later offered to kill.[55][56][57] He only relented because of the countess's anxious pleas.[51]In Hollywood, secondnameplaceholder worked with the syndicate to form illegal rackets.[43] He devised a plan of extorting movie studios; he would take over local trade unions (such as the Screen Extras Guild and the Los Angeles Teamsters) and stage strikes to force studios to pay him off so that unions would start working again.[47] secondnameplaceholder borrowed money from celebrities and didn't pay them back, knowing that they would never ask him for the money.[58][59] During his first year in Hollywood, he received more than US$400,000 in loans from movie stars.On November 22, 1939, secondnameplaceholder, Whitey Krakower, Frankie Carbo and Albert Tannenbaum killed Harry "Big Greenie" Greenberg outside his apartment. Greenberg had threatened to become a police informant,[60] and Buchalter ordered his killing.[61] Tannenbaum confessed to the murder[62] and agreed to testify against secondnameplaceholder.[63] secondnameplaceholder was implicated in the murder, and in September 1941, was put on trial.[64] The trial soon gained notoriety because of the preferential treatment secondnameplaceholder received in jail; he refused to eat prison food, was allowed female visitors, and was granted leave for dental visits.[45][65] secondnameplaceholder hired attorney Jerry Giesler for his defense. After the deaths of two state witnesses,[45][66] no additional witnesses came forward. Tannenbaum's testimony was dismissed.[67] In 1942, secondnameplaceholder was acquitted due to insufficient evidence[67] but his reputation was damaged.During the trial, newspapers revealed secondnameplaceholder's past and referred to him as "firstnameplaceholder". secondnameplaceholder hated the nickname (said to be based on the slang term "bugs", meaning "crazy", used to describe his erratic behavior), preferring to be called "Ben" or "Mr. secondnameplaceholder".[68] On May 25, 1944, secondnameplaceholder was arrested for bookmaking. Raft and Mack Gray testified on secondnameplaceholder's behalf, and in late 1944, secondnameplaceholder was acquitted again.[69]
<h2>Las Vegas</h2>
In 1945, secondnameplaceholder found an opportunity to reinvent his personal image and diversify into legitimate business with William R. Wilkerson's Flamingo Hotel.[70] In the 1930s, secondnameplaceholder had traveled to southern Nevada with Sedway to explore expanding operations there. He had found opportunities in providing illicit services to crews constructing the Boulder Dam. Lansky had handed over operations in Nevada to secondnameplaceholder, who turned it over to Sedway and left for Hollywood.[71][72]In the mid-1940s, secondnameplaceholder was lining things up in Las Vegas while his lieutenants worked on a business policy to secure all gambling in Los Angeles.[73] In May 1946, he decided that the agreement with Wilkerson had to be altered to give him control of the Flamingo.[74] With the Flamingo, secondnameplaceholder would supply the gambling, the best liquor and food, and the biggest entertainers at reasonable prices. He believed that these attractions would lure not only the high rollers but thousands of vacationers willing to gamble $50 or $100.[49] Wilkerson was eventually coerced into selling all stakes in the Flamingo under the threat of death and went into hiding in Paris for a time.[75] From this point the Flamingo became syndicate-run.[76]secondnameplaceholder began a spending spree. He demanded the finest building that money could buy at a time of postwar shortages. As costs soared, his checks began bouncing. By October 1946, the Flamingo's costs were above US$4 million.[77] By 1947, the costs were over US$6 million (equivalent to $61 million in 2019).[78] By late November of that year, the work was nearly finished.[79]According to later reports by local observers, secondnameplaceholder's "maniacal chest-puffing" set the pattern for several generations of notable casino moguls.[17] His violent reputation didn't help his situation. After he boasted one day that he'd personally killed some men, secondnameplaceholder saw the panicked look on the face of head contractor Del Webb and reassured him: "Del, don't worry, we only kill each other."[80] Other associates portrayed secondnameplaceholder in a different aspect; he was an intense character who was not without a charitable side, including his donations for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund.[17] Lou Wiener Jr., secondnameplaceholder's Las Vegas attorney, described him as "very well liked" and said that he was "good to people".[17]Problems with the Outfit's wire service had cleared up in Nevada and Arizona, but in California, secondnameplaceholder refused to report business.[73] He later announced to his colleagues that he was running the California syndicate by himself and that he would return the loans in his "own good time". Despite secondnameplaceholder's defiance to the mob bosses, they were patient with him because he had always proven to be a valuable man.[81]The Flamingo opened on December 26, 1946, at which time only the casino, lounge, theater, and restaurant were finished.[82] Although locals attended the opening, few celebrities materialized. A handful drove in from Los Angeles, despite bad weather. Some celebrities present were Raft, June Haver, Vivian Blaine, Sonny Tufts, Brian Donlevy, and Charles Coburn. They were welcomed by construction noise and a lobby draped with drop cloths. The desert's first air conditioning system broke down regularly. While gambling tables were operating, the luxury rooms that would have served as the lure for people to stay and gamble were not ready. As word of the losses made their way to secondnameplaceholder during the evening, he began to become irate and verbally abusive, throwing out at least one family.[83] After two weeks, the Flamingo's gaming tables were $275,000 in the red and the entire operation shut down in late January 1947.[84]After being granted a second chance, secondnameplaceholder knuckled down and did everything possible to turn the Flamingo into a success by making renovations and obtaining good press. He hired future newsman Hank Greenspun as a publicist. The hotel reopened on March 1, 1947—with Lansky present[85]—and began turning a profit.[86][87] However, by the time profits began improving, the mob bosses above secondnameplaceholder were tired of waiting. Although time was running out, at age 41, secondnameplaceholder had carved out a name for himself in the annals of organized crime and in Las Vegas history.[17]
<h2>Murder</h2>
On the night of June 20, 1947, as secondnameplaceholder sat with his associate Allen Smiley in Virginia Hill's Beverly Hills home reading the Los Angeles Times, an unknown assailant fired at him through the window with a .30 caliber military M1 carbine, hitting him many times, including twice in the head.[17] No one was charged with killing secondnameplaceholder, and the crime remains officially unsolved.[3]One theory posits that secondnameplaceholder's death was the result of his excessive spending and possible theft of money from the mob.[88][89] In 1946, a meeting was held with the "board of directors" of the syndicate in Havana, Cuba so that Luciano, exiled in Sicily, could attend and participate. A contract on secondnameplaceholder's life was the conclusion.[90] According to Stacher, Lansky reluctantly agreed to the decision.[91] Another theory is that secondnameplaceholder was shot to death preemptively by Mathew "Moose" Pandza, the lover of Sedway's wife Bee, who went to Pandza after learning that secondnameplaceholder was threatening to kill her husband. secondnameplaceholder apparently had grown increasingly resentful of the control Sedway, at mob behest, was exerting over secondnameplaceholder's finances and planned to do away with him.[92] Former Philadelphia family boss Ralph Natale has claimed that Carbo was responsible for murdering secondnameplaceholder, at the behest of Lansky.[93]secondnameplaceholder's death certificate states the manner of death as homicide and the cause as "Gunshot Wounds of the head."[94] secondnameplaceholder was hit by several other bullets, including shots through his lungs.[47] According to Florabel Muir, "Four of the nine shots fired that night destroyed a white marble statue of Bacchus on a grand piano, and then lodged in the far wall."The day after secondnameplaceholder's death, the Los Angeles Herald-Express carried a photograph on its front page from the morgue of secondnameplaceholder's bare right foot with a toe tag.[95] Although secondnameplaceholder's murder occurred in Beverly Hills, his death thrust Las Vegas into the national spotlight as photographs of his lifeless body were published in newspapers throughout the country.[46] The day after secondnameplaceholder's murder, David Berman and his Las Vegas mob associates, Sedway and Gus Greenbaum, walked into the Flamingo and took over operation of the hotel and casino.[96]In the Bialystoker Synagogue on New York's Lower East Side, secondnameplaceholder is memorialized by a Yahrtzeit (remembrance) plaque that marks his death date so mourners can say Kaddish for the anniversary. secondnameplaceholder's plaque is below that of Max secondnameplaceholder, his father, who died just two months before his son. On the property at the Flamingo Las Vegas, between the pool and a wedding chapel, is a memorial plaque to secondnameplaceholder.[97] secondnameplaceholder is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.

firstnameplaceholder Milles secondnameplaceholder (né Maddox; November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017)[2] was an American criminal and cult leader. In mid-1967, he formed what became known as the "secondnameplaceholder Family", a quasi-commune based in California. His followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. Although the motive for the murders was disputed by secondnameplaceholder, the Los Angeles County District Attorney believed that secondnameplaceholder intended to start a race war.[3] In 1971, he was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while secondnameplaceholder never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.[4]Before the murders, secondnameplaceholder had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions. When he began gathering his cult following, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, who introduced secondnameplaceholder to record producer Terry Melcher. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded secondnameplaceholder's song "Cease to Exist", re-titled "Never Learn Not to Love" as the B-side on one of their singles, but without a credit to secondnameplaceholder. Wilson and Melcher severed ties with secondnameplaceholder in 1969.[5]The Los Angeles district attorney said that secondnameplaceholder was obsessed with the Beatles, particularly their 1968 self-titled album. secondnameplaceholder had claimed to be guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term "Helter Skelter" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. At trial, the prosecution submitted that secondnameplaceholder and his followers believed that the murders would help precipitate that war. Other contemporary interviews and those who testified during secondnameplaceholder's trial insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes designed to exonerate secondnameplaceholder's friend Bobby Beausoleil.[6][7]secondnameplaceholder's notoriety as an emblem of insanity, violence, and the macabre has also influenced pop culture. Recordings of songs written and performed by secondnameplaceholder were released commercially, starting with Lie: The Love and Terror Cult (1970). Various musicians have covered some of his songs.  Although originally sentenced to death, his sentence was commuted to life with the possibility of parole after the California Supreme Court invalidated the state's death penalty statute in 1972. He served his life sentence at California State Prison, Corcoran and died at age 83 in late 2017.
<h2>1934–1967: Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on November 12, 1934, to 16-year-old Kathleen secondnameplaceholder-Bower-Cavender,[8] née Maddox (1918–1973),[9] in the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was first named "no name Maddox".[10][page needed][11][12] Within weeks, he was called firstnameplaceholder Milles Maddox.[13][14]secondnameplaceholder's biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr. (1910–1954)[15] of Catlettsburg, Kentucky, against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937. secondnameplaceholder may never have known his biological father.[10][page needed][12] Scott worked intermittently in local mills, and had a local reputation as a con artist. He allowed Maddox to believe that he was an army colonel, although "Colonel" was merely his given name. When Maddox told Scott that she was pregnant, he told her he had been called away on army business; after several months she realized he had no intention of returning.[16]In August 1934, before secondnameplaceholder's birth, Maddox married William Eugene secondnameplaceholder (1909–1961), a "laborer" at a dry cleaning business. Maddox often went on drinking sprees with her brother Luther, leaving firstnameplaceholder with multiple babysitters. They divorced on April 30, 1937, after William alleged "gross neglect of duty" by Maddox. firstnameplaceholder retained William's last name, secondnameplaceholder.[17] On August 1, 1939, Luther and Kathleen Maddox were arrested for assault and robbery. Kathleen and Luther were sentenced to five and ten years of imprisonment, respectively.[18]secondnameplaceholder was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia.[19] His mother was paroled in 1942. secondnameplaceholder later characterized the first weeks after she returned from prison as the happiest time in his life.[20] Weeks after Maddox's release, secondnameplaceholder's family moved to firstnameplaceholderton, West Virginia,[21] where secondnameplaceholder continually played truant and his mother spent her evenings drinking.[22] She was arrested for grand larceny, but not convicted.[23] The family later moved to Indianapolis, where Maddox met an alcoholic named Lewis (no first name) through Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and married him in August 1943.[22]In an interview with Diane Sawyer, secondnameplaceholder said that when he was nine, he set his school on fire.[24] secondnameplaceholder also got in trouble for truancy and petty theft. Although there were a lack of foster home placements, in 1947, at the age of 13, secondnameplaceholder was placed in the Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute, Indiana, a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests.[25]  Gibault was a strict school, where punishment for even the tiniest infraction included beatings with either a wooden paddle or a leather strap. secondnameplaceholder ran away from Gibault and slept in the woods, under bridges, and wherever else he could find shelter.[26]secondnameplaceholder fled home to his mother, and spent Christmas 1947 in McMechen, at his aunt and uncle's house.[27] His mother returned him to Gibault. Ten months later, he ran away to Indianapolis.[28] In 1948, in Indianapolis, secondnameplaceholder committed his first known crime by robbing a grocery store. At first the robbery was simply to find something to eat. However, secondnameplaceholder found a cigar box containing just over a hundred dollars, and he took the money. He used the money to rent a room on Indianapolis's Skid Row and to buy food.[29]For a time, secondnameplaceholder tried to go straight by getting a job delivering messages for Western Union. However, he quickly began to supplement his wages through petty theft.[26] He was eventually caught, and in 1949 a sympathetic judge sent him to Boys Town, a juvenile facility in Omaha, Nebraska.[30] After four days at Boys Town, he and fellow student Blackie Nielson obtained a gun and stole a car. They used it to commit two armed robberies on their way to the home of Nielson's uncle in Peoria, Illinois.[31][32] Nielson's uncle was a professional thief, and when the boys arrived he allegedly took them on as apprentices.[25] secondnameplaceholder was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store. In the investigation that followed, he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies. He was sent to the Indiana Boys School, a strict reform school.[33]At the school, other students allegedly raped secondnameplaceholder with the encouragement of a staff member, and he was repeatedly beaten. He ran away from the school eighteen times.[30] While at the school, secondnameplaceholder developed a self-defense technique he later called the "insane game".  When he was physically unable to defend himself, he would screech, grimace and wave his arms to convince aggressors that he was insane. After a number of failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in February 1951.[34][32] The three escapees were robbing filling stations while attempting to drive to California in stolen cars when they were arrested in Utah. For the federal crime of driving a stolen car across state lines, secondnameplaceholder was sent to Washington, D.C.'s National Training School for Boys.[35] On arrival he was given aptitude tests which determined that he was illiterate, but had an above-average IQ of 109. His case worker deemed him aggressively antisocial.[34][32]On a psychiatrist's recommendation, secondnameplaceholder was transferred in October 1951 to Natural Bridge Honor Camp, a minimum security institution.[32] His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and would help him find work. secondnameplaceholder had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952. However, in January, he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint. secondnameplaceholder was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in Petersburg, Virginia. There he committed a further "eight serious disciplinary offenses, three involving homosexual acts". He was then moved to a maximum security reformatory at Chillicothe, Ohio, where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955. Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954, to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen.[36]In January 1955, secondnameplaceholder married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Jean Willis.[37][page needed] Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio, secondnameplaceholder was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' probation. secondnameplaceholder's failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at Terminal Island, San Pedro, California.[32]While secondnameplaceholder was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, secondnameplaceholder received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, secondnameplaceholder tried to escape by stealing a car. He was given five years' probation and his parole was denied.[32]secondnameplaceholder received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged U.S. Treasury check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a 10-year suspended sentence and probation after a young woman named Leona, who had an arrest record for prostitution, made a "tearful plea" before the court that she and secondnameplaceholder were "deeply in love ... and would marry if Charlie were freed".[32] Before the year's end, the woman did marry secondnameplaceholder, possibly so she would not be required to testify against him.[32]secondnameplaceholder took Leona and another woman to New Mexico for purposes of prostitution, resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the Mann Act. Though he was released, secondnameplaceholder correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared in violation of his probation, a bench warrant was issued. An indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed in April 1960.[32] Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution, secondnameplaceholder was arrested in June in Laredo, Texas, and was returned to Los Angeles. For violating his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his ten-year sentence.[32]secondnameplaceholder spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation. In July 1961, he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington. There, he took guitar lessons from Barker–Karpis gang leader Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, and obtained from another inmate a contact name of someone at Universal Studios in Hollywood, Phil Kaufman.[38] Among his fellow prisoners during this time was Danny Trejo, who participated in several hypnosis sessions.[39] According to Jeff Guinn's 2013 biography of secondnameplaceholder, his mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.[40]Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. secondnameplaceholder's September 1961 annual review noted he had a "tremendous drive to call attention to himself", an observation echoed in September 1964.[32] In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce. During the process she alleged that she and secondnameplaceholder had a son, firstnameplaceholder Luther.[32] According to a popular urban legend, secondnameplaceholder auditioned unsuccessfully for the Monkees in late 1965; this is refuted by the fact that secondnameplaceholder was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time.[41]In June 1966, secondnameplaceholder was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release. By the time of his release day on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken federal laws. Federal sentences were, and remain, much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay.[32]
<h2>1968–1971: Cult formation, murders, and trial</h2>
After being discharged from prison in 1967, secondnameplaceholder began attracting a group of followers, mostly young women, from around California. They were later known as the secondnameplaceholder Family.[42] The core members of secondnameplaceholder's group following included: firstnameplaceholder 'Tex' Watson, a musician and former actor; Robert Beausoleil, a former musician and pornographic actor; Mary Brunner, previously a librarian; Susan Atkins; Linda Kasabian; Patricia Krenwinkel; and Leslie Van Houten.[43][44][45]The secondnameplaceholder Family developed into a doomsday cult when secondnameplaceholder became fixated on the idea of an imminent apocalyptic race war between America's black population and the larger white population. A white supremacist,[46][47] secondnameplaceholder believed that black people in America would rise up and kill all whites except for secondnameplaceholder and his "Family", but that they were not intelligent enough to survive on their own; they would need a white man to lead them, and so they would serve secondnameplaceholder as their "master".[48][49] Late in 1968, secondnameplaceholder adopted the term "Helter Skelter", taken from a song on the Beatles' recently released White Album, to refer to this upcoming war.[50]In early August 1969, secondnameplaceholder encouraged his followers to start Helter Skelter, by committing murders in Los Angeles and making it appear to be racially motivated. The secondnameplaceholder Family gained national notoriety after the murder of actress Sharon Tate and four others in her home on August 8 and 9, 1969,[51] and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the next day. Tex Watson and three other members of the Family executed the Tate–LaBianca murders, allegedly acting under secondnameplaceholder's instructions.[52][53] While it was later accepted at trial that secondnameplaceholder never expressly ordered the murders, his behavior was deemed to warrant a conviction of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Evidence pointed to secondnameplaceholder's obsession with inciting a race war by killing those he thought were "pigs" and his belief that this would show the "nigger" how to do the same.[4] Family members were also responsible for other assaults, thefts, crimes, and the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford in Sacramento by Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme.[54]While it is often thought that secondnameplaceholder never murdered or attempted to murder anyone himself, true crime writer James Buddy Day, in his book Hippie Cult Leader: The Last Words of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, claimed that secondnameplaceholder shot drug dealer Bernard Crowe on July 1, 1969.[55] Crowe survived.[56]The State of California tried secondnameplaceholder for the Tate and LaBianca murders with co-defendants, Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel. Co-defendant Tex Watson was tried at a later date after being extradited from Texas.[57]The trial began on July 15, 1970.  secondnameplaceholder appeared wearing fringed buckskins, his typical clothing at Spahn Ranch.[58]On July 24, 1970 — the first day of testimony — secondnameplaceholder appeared in court with an "X" carved into his forehead. His followers issued a statement from secondnameplaceholder saying "I have "X'd myself from your world".[59] The following day, secondnameplaceholder's co-defendants, Van Houten, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, also appeared in court, with an "X" carved in their foreheads.[60][61]Members of the secondnameplaceholder Family camped outside of the courthouse, and held a vigil on a street corner, because they were excluded from the courtroom for being disruptive. Some of secondnameplaceholder's followers also carved crosses into their heads.[59] During the trial, members of the secondnameplaceholder Family appeared in saffron robes, and threatened to immolate themselves if secondnameplaceholder was convicted – just as nuns in Vietnam had done in protest of the war.[58][62]The State presented dozens of witnesses during the trial. However, its primary witness was Linda Kasabian, who was present during the Tate murders on August 8–9, 1969. Kasabian provided graphic testimony of the Tate murders, which she observed from outside the house. She was also in the car with secondnameplaceholder on the following evening, when he ordered the LaBianca killings. Kasabian spent days on the witness stand, being cross-examined by the defendants' lawyers. After testifying, Kasabian went into hiding for the next forty years.[10][page needed]In early August 1970, President Richard Nixon told reporters that he believed that secondnameplaceholder was guilty of the murders, "either directly or indirectly".[63] secondnameplaceholder obtained a copy of the newspaper and held up the headline to the jury.[10][page needed] The defendants' attorneys then called for a mistrial, arguing that their clients had allegedly killed far fewer people than "Nixon's war machine in Vietnam".[63] Judge firstnameplaceholder H. Older polled each member of the jury, to determine whether each juror saw the headline and whether it affected his or her ability to make an independent decision. All of the jurors affirmed that they could still decide independently.[10][page needed] Shortly after, the female defendants – Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten – were removed from the room for chanting, "Nixon says we are guilty. So why go on?"[10][page needed]On October 5, 1970, secondnameplaceholder attempted to attack Judge Older while the jury was present in the room. secondnameplaceholder first threatened Older, and then jumped over his lawyer's table with a sharpened pencil, in the direction of Older. secondnameplaceholder was restrained before reaching the judge. While being led out of the courtroom, secondnameplaceholder screamed at Older, "In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut your head off!" Meanwhile, the female defendants began chanting something in Latin. Judge Older began wearing a .38 caliber pistol to the trial afterwards.[64]On November 16, 1970, the State of California rested its case after presenting twenty-two weeks worth of evidence. The defendants then stunned the courtroom by announcing that they had no witnesses to present, and rested their case.[65]Immediately after defendants' counsel rested their case, the three female defendants shouted that they wanted to testify. Their attorneys advised the court, in chambers, that they opposed their clients testifying.  Apparently, the female defendants wanted to testify that secondnameplaceholder had had nothing to do with the murders.[66]The following day, secondnameplaceholder himself announced that he too wanted to testify. The judge allowed secondnameplaceholder to testify outside the presence of the jury.  He stated as follows:secondnameplaceholder continued, equating his actions to those of society at large:secondnameplaceholder concluded, claiming that he too was a creation of a system that he viewed as fundamentally violent and unjust:After secondnameplaceholder finished speaking, Judge Older offered to let him testify before the jury.  secondnameplaceholder replied that it was not necessary.  secondnameplaceholder then told the female defendants that they no longer needed to testify.[68]On November 30, 1970, Leslie Van Houten's attorney, Ronald Hughes, failed to appear for the closing arguments in the trial.[68] He was later found dead in a California state park. His body was badly decomposed, and it was impossible to tell the cause of death.  Hughes had disagreed with secondnameplaceholder during the trial, taking the position that his client, Van Houten, should not testify to claim that secondnameplaceholder had no involvement with the murders. Some have alleged that Hughes may have been murdered by the secondnameplaceholder Family.[69]On January 25, 1971, the jury found secondnameplaceholder, Krenwinkel and Atkins guilty of first degree murder in all seven of the Tate and LaBianca killings. The jury found Van Houten guilty of murder in the first degree in the LaBianca killings.[70]After the convictions, the court held a separate hearing before the same jury to determine if the defendants should receive the death sentence.Each of the three female defendants – Atkins, Van Houten, and Krenwinkel – took the stand. They provided graphic details of the murders and testified that secondnameplaceholder was not involved.  According to the female defendants, they had committed the crimes in order to help fellow secondnameplaceholder Family member Bobby Beausoleil get out of jail, where he was being held for the murder of Gary Hinman. The female defendants testified that the Tate-LaBianca murders were intended to be copycat crimes, similar to the Hinman killing. Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten claimed they did this under the direction of the state's prime witness, Linda Kasabian. The defendants did not express remorse for the killings.[71]On March 4, 1971, during the sentencing hearings, secondnameplaceholder trimmed his beard to a fork and shaved his head, telling the media, "I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head!" However, the female defendants did not immediately shave their own heads. The state prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, later speculated in his book, Helter Skelter, that they refrained from doing so, in order to not appear to be completely controlled by secondnameplaceholder (as they had when they each carved an "X" in their foreheads, earlier in the trial).[72]On March 29, 1971, the jury sentenced all four defendants to death. When the female defendants were led into the courtroom, each of them had shaved their heads, as had secondnameplaceholder. After hearing the sentence, Atkins shouted to the jury, "Better lock your doors and watch your kids."[73]The secondnameplaceholder murder trial was the longest murder trial in American history when it occurred, lasting nine and a half months. The trial was among the most publicized American criminal cases of the twentieth century and was dubbed the "trial of the century". The jury had been sequestered for 225 days, longer than any jury before it. The trial transcript alone ran to 209 volumes or 31,716 pages.[73]
<h2>1971–2017: Third imprisonment</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April 22, 1971, for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski, Jay Sebring, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. As the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972, secondnameplaceholder was re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. His initial death sentence was modified to life on February 2, 1977.On December 13, 1971, secondnameplaceholder was convicted of first-degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July 25, 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman. He was also convicted of first-degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Jerome "Shorty" Shea. Following the 1972 decision of California v. Anderson, California's death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that "any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death."[74] secondnameplaceholder was thus eligible to apply for parole after seven years' incarceration.[75] His first parole hearing took place on November 16, 1978, at California Medical Facility in Vacaville, where his petition was rejected.[76][77]In the 1980s, secondnameplaceholder gave four interviews to the mainstream media. The first, recorded at California Medical Facility and aired on June 13, 1981, was by Tom Snyder for NBC's The Tomorrow Show. The second, recorded at San Quentin State Prison and aired on March 7, 1986, was by Charlie Rose for CBS News Nightwatch, and it won the national news Emmy Award for Best Interview in 1987.[78] The third, with Geraldo Rivera in 1988, was part of the journalist's prime-time special on Satanism.[79] At least as early as the Snyder interview, secondnameplaceholder's forehead bore a swastika in the spot where the X carved during his trial had been.[80]Nikolas Schreck conducted an interview with secondnameplaceholder for his documentary firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Superstar (1989). Schreck concluded that secondnameplaceholder was not insane but merely acting that way out of frustration.[81][82]On September 25, 1984, secondnameplaceholder was imprisoned in the California Medical Facility at Vacaville when inmate Jan Holmstrom poured paint thinner on him and set him on fire, causing second and third degree burns on over 20 percent of his body. Holmstrom explained that secondnameplaceholder had objected to his Hare Krishna chants and verbally threatened him.[76][failed verification]After 1989, secondnameplaceholder was housed in the Protective Housing Unit at California State Prison, Corcoran, in Kings County. The unit housed inmates whose safety would be endangered by general-population housing. He had also been housed at San Quentin State Prison,[78] California Medical Facility in Vacaville,[76][failed verification] Folsom State Prison and Pelican Bay State Prison.[83][citation needed]
In June 1997, a prison disciplinary committee found that secondnameplaceholder had been trafficking drugs.[83] He was moved from Corcoran State Prison to Pelican Bay State Prison a month later.[83]On September 5, 2007, MSNBC aired The Mind of secondnameplaceholder, a complete version of a 1987 interview at California's San Quentin State Prison. The footage of the "unshackled, unapologetic, and unruly" secondnameplaceholder had been considered "so unbelievable" that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on Today, for which it had been recorded.[84]In March 2009, a photograph of secondnameplaceholder showing a receding hairline, grizzled gray beard and hair, and the swastika tattoo still prominent on his forehead was released to the public by California corrections officials.[85]In 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that secondnameplaceholder was caught with a cell phone in 2009 and had contacted people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia. A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if secondnameplaceholder had used the phone for criminal purposes.[86] secondnameplaceholder also recorded an album of acoustic pop songs with additional production by Henry Rollins, titled Completion. Only five copies were pressed: two belong to Rollins, while the other three are presumed to have been with secondnameplaceholder. The album remains unreleased.[87]
<h2>Illness and death</h2>
On January 1, 2017, secondnameplaceholder was suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding at California State Prison in Corcoran when he was rushed to Mercy Hospital in downtown Bakersfield. A source told the Los Angeles Times that secondnameplaceholder was seriously ill,[88] and TMZ reported that his doctors considered him "too weak" for surgery.[89] He was returned to prison on January 6, and the nature of his treatment was not disclosed.[90] On November 15, 2017, an unauthorized source said that secondnameplaceholder had returned to a hospital in Bakersfield,[91] but the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation did not confirm this in conformity with state and federal medical privacy laws.[92] He died from cardiac arrest resulting from respiratory failure and colon cancer at the hospital on November 19.[2][93][94]Three people stated their intention to claim secondnameplaceholder's estate and body.[95][96][97] secondnameplaceholder's grandson Jason Freeman stated his intent to take possession of secondnameplaceholder's remains and personal effects.[98] secondnameplaceholder's pen-pal Michael Channels claimed to have a secondnameplaceholder will dated February 14, 2002, which left secondnameplaceholder's entire estate and secondnameplaceholder's body to Channels.[99][100] secondnameplaceholder's friend Ben Gurecki claimed to have a secondnameplaceholder will dated January 2017 which gives the estate and secondnameplaceholder's body to Matthew Roberts, another alleged son of secondnameplaceholder.[95][96] In 2012, CNN ran a DNA match to see if Freeman and Roberts were related to each other and found that they were not. According to CNN, two prior attempts to DNA match Roberts with genetic material from secondnameplaceholder failed, but the results were reportedly contaminated.[101] On March 12, 2018, the Kern County Superior Court in California decided in favor of Freeman in regard to secondnameplaceholder's body. Freeman had secondnameplaceholder cremated on March 20, 2018.[102] As of February 7, 2020, Channels and Freeman still had petitions to California courts attempting to establish the heir of secondnameplaceholder's estate. At that time, Channels was attempting to force Freeman to submit DNA to the court for testing.[103]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder began studying Scientology while incarcerated with the help of fellow inmate Lanier Rayner, and 
in July 1961, secondnameplaceholder listed his religion as Scientology.[104]   A September 1961 prison report argues that secondnameplaceholder "appears to have developed a certain amount of insight into his problems through his study of this discipline".[105]  Upon his release in 1967, secondnameplaceholder traveled to Los Angeles where he reportedly "met local Scientologists and attended several parties for movie stars".[106][107][108] secondnameplaceholder completed 150 hours of auditing.[109]   secondnameplaceholder's "right hand man", Bruce M. Davis,  worked at the Church of Scientology headquarters in London from November 1968 to April 1969."[110]In 2009, Los Angeles disk jockey Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating that he might be secondnameplaceholder's biological son. Roberts' biological mother claims that she was a member of the secondnameplaceholder Family who left in mid-1967 after being raped by secondnameplaceholder; she returned to her parents' home to complete the pregnancy, gave birth on March 22, 1968, and put Roberts up for adoption. CNN conducted a DNA test between Matthew Roberts and secondnameplaceholder's known biological grandson Jason Freeman in 2012, showing that Roberts and Freeman did not share DNA.[101] Roberts subsequently attempted to establish that secondnameplaceholder was his father through a direct DNA test which proved definitively that Roberts and secondnameplaceholder were not related.[111]In 2014, it was announced[by whom?] that the imprisoned secondnameplaceholder was engaged to 26-year-old Afton Elaine Burton and had obtained a marriage license on November 7.[112] secondnameplaceholder gave Burton the nickname "Star". She had been visiting him in prison for at least nine years and maintained several websites that proclaimed his innocence.[113] The wedding license expired on February 5, 2015, without a marriage ceremony taking place.[114] Journalist Daniel Simone reported that the wedding was cancelled after secondnameplaceholder discovered that Burton only wanted to marry him so that she and friend Craig Hammond could use his corpse as a tourist attraction after his death.[114][115] According to Simone, secondnameplaceholder believed that he would never die and may simply have used the possibility of marriage as a way to encourage Burton and Hammond to continue visiting him and bringing him gifts. Burton said on her website that the reason that the marriage did not take place was merely logistical. secondnameplaceholder was suffering from an infection and had been in a prison medical facility for two months and could not receive visitors. She said that she still hoped that the marriage license would be renewed and the marriage would take place.[114]On April 11, 2012, secondnameplaceholder was denied release at his 12th parole hearing, which he did not attend. After his March 27, 1997, parole hearing, secondnameplaceholder refused to attend any of his later hearings. The panel at that hearing noted that secondnameplaceholder had a "history of controlling behavior" and "mental health issues" including schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder, and was too great a danger to be released.[116] The panel also noted that secondnameplaceholder had received 108 rules violation reports, had no indication of remorse, no insight into the causative factors of the crimes, lacked understanding of the magnitude of the crimes, had an exceptional, callous disregard for human suffering and had no parole plans.[117] At the April 11, 2012, parole hearing, it was determined that secondnameplaceholder would not be reconsidered for parole for another 15 years, i.e. not before 2027, at which time he would have been 92 years old.[118]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
Beginning in January 1970, the left-wing newspapers Los Angeles Free Press and Tuesday's Child embraced secondnameplaceholder as a hero-figure, and Tuesday's Child proclaimed him "Man of the Year". In June 1970, Rolling Stone made him their cover story in "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: The Incredible Story of the Most Dangerous Man Alive".[119] A Rolling Stone writer visited the Los Angeles District Attorney's office while preparing that story,[120] and he was shocked by a photograph of the "Healter  [sic] Skelter" that secondnameplaceholder's disciples had written on a wall in their victim's blood.[121] Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi pointed out the dispute in the underground press over whether secondnameplaceholder was "Christ returned" or "a sick symbol of our times".[citation needed]Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground reportedly said of the Tate murders: "Dig it, first they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach. Wild!"[122] Neo-Nazi and secondnameplaceholder follower James Mason founded the Universal Order, a group that has influenced other movements such as the neo-Nazi terrorist group the Atomwaffen Division. The Universal Order's name and logo is a swastika between the scales of justice, remotely designed by secondnameplaceholder.[clarification needed] Bugliosi quoted a BBC employee's assertion that a "neo-secondnameplaceholder cult" existed in Europe, represented by approximately 70 rock bands playing songs by secondnameplaceholder and "songs in support of him".[75]secondnameplaceholder was a struggling musician, seeking to make it big in Hollywood between 1967 and 1969. The Beach Boys did a cover of one of his songs.  Other songs were publicly released only after the trial for the Tate murders started. On March 6, 1970, LIE, an album of secondnameplaceholder music, was released.[123][124][125][126] This included "Cease to Exist", a secondnameplaceholder composition the Beach Boys had recorded with modified lyrics and the title "Never Learn Not to Love".[127][128] Over the next couple of months only about 300 of the album's 2,000 copies sold.[129]There have been several other releases of secondnameplaceholder recordings – both musical and spoken. One of these, The Family Jams, includes two compact discs of secondnameplaceholder's songs recorded by the Family in 1970, after secondnameplaceholder and the others had been arrested. Guitar and lead vocals are supplied by Steve Grogan;[130][failed verification] additional vocals are supplied by Lynette Fromme, Sandra Good, Catherine Share, and others.[citation needed] One Mind, an album of music, poetry, and spoken word, new at the time of its release, in April 2005, was put out under a Creative Commons license.[131][132]American rock band Guns N' Roses recorded secondnameplaceholder's "Look at Your Game, Girl", included as an unlisted 13th track on their 1993 album "The Spaghetti Incident?"[75][failed verification][133][134] "My Monkey", which appears on Portrait of an American Family by the American rock band Marilyn secondnameplaceholder, includes the lyrics "I had a little monkey / I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread / Along came a choo-choo / Knocked my monkey cuckoo / And now my monkey's dead." These lyrics are from secondnameplaceholder's "Mechanical Man",[135] which is heard on LIE. Crispin Glover covered "Never Say 'Never' to Always" on his album The Big Problem ≠ The Solution. The Solution=Let It Be released in 1989.Musical performers such as Kasabian,[136] Spahn Ranch,[137] and Marilyn secondnameplaceholder[138] derived their names from secondnameplaceholder and his lore.Legal documentsNews articles

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (Serbian Cyrillic: Цвјетко Поповић; 1896 – 9 June 1980)[1] was a Bosnian Serb who was involved in the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.
<h2>Early life and assassination</h2>
He was born in what is modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was an 18-year-old student, studying in Sarajevo when Danilo Ilić recruited him and his friend, Vaso Čubrilović, to help assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand.[2]Nikola Pašić, the prime minister of the Kingdom of Serbia, heard about the plot and gave instructions for the three men to be arrested. However, his orders were not implemented and the three men arrived in Bosnia and Herzegovina where they joined forces with fellow conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, Miško Jovanović and Vaso's brother Veljko Čubrilović.On Sunday 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and Sophie von Chotek were assassinated by Gavrilo Princip. Princip and Nedeljko Čabrinović were captured and interrogated by the police. They eventually gave the names of their fellow conspirators. Muhamed Mehmedbašić managed to escape to Serbia but secondnameplaceholder, Ilić, Jovanović, and the Čubrilović brothers were arrested and charged with treason and murder.All the men were found guilty. Under Austro-Hungarian law, an offender under the age of 20 could not be executed. Nedjelko Čabrinović, Gavrilo Princip and Trifko Grabež therefore received the maximum penalty of twenty years, whereas Vaso Čubrilović were sentenced to 16 years and secondnameplaceholder to 13 years prison at Terezín.[3]secondnameplaceholder was released when the Allies defeated the Central Powers in November 1918, having served four years of his 13-year sentence.
<h2>Later life</h2>
After his release from prison at the end of World War I, secondnameplaceholder returned to teaching as a professor of philosophy and eventually became Curator of the Ethnographic Department of the Sarajevo Museum.[4]The night before the 50th anniversary of the killing of the Archduke in 1964, secondnameplaceholder attended a lecture about the assassination in Sarajevo, but did not attend any of the events throughout the city, commemorating the anniversary.[5] He was quoted as saying that he would not have taken part in the assassination had he known it would lead to war.[6]Marking the 55th anniversary of the event in June 1969, secondnameplaceholder, then aged 73, gave an interview recalling the assassination.[7][8]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder died in Sarajevo on 9 June 1980 at the age of 84, leaving Vaso Čubrilović as the sole surviving assassin. Čubrilović died 10 years and two days later on 11 June 1990 at age 93.

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (1810 – February 19, 1841) was a Spanish-born Portuguese serial killer. Between 1836 and 1840, he killed seventy people.[1] The crimes he committed were all in the area of the Águas Livres Aqueduct, thus earning the title "Aqueduct Murderer". He was sentenced to death and hanged on February 19, 1841. The head of the killer was separated from the body and placed in a flask to preserve it for scientific purposes, where it is now a tourist attraction.[2]The murders on the aqueduct remained unproven, but the jury sentenced secondnameplaceholder and his gang for other crimes, in particular, murdering the four family members of a doctor. Maria's 11-year-old daughter, Maria da Conceicão, testified in court against the gang. Her mother was eventually sent to a lifelong exile in the Portuguese African colonies.secondnameplaceholder became the penultimate (often mistakenly claimed to be the last) hanged criminal in Portugal. His actions at the time intrigued scientists from the then Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon. After his hanging, in an attempt to study his brain, secondnameplaceholder' head was cut off and studied. To this day it is still preserved in a glass vessel, where a solution of formaldehyde has perpetuated the image of a calm man—quite contrary to what he really was. Scientists could never explain what led him to buy a false key for the Aqueducts, where he was hiding, and how many people he had robbed and killed. The severed head is currently in the anatomical theater of the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Medicine, following the formation of a phrenology cabinet made by José Lourenço da Luz Gomes, which allowed the preservation of secondnameplaceholder' skull, along with that of Matos Lobo (being one of the last subjects to whom the death penalty in Portugal was applied, something quite significant for the judicial history of Portugal) in the old medical-surgical school. The head of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was one of the most significant—and undoubtedly horrific—objects of the passage in One hundred pieces for the Museum of Medicine, which took place in the National Museum of Ancient Art in 2005.
Biography
Born in Galicia in a peasant family, secondnameplaceholder fell from the family horse while at a young age and hit his head, earning the nickname Pancada ("blow"). At the age of nineteen, his parents sent him to work in Lisbon. After changing several jobs and ceasing to write to his parents, he began to drink and gamble, meeting up with innkeeper Maria "Parreirinha" Gertrudes. It is believed that this connection instigated secondnameplaceholder to kill. He began to commit crimes, earning a second nickname "The Aqueduct Murderer". He robbed poor passers-by, and then dumped them from a height of 60 meters to simultaneously avoid identification and present the deaths as suicides, which he initially succeeded in.

firstnameplaceholderward Theodore secondnameplaceholder (/ɡiːn/; August 27, 1906[1] – July 26, 1984), also known as the Butcher of Plainfield or the Plainfield Ghoul, was an American convicted murderer and body snatcher. secondnameplaceholder's crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety in 1957 after authorities discovered he had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies and keepsakes from their bones and skin. secondnameplaceholder also confessed to killing two women: tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954 and hardware store owner Bernice Worden in 1957.secondnameplaceholder was initially found unfit to stand trial and confined to a mental health facility. By 1968, he was judged competent to stand trial; he was found guilty of the murder of Worden,[2] but he was found legally insane and was remanded to a psychiatric institution. He died at Mendota Mental Health Institute of respiratory failure, on July 26, 1984, aged 77. He is buried next to his family in the Plainfield Cemetery, in a now-unmarked grave.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, on August 27, 1906,[1] the second of two boys of George Philip secondnameplaceholder (1873–1940[3]) and Augusta Wilhelmine (née Lehrke) secondnameplaceholder (1878–1945).[4] secondnameplaceholder had an elder brother, Henry George secondnameplaceholder (1901–1944).[5]Augusta hated her husband, an alcoholic who was unable to keep a job; he had worked at various times as a carpenter, tanner and insurance salesman. George owned a local grocery shop for a few years but sold the business, and the family left the city to live in isolation on a 155-acre (63-hectare) farm in the town of Plainfield, Wisconsin,[6] which became the secondnameplaceholder family's permanent residence.[7] Augusta took advantage of the farm's isolation by turning away outsiders who could have influenced her sons.[7] secondnameplaceholder left the farm only to attend school.Outside of school, secondnameplaceholder spent most of his time doing chores on the farm. Augusta was fervently religious, and nominally Lutheran.[8] She preached to her boys about the innate immorality of the world, the evil of drinking, and her belief that all women (apart from herself) were naturally promiscuous and instruments of the devil. She reserved time every afternoon to read to them from the Bible, usually selecting verses from the Old Testament and Book of Revelation concerning death, murder and divine retribution.[8]secondnameplaceholder was shy, and classmates and teachers remembered him as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, as if he were laughing at his own personal jokes. To make matters worse, Augusta punished him whenever he tried to make friends. Despite his poor social development, secondnameplaceholder did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.[7]On April 1, 1940, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's father George died of heart failure caused by his alcoholism, at age 66. Henry and firstnameplaceholder began doing odd jobs around town to help cover living expenses. The brothers were generally considered reliable and honest by residents of the community. While both worked as handymen, firstnameplaceholder also frequently babysat for neighbors. He enjoyed babysitting, seeming to relate more easily to children than adults. Henry began dating a divorced mother of two and planned to move in with her; he worried about his brother's attachment to their mother and often spoke ill of her around firstnameplaceholder, who responded with shock and hurt.[7]On May 16, 1944, Henry and firstnameplaceholder were burning away marsh vegetation on the property;[9] the fire got out of control, drawing the attention of the local fire department. By the end of the day—the fire having been extinguished and the firefighters gone—firstnameplaceholder reported his brother missing. With lanterns and flashlights, a search party searched for Henry, whose dead body was found lying face down.[10] Apparently, he had been dead for some time, and it appeared that the cause of death was heart failure since he had not been burned or injured otherwise.[10]It was later reported, by biographer Harold Schechter, that Henry had bruises on his head.[11][12][13] The police dismissed the possibility of foul play and the county coroner later officially listed asphyxiation as the cause of death.[7][12][13] The authorities accepted the accident theory, but no official investigation was conducted and an autopsy was not performed.[14] Questioning firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder about the death of Bernice Worden in 1957, state investigator Joe Wilimovsky brought up questions about Henry's death.[9] George W. Arndt, who studied the case, wrote that, in retrospect, it was "possible and likely" that Henry's death was "the 'Cain and Abel' aspect of this case".[15][16]secondnameplaceholder and his mother were now alone. Augusta had a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and secondnameplaceholder devoted himself to taking care of her. Sometime in 1945, secondnameplaceholder later recounted, he and his mother visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to purchase straw. According to secondnameplaceholder, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith home came outside and yelled for him to stop but Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene; however, what bothered her did not appear to be the brutality toward the dog but, rather, the presence of the woman. Augusta told firstnameplaceholder that the woman was not married to Smith, so she had no business being there. "Smith's harlot", Augusta angrily called her. She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly.[17] She died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67. firstnameplaceholder was devastated by her death; in the words of author Harold Schechter, he had "lost his only friend and one true love. And he was absolutely alone in the world."[12][13]
<h2>Work</h2>
secondnameplaceholder held on to the farm and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, including the upstairs, downstairs parlor, and living room, leaving them untouched. While the rest of the house became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. secondnameplaceholder lived thereafter in a small room next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading pulp magazines and adventure stories, particularly those involving cannibals or Nazi atrocities.[7]secondnameplaceholder was a handyman and received a farm subsidy from the federal government starting in 1951. He occasionally worked for the local municipal road crew and crop-threshing crews in the area. Sometime between 1946 and 1956, he also sold an 80-acre (32 ha) parcel of land that his brother Henry had owned.[18]
<h2>Crimes</h2>
On the morning of November 16, 1957, Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden disappeared. A Plainfield resident reported that the hardware store's truck had been driven out from the rear of the building at around 9:30 a.m. The hardware store saw few customers the entire day; some area residents believed this was because of deer hunting season.[3] Bernice Worden's son, Deputy Sheriff Frank Worden, entered the store around 5:00 p.m. to find the store's cash register open and blood stains on the floor.[19]Frank Worden told investigators that on the evening before his mother's disappearance, secondnameplaceholder had been in the store, and that he was to have returned the next morning for a gallon of antifreeze. A sales slip for a gallon of antifreeze was the last receipt written by Worden on the morning she disappeared.[20] On the evening of the same day, secondnameplaceholder was arrested at a West Plainfield[a] grocery store,[21] and the Waushara County Sheriff's Department searched the secondnameplaceholder farm.[19]A Waushara County Sheriff's deputy[19] discovered Worden's decapitated body in a shed on secondnameplaceholder's property, hung upside down by her legs with a crossbar at her ankles and ropes at her wrists. The torso was "dressed out like a deer".[22][23] She had been shot with a .22-caliber rifle, and the mutilations were made after her death.[24]Searching the house, authorities found:[25]These artifacts were photographed at the state crime laboratory and then "decently disposed of".[37]When questioned, secondnameplaceholder told investigators that between 1947 and 1952,[38] he made as many as 40 nocturnal visits to three local graveyards to exhume recently buried bodies while he was in a "daze-like" state. On about 30 of those visits, he said he came out of the daze while in the cemetery, left the grave in good order, and returned home empty-handed.[39] On the other occasions, he dug up the graves of recently buried middle-aged women he thought resembled his mother[40] and took the bodies home, where he tanned their skins to make his paraphernalia.[41]secondnameplaceholder admitted to stealing from nine graves from local cemeteries [42][43] and led investigators to their locations. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by secondnameplaceholder. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about two feet (61 centimeters) below the surface in sandy soil. secondnameplaceholder had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. The test graves were exhumed because authorities were uncertain as to whether the slight secondnameplaceholder was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening; they were found as secondnameplaceholder described: two of the exhumed graves were found empty (one had a crowbar in place of the body). One casket was empty; one casket secondnameplaceholder had failed to open when he lost his pry bar; and most of the body was gone from the third grave, yet secondnameplaceholder had returned rings and some body parts,[37][44][45]. Thus, secondnameplaceholder's confession was largely corroborated.[42][46][47]Soon after his mother's death, secondnameplaceholder began to create a "woman suit" so that "he could become his mother—to literally crawl into her skin".[25] secondnameplaceholder denied having sex with the bodies he exhumed, explaining: "They smelled too bad."[48] During state crime laboratory interrogation, secondnameplaceholder also admitted to the shooting death of Mary Hogan, a tavern owner missing since 1954 whose head was found in his house, but he later denied memory of details of her death.[49]A 16-year-old youth, whose parents were friends of secondnameplaceholder and who attended ball games and movies with him, reported that secondnameplaceholder kept shrunken heads in his house, which secondnameplaceholder had described as relics from the Philippines, sent by a cousin who had served on the islands during World War II.[50] Upon investigation by the police, these were determined to be human facial skins, carefully peeled from corpses and used by secondnameplaceholder as masks.[51]secondnameplaceholder was also considered a suspect in several other unsolved cases in Wisconsin, including the 1953 disappearance of Evelyn Hartley, a La Crosse babysitter.[52][53][54][55]During questioning, Waushara County sheriff Art Schley reportedly assaulted secondnameplaceholder by banging his head and face into a brick wall. As a result, secondnameplaceholder's initial confession was ruled inadmissible.[12][13][56][57][58][59] Schley died of heart failure at age 43 in 1968 before secondnameplaceholder's trial.[59] Many who knew Schley said he was traumatized by the horror of secondnameplaceholder's crimes, and this, along with the fear of having to testify (especially about assaulting secondnameplaceholder), caused his death. One of his friends said: "He was a victim of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder as surely as if he had butchered him."[12][13]On November 21, 1957, secondnameplaceholder was arraigned on one count of first degree murder in Waushara County Court, where he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.[60] secondnameplaceholder was diagnosed with schizophrenia and found mentally incompetent, thus unfit for trial. He was sent to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane (now the Dodge Correctional Institution), a maximum-security facility in Waupun, Wisconsin, and later transferred to the Mendota State Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin.[61]In 1968, doctors determined secondnameplaceholder was "mentally able to confer with counsel and participate in his defense".[62] The trial began on November 7, 1968,[63][64][65][66][67] and lasted one week. A psychiatrist testified that secondnameplaceholder had told him that he did not know whether the killing of Bernice Worden was intentional or accidental. secondnameplaceholder had told him that while he examined a gun in Worden's store, the gun went off, killing Worden.[68] secondnameplaceholder testified that after trying to load a bullet into the rifle, it discharged. He said he had not aimed the rifle at Worden, and did not remember anything else that happened that morning.[69]At the request of the defense, secondnameplaceholder's trial was held without a jury,[67] with Judge Robert H. Gollmar presiding. secondnameplaceholder was found guilty by Gollmar on November 14.[2] A second trial dealt with secondnameplaceholder's sanity;[2] after testimony by doctors for the prosecution and defense, Gollmar ruled secondnameplaceholder "not guilty by reason of insanity" and ordered him committed to Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.[70] secondnameplaceholder spent the rest of his life in a mental hospital.[2][71] Judge Gollmar wrote, "Due to prohibitive costs, secondnameplaceholder was tried for only one murder—that of Mrs. Worden. He also admitted to killing Mary Hogan."[72]secondnameplaceholder's house and 195-acre (79 ha) property were appraised at $4,700 (equivalent to $42,000 in 2020).[73] His possessions were scheduled to be auctioned on March 30, 1958, amidst rumors that the house and the land it stood on might become a tourist attraction. Early on the morning of March 20, the house was destroyed by fire. A deputy fire marshal reported that a garbage fire had been set 75 feet (23 m) from the house by a cleaning crew who were given the task of disposing of refuse, that hot coals were recovered from the spot of the bonfire, but that the fire did not spread along the ground from that location to the house.[73] Arson was suspected, but the cause of the fire was never officially determined.[74] It is possible that the fire was not considered a matter of urgency by fire chief Frank Worden, son of Bernice Worden, secondnameplaceholder's last victim.[75] When secondnameplaceholder learned of the incident while in detention, he shrugged and said, "Just as well."[76]secondnameplaceholder's 1949 Ford sedan, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 (equivalent to $6,800 in 2020) to carnival sideshow operator Bunny Gibbons.[77] Gibbons charged carnival-goers 25¢ admission to see it.[78]
<h2>Death</h2>
secondnameplaceholder died at the Mendota Mental Health Institute due to respiratory failure secondary to lung cancer on July 26, 1984, at the age of 77.[12][13] Over the years, souvenir seekers chipped pieces from his gravestone at the Plainfield Cemetery, until the stone itself was stolen in 2000. It was recovered in June 2001, near Seattle, Washington, and was placed in storage at the Waushara County Sheriff's Department. The gravesite itself is now unmarked, but not unknown; secondnameplaceholder is interred between his parents and brother in the cemetery.[79]
<h2>In popular culture</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's story has had a lasting effect on American popular culture as evident by its numerous appearances in film, music and literature. The tale first came to widespread public attention in the fictionalized version presented by Robert Bloch in his 1959 suspense novel, Psycho. In addition to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film of Bloch's novel, Psycho,[80] secondnameplaceholder's story was loosely adapted into numerous films, including Deranged (1974),[80] In the Light of the Moon (2000) (released in the United States and Australia as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (2001)), firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: The Butcher of Plainfield (2007), "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, the Musical" (2010), and the Rob Zombie films House of 1000 Corpses and its sequel, The Devil's Rejects. secondnameplaceholder served as the inspiration for myriad fictional serial killers, most notably Norman Bates (Psycho), Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre),[80] Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)[80] and the character Dr. Oliver Thredson in the TV series American Horror Story: Asylum.[81]American filmmaker Errol Morris and German filmmaker Werner Herzog attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate on a film project about secondnameplaceholder from 1975 to 1976. Morris interviewed secondnameplaceholder several times and ended up spending almost a year in Plainfield interviewing dozens of locals. The pair planned secretly to exhume secondnameplaceholder's mother from her grave to test a theory, but never followed through on the scheme and eventually ended their collaboration. The aborted project was described in a 1989 New Yorker profile of Morris.[82]The character Patrick Bateman, in the 1991 novel American Psycho and its 2000 film adaptation, mistakenly attributes a quote by firstnameplaceholdermund Kemper to secondnameplaceholder, saying: "You know what firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder said about women? ... He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right ... [the other part wonders] what her head would look like on a stick'."[83]In 2012, German director Jörg Buttgereit wrote and directed a stage play about the case of secondnameplaceholder called Kannibale und Liebe at Theater Dortmund in Germany. The part of secondnameplaceholder was played by actor Uwe Rohbeck.[84]At the time, the news reports of secondnameplaceholder's crimes spawned a subgenre of "black humor", called "secondnameplaceholderers".[85][86] Since the 1950s secondnameplaceholder has frequently been exploited by transgressive art or "shock rock", often without association with his life or crimes beyond the shock value of his name. Examples of this include the song titled "Dead Skin Mask" (1990) from Slayer's album Seasons in the Abyss, "Nothing to secondnameplaceholder" (2001) from Mudvayne's album L.D. 50, and, "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" (1992), from the Ziggens' album Rusty Never Sleeps.[87] There was also a band named firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (alternatively spelled firstnameplaceholder Thatch, c. 1680 – 22 November 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of Britain's North American colonies. Little is known about his early life, but he may have been a sailor on privateer ships during Queen Anne's War before he settled on the Bahamian island of New Providence, a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold, whose crew secondnameplaceholder joined around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop that he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet; but Hornigold retired from piracy toward the end of 1717, taking two vessels with him.secondnameplaceholder captured a French slave ship known as La Concorde, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, equipped her with 40 guns, and crewed her with over 300 men. He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses (slow matches) under his hat to frighten his enemies.  He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, ransoming the port's inhabitants. He then ran Queen Anne's Revenge aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina.  He parted company with Bonnet and settled in Bath, North Carolina, also known as Bath Town, where he accepted a royal pardon.  But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood, the Governor of Virginia.  Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to capture him; on 22 November 1718 following a ferocious battle secondnameplaceholder and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard.secondnameplaceholder was a shrewd and calculating leader who spurned the use of violence, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response that he desired from those whom he robbed. He was romanticized after his death and became the inspiration for an archetypal pirate in works of fiction across many genres.
<h2>Early life</h2>
Little is known about Blackbeard's early life.  It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born in about 1680.[1][2]  In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, firstnameplaceholder Thatch or firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder; the latter is most often used.  Several spellings of his surname exist—Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche and Theach.  One early source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely.  Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and this makes it unlikely that secondnameplaceholder's real name will ever be known.[3][4]The 17th-century rise of Britain's American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of the Atlantic slave trade had made Bristol an important international sea port, and secondnameplaceholder was most likely raised in what was then the second-largest city in England. He could almost certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the Province of Carolina, Tobias Knight. The author Robert Lee speculated that secondnameplaceholder may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family.[5]  He may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a slave ship).[6]  The 18th-century author Charles Johnson claimed that secondnameplaceholder was for some time a sailor operating from Jamaica on privateer ships during the War of the Spanish Succession, and that "he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage".[7]  At what point during the war secondnameplaceholder joined the fighting is, in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.[8]
<h2>New Providence</h2>
With its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th- and 18th-century maritime incidents.  The privateer-turned-pirate Henry Jennings and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of New Providence as a base for their operations; it was within easy reach of the Florida Strait and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic.  New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships but was too shallow for the Royal Navy's larger vessels.  The author George Woodbury described New Providence as "no city of homes; it was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population," continuing, "The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on; all others were transient."[9] In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law.[10]secondnameplaceholder was one of those who came to enjoy the island's benefits. Probably shortly after the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, he moved there from Jamaica, and, along with most privateers once involved in the war, became involved in piracy. Possibly about 1716, he joined the crew of Captain Benjamin Hornigold, a renowned pirate who operated from New Providence's safe waters. In 1716 Hornigold placed secondnameplaceholder in charge of a sloop he had taken as a prize.[11] In early 1717, Hornigold and secondnameplaceholder, each captaining a sloop, set out for the mainland.  They captured a boat carrying 120 barrels of flour out of Havana, and shortly thereafter took 100 barrels of wine from a sloop out of Bermuda.  A few days later they stopped a vessel sailing from Madeira to Charles Town, South Carolina. secondnameplaceholder and his quartermaster, William Howard, may at this time have struggled to control their crews. By then they had probably developed a taste for Madeira wine, and on 29 September near Cape Charles all they took from the Betty of Virginia was her cargo of Madeira, before they scuttled her with the remaining cargo.[12]It was during this cruise with Hornigold that the earliest known report of secondnameplaceholder was made, in which he is recorded as a pirate in his own right, in command of a large crew. In a report made by a Captain Mathew Munthe on an anti-piracy patrol for North Carolina, "Thatch" was described as operating "a sloop 6 gunns  [sic] and about 70 men".[13] In September secondnameplaceholder and Hornigold encountered Stede Bonnet, a landowner and military officer from a wealthy family who had turned to piracy earlier that year. Bonnet's crew of about 70 were reportedly dissatisfied with his command, so with Bonnet's permission, secondnameplaceholder took control of his ship Revenge. The pirates' flotilla now consisted of three ships; secondnameplaceholder on Revenge, secondnameplaceholder's old sloop and Hornigold's Ranger. By October, another vessel had been captured and added to the small fleet.[14] The sloops Robert of Philadelphia and Good Intent of Dublin were stopped on 22 October 1717, and their cargo holds emptied.[15]As a former British privateer, Hornigold attacked only his old enemies, but for his crew, the sight of British vessels filled with valuable cargo passing by unharmed became too much, and at some point toward the end of 1717 he was demoted. Whether secondnameplaceholder had any involvement in this decision is unknown,[16] but Hornigold quickly retired from piracy. He took Ranger and one of the sloops, leaving secondnameplaceholder with Revenge and the remaining sloop.[17] The two never met again and, as did many other occupants of New Providence, Hornigold accepted the King's pardon from Woodes Rogers, in June the following year.[18]On 28 November 1717 secondnameplaceholder's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of Saint Vincent. They each fired a broadside across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender.[19] The ship was La Concorde, a large French Guineaman registered in Saint-Malo and carrying a cargo of slaves. This ship had originally been the English merchantman Concord, captured in 1711 by a French squadron, and then changed hands several times by 1717.[20] secondnameplaceholder and his crews sailed the vessel south along Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to Bequia, where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use. The crew of La Concorde were given the smaller of secondnameplaceholder's two sloops, which they renamed Mauvaise Rencontre (Bad Meeting), and sailed for Martinique. secondnameplaceholder may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of Mauvaise Rencontre.[21]secondnameplaceholder immediately renamed La Concorde as Queen Anne's Revenge and equipped her with 40 guns. By this time secondnameplaceholder had placed his lieutenant Richards in command of Bonnet's Revenge.[22] In late November, near Saint Vincent, he attacked the Great Allen. After a lengthy engagement, he forced the large and well-armed merchant ship to surrender. He ordered her to move closer to the shore, disembarked her crew and emptied her cargo holds, and then burned and sank the vessel. The incident was chronicled in the Boston News-Letter, which called secondnameplaceholder the commander of a "French ship of 32 Guns, a Briganteen of 10 guns and a Sloop of 12 guns." It is not known when or where secondnameplaceholder collected the ten-gun briganteen, but by that time he may have been in command of at least 150 men split among three vessels.[23][24]On 5 December 1717 secondnameplaceholder stopped the merchant sloop Margaret off the coast of Crab Island, near Anguilla. Her captain, Henry Bostock, and crew, remained secondnameplaceholder's prisoners for about eight hours, and were forced to watch as their sloop was ransacked. Bostock, who had been held aboard Queen Anne's Revenge, was returned unharmed to Margaret and was allowed to leave with his crew.[25] He returned to his base of operations on Saint Christopher Island and reported the matter to Governor Walter Hamilton, who requested that he sign an affidavit about the encounter. Bostock's deposition details secondnameplaceholder's command of two vessels: a sloop and a large French guineaman, Dutch-built, with 36 cannons and a crew of 300 men. The captain believed that the larger ship carried valuable gold dust, silver plate, and "a very fine cup" supposedly taken from the commander of Great Allen.[nb 1] secondnameplaceholder's crew had apparently informed Bostock that they had destroyed several other vessels, and that they intended to sail to Hispaniola and lie in wait for an expected Spanish armada, supposedly laden with money to pay the garrisons. Bostock also claimed that secondnameplaceholder had questioned him about the movements of local ships,[nb 2] but also that he had seemed unsurprised when Bostock told him of an expected royal pardon from London for all pirates.[28]Bostock's deposition describes secondnameplaceholder as a "tall spare man with a very black beard which he wore very long". It is the first recorded account of secondnameplaceholder's appearance and is the source of his cognomen, Blackbeard.[30] Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. Johnson (1724) described him as "such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful." Whether Johnson's description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that secondnameplaceholder understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one's enemies, than rely on bluster alone.[31] secondnameplaceholder was tall, with broad shoulders. He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet. Johnson also described secondnameplaceholder in times of battle as wearing "a sling over his shoulders, with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted slow matches under his hat",[29][nb 3] the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies.[33][34]  Despite his ferocious reputation though, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive.[nb 4]  secondnameplaceholder may have used other aliases; on 30 November, the Monserrat Merchant encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain firstnameplaceholders (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).[37]secondnameplaceholder's movements between late 1717 and early 1718 are not known.  He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off Sint Eustatius in December 1717.  Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled Samaná Bay in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity.  Captain Hume of HMS Scarborough (1711) reported on 6 February that a "Pyrate Ship of 36 Guns and 250 men, and a Sloop of 10 Guns and 100 men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands".  Hume reinforced his crew with soldiers armed with muskets, and joined up with HMS Seaford to track the two ships, to no avail, though they discovered that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off St Christopher Island, and reported also that they had last been seen "gone down the North side of Hispaniola".  Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by secondnameplaceholder and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were.[38]In March 1718, while taking on water at Turneffe Island east of Belize, both ships spotted the Jamaican logwood cutting sloop Adventure making for the harbour.  She was stopped and her captain, Harriot, invited to join the pirates.  Harriot and his crew accepted the invitation, and secondnameplaceholder sent over a crew to sail Adventure making Israel Hands the captain.[39] They sailed for the Bay of Honduras, where they added another ship and four sloops to their flotilla.[40][41]  On 9 April secondnameplaceholder's enlarged fleet of ships looted and burnt Protestant Caesar.  His fleet then sailed to Grand Cayman where they captured a "small turtler".[42]  secondnameplaceholder probably sailed toward Havana, where he may have captured a small Spanish vessel that had left the Cuban port.  They then sailed to the wrecks of the 1715 Spanish fleet, off the eastern coast of Florida.  There secondnameplaceholder disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop, before proceeding north to the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, attacking three vessels along the way.[43]By May 1718, secondnameplaceholder had awarded himself the rank of Commodore and was at the height of his power. Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina. All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no guard ship,[45] its pilot boat was the first to be captured. Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past Charles Town Bar, where secondnameplaceholder's fleet was anchored. One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the Crowley.  Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day. secondnameplaceholder informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt.[46]Wragg agreed to secondnameplaceholder's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given two days to collect the drugs. secondnameplaceholder moved his fleet, and the captured ships, to within about five or six leagues from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. secondnameplaceholder granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.[47]secondnameplaceholder kept to his side of the bargain and released the captured ships and his prisoners—albeit relieved of their valuables, including the fine clothing some had worn.[48]Whilst at Charles Town, secondnameplaceholder learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several men-of-war, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates.  secondnameplaceholder's flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), off the coast of North Carolina.  There they intended to careen their ships to scrape their hulls, but on 10 June 1718 the Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her main-mast and severely damaging many of her timbers.  secondnameplaceholder ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her.  A sloop commanded by Israel Hands of Adventure also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair,[49] leaving only Revenge and the captured Spanish sloop.[50]secondnameplaceholder had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it.  The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5 January.  Although in theory this left Bonnet and secondnameplaceholder at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions.  secondnameplaceholder thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain.[51]  Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat[nb 5] for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon.  He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the Revenge and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission.  Unfortunately for him, secondnameplaceholder had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him.  He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27 September 1718 at the mouth of the Cape Fear River.  All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.[53][nb 6]The author Robert Lee surmised that secondnameplaceholder and Hands intentionally ran the ships aground to reduce the fleet's crew complement, increasing their share of the spoils.  During the trial of Bonnet's crew, Revenge's boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that "the ship was run ashore and lost, which Thatch [secondnameplaceholder] caused to be done."[54]  Lee considers it plausible that secondnameplaceholder let Bonnet in on his plan to accept a pardon from Governor Eden.  He suggested that Bonnet do the same, and as war between the Quadruple Alliance of 1718 and Spain was threatening, to consider taking a privateer's commission from England.  Lee suggests that secondnameplaceholder also offered Bonnet the return of his ship Revenge.[55]  Konstam (2007) proposes a similar idea, explaining that secondnameplaceholder began to see Queen Anne's Revenge as something of a liability; while a pirate fleet was anchored, news of this was sent to neighbouring towns and colonies, and any vessels nearby would delay sailing.  It was prudent therefore for secondnameplaceholder not to linger for too long, although wrecking the ship was a somewhat extreme measure.[56]Before sailing northward on his remaining sloop to Ocracoke Inlet, secondnameplaceholder marooned about 25 men on a small sandy island about a league from the mainland.  He may have done this to stifle any protest they made, if they guessed their captain's plans.  Bonnet rescued them two days later.[57]  secondnameplaceholder continued on to Bath, where in June 1718—only days after Bonnet had departed with his pardon—he and his much-reduced crew received their pardon from Governor Eden.[58]He settled in Bath, on the eastern side of Bath Creek at Plum Point, near Eden's home.[nb 7]  During July and August he travelled between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke.  Johnson's account states that he married the daughter of a local plantation owner, although there is no supporting evidence for this.  Eden gave secondnameplaceholder permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer (a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement), and secondnameplaceholder was given official title to his remaining sloop, which he renamed Adventure.  By the end of August he had returned to piracy, and in the same month the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then secondnameplaceholder was probably operating in Delaware Bay, some distance away.  He took two French ships leaving the Caribbean, moved one crew across to the other, and sailed the remaining ship back to Ocracoke.[60]  In September he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea, deserted.  A Vice Admiralty Court was quickly convened, presided over by Tobias Knight and the Collector of Customs.  The ship was judged as a derelict found at sea, and of its cargo twenty hogsheads of sugar were awarded to Knight and sixty to Eden; secondnameplaceholder and his crew were given what remained in the vessel's hold.[61]Ocracoke Inlet was secondnameplaceholder's favourite anchorage.  It was a perfect vantage point from which to view ships travelling between the various settlements of northeast Carolina, and it was from there that secondnameplaceholder first spotted the approaching ship of Charles Vane, another English pirate.  Several months earlier Vane had rejected the pardon brought by Woodes Rogers and escaped the men-of-war the English captain brought with him to Nassau.  He had also been pursued by secondnameplaceholder's old commander, Benjamin Hornigold, who was by then a pirate hunter.  secondnameplaceholder and Vane spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island, accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands, Robert Deal and Calico Jack.[62]As it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of secondnameplaceholder and Vane's impromptu party worried the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates.[63]  They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina.  Some of secondnameplaceholder's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10 July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three.  As head of a Crown colony, Spotswood viewed the proprietary colony of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out.[64]Spotswood learnt that William Howard, the former quartermaster of Queen Anne's Revenge, was in the area, and believing that he might know of secondnameplaceholder's whereabouts had him and his two slaves arrested.  Spotswood had no legal authority to have pirates tried,[nb 8] and as a result, Howard's attorney, John Holloway, brought charges against Captain Brand of HMS Lyme, where Howard was imprisoned.  He also sued on Howard's behalf for damages of £500, claiming wrongful arrest.[66]Spotswood's council claimed that under a statute of William III the governor was entitled to try pirates without a jury in times of crisis and that secondnameplaceholder's presence was a crisis. The charges against Howard referred to several acts of piracy supposedly committed after the pardon's cut-off date, in "a sloop belonging to ye subjects of the King of Spain", but ignored the fact that they took place outside Spotswood's jurisdiction and in a vessel then legally owned.  Another charge cited two attacks, one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charles Town Bar, from which one of Howard's slaves was presumed to have come.  Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of Vice-Admiralty, on the charge of piracy, but Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of HMS Pearl) refused to serve with Holloway present.[nb 9]  Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the Attorney General of Virginia, John Clayton, whom Spotswood described as "an honester man [than Holloway]".[67]  Howard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, but was saved by a commission from London, which directed Spotswood to pardon all acts of piracy committed by surrendering pirates before 23 July 1718.[68][69]Spotswood had obtained from Howard valuable information on secondnameplaceholder's whereabouts,[70] and he planned to send his forces across the border into North Carolina to capture him.[71]  He gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina's Governor—firstnameplaceholder Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore.  He also wrote to the Lords of Trade, suggesting that the Crown might benefit financially from secondnameplaceholder's capture.  Spotswood personally financed the operation, possibly believing that secondnameplaceholder had fabulous treasures hidden away.  He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS Pearl and HMS Lyme to travel overland to Bath.  Lieutenant Robert Maynard of HMS Pearl was given command of two commandeered sloops, to approach the town from the sea.[nb 10]  An extra incentive for secondnameplaceholder's capture was the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia, over and above any that might be received from the Crown.[73]Maynard took command of the two armed sloops on 17 November.  He was given 57 men—33 from HMS Pearl and 24 from HMS Lyme.  Maynard and the detachment from HMS Pearl took the larger of the two vessels and named her Jane; the rest took Ranger, commanded by one of Maynard's officers, a Mister Hyde.  Some from the two ships' civilian crews remained aboard.  They sailed from Kecoughtan, along the James River, on 17 November.[74]  The two sloops moved slowly, giving Brand's force time to reach Bath.  Brand set out for North Carolina six days later, arriving within three miles of Bath on 23 November.  Included in Brand's force were several North Carolinians, including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, sent to counter any local objection to the presence of foreign soldiers.  Moore went into the town to see if secondnameplaceholder was there, reporting back that he was not, but that he was expected at "every minute."  Brand then went to Governor Eden's home and informed him of his purpose.  The next day, Brand sent two canoes down Pamlico River to Ocracoke Inlet, to see if secondnameplaceholder could be seen.  They returned two days later and reported on what eventually transpired.[75]Maynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of 21 November.[76]  He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but being unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack.  He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that secondnameplaceholder could not escape to sea.[77]  On the other side of the island, secondnameplaceholder was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout.  With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of Adventure's sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew.  Johnson (1724) reported secondnameplaceholder had "no more than twenty-five men on board" and that he "gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty".[78]  "Thirteen white and six Negroes", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.[79]At daybreak, preceded by a small boat taking soundings, Maynard's two sloops entered the channel.  The small craft was quickly spotted by Adventure and fired at as soon as it was within range of her guns.  While the boat made a quick retreat to the Jane, secondnameplaceholder cut the Adventure's anchor cable.  His crew hoisted the sails and the Adventure manoeuvred to point her starboard guns toward Maynard's sloops, which were slowly closing the gap.[82]  Hyde moved Ranger to the port side of Jane and the Union flag was unfurled on each ship.  Adventure then turned toward the beach of Ocracoke Island, heading for a narrow channel.[83]  What happened next is uncertain.  Johnson claimed that there was an exchange of small arms fire following which Adventure ran aground on a sandbar, and Maynard anchored and then lightened his ship to pass over the obstacle.  Another version claimed that Jane and Ranger ran aground, although Maynard made no mention of this in his log.[84]The Adventure eventually turned her guns on the two ships and fired.  The broadside was devastating; in an instant, Maynard had lost as much as a third of his forces.  About 20 on Jane were either wounded or killed and 9 on Ranger.  Hyde was dead and his second and third officers either dead or seriously injured.  His sloop was so badly damaged that it played no further role in the attack.[85] Contemporary accounts of what happened next are confused, but small-arms fire from Jane may have cut Adventure's jib sheet, causing her to lose control and run onto the sandbar.  In the aftermath of secondnameplaceholder's overwhelming attack, Jane and Ranger may also have been grounded; the battle would have become a race to see who could float their ship first.[86]Maynard had kept many of his men below deck, and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting.  secondnameplaceholder watched as the gap between the vessels closed,  and ordered his men to be ready.  The two vessels contacted one another as the Adventure's grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and ignited by fuses, broke across the sloop's deck.  As the smoke cleared, secondnameplaceholder led his men aboard, buoyant at the sight of Maynard's apparently empty ship, his men firing at the small group of men with Maynard at the stern.[87]The rest of Maynard's men then burst from the hold, shouting and firing.  The plan to surprise secondnameplaceholder and his crew worked; the pirates were apparently taken aback at the assault.  secondnameplaceholder rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck, which was already slick with blood from those killed or injured by secondnameplaceholder's broadside.  Maynard and secondnameplaceholder fired their flintlocks at each other, then threw them away.  secondnameplaceholder drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard's sword.  Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the Jane's crew to surround Maynard and secondnameplaceholder, who was by then completely isolated.[88]  As Maynard drew back to fire once again, secondnameplaceholder moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard's men.  Badly wounded, he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard's crew.  The remaining pirates quickly surrendered.  Those left on the Adventure were captured by the Ranger's crew, including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship.  Varying accounts exist of the battle's list of casualties; Maynard reported that 8 of his men and 12 pirates were killed.  Brand reported that 10 pirates and 11 of Maynard's men were killed.  Spotswood claimed ten pirates and ten of the King's men dead.[89]Maynard later examined secondnameplaceholder's body, noting that it had been shot five times and cut about twenty.  He also found several items of correspondence, including a letter from Tobias Knight.  secondnameplaceholder's corpse was thrown into the inlet and his head was suspended from the bowsprit of Maynard's sloop so that the reward could be collected.[90]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
Lieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead.[91]  secondnameplaceholder's loot—sugar, cocoa, indigo and cotton—found "in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay", was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight's barn, for £2,238.  Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation.  The prize money for capturing secondnameplaceholder was to have been about £400 (£63,000 in 2021)[92], but it was split between the crews of HMS Lyme and HMS Pearl.  As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives, Maynard thought this extremely unfair.  He lost much of any support he may have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £90 of secondnameplaceholder's booty.  The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years,[93][94] and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted, and faded into obscurity.[95]The remainder of secondnameplaceholder's crew and former associates were found by Brand, in Bath,[94] and were transported to Williamsburg, Virginia, where they were jailed on charges of piracy.  Several were black, prompting Spotswood to ask his council what could be done about "the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates."  Regardless, the men were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg's Capitol building, under admiralty law, on 12 March 1719.  No records of the day's proceedings remain, but 14 of the 16 accused were found guilty.  Of the remaining two, one proved that he had partaken of the fight out of necessity, having been on secondnameplaceholder's ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before, and not as a pirate.  The other, Israel Hands, was not present at the fight.  He claimed that during a drinking session secondnameplaceholder had shot him in the knee, and that he was still covered by the royal pardon.[nb 12]  The remaining pirates were hanged, then left to rot in gibbets along Williamsburg's Capitol Landing Road (known for some time after as "Gallows Road").[97]Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina,[98] and Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure.  He defended his actions, writing to Lord Carteret, a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests.  He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden "could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design", and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king.  Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with secondnameplaceholder and was accused of being his accomplice.  By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion.[99]  Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods.[100]  Eden doubtless shared the same view.  As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with secondnameplaceholder, on 4 April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning.  Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the Adventure in August 1718, shortly after secondnameplaceholder had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize.  Four pirates had testified that with secondnameplaceholder they had visited Knight's home to give him presents.  This testimony and the letter found on secondnameplaceholder's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence.  Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses.  He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law the other witness, an African, was unable to testify.  The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and secondnameplaceholder had visited him only on business, in his official capacity.  The board found Knight innocent of all charges.  He died later that year.[101][102]Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part.  The goods which Brand seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief.  The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until Eden's death on 17 March 1722.  His will named one of Spotswood's opponents, John Holloway, a beneficiary.  In the same year, Spotswood, who for years had fought his enemies in the House of Burgesses and the Council, was replaced by Hugh Drysdale, once Robert Walpole was convinced to act.[66][103]
<h2>Modern view</h2>
Official views on pirates were sometimes quite different from those held by contemporary authors, who often described their subjects as despicable rogues of the sea.  Privateers who became pirates were generally considered by the English government to be reserve naval forces, and were sometimes given active encouragement; as far back as 1581 Francis Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, when he returned to England from a round-the-world expedition with plunder worth an estimated £1,500,000.[105]  Royal pardons were regularly issued, usually when England was on the verge of war, and the public's opinion of pirates was often favourable, some considering them akin to patrons.[106] Economist Peter Leeson believes that pirates were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as barbarians.[104]  After Woodes Rogers' 1718 landing at New Providence and his ending of the pirate republic, piracy in the West Indies fell into terminal decline.  With no easily accessible outlet to fence their stolen goods, pirates were reduced to a subsistence livelihood, and following almost a century of naval warfare between the British, French and Spanish—during which sailors could find easy employment—lone privateers found themselves outnumbered by the powerful ships employed by the British Empire to defend its merchant fleets.  The popularity of the slave trade helped bring to an end the frontier condition of the West Indies, and in these circumstances, piracy was no longer able to flourish as it once did.[107]Since the end of this so-called golden age of piracy, secondnameplaceholder and his exploits have become the stuff of lore, inspiring books, films and even amusement park rides.  Much of what is known about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson's A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, published in Britain in 1724.[108]  A recognised authority on the pirates of his time, Johnson's descriptions of such figures as Anne Bonny and Mary Read were for years required reading for those interested in the subject.[109]  Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published, though author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson's entry on Blackbeard was "coloured a little to make a more sensational story."[nb 13] A General Historie, though, is generally considered to be a reliable source.[112][113]  Johnson may have been an assumed alias.  As Johnson's accounts have been corroborated in personal and official dispatches, Lee (1974) considers that whoever he was, he had some access to official correspondence.[109]  Konstam speculates further, suggesting that Johnson may have been the English playwright Charles Johnson, the British publisher Charles Rivington, or the writer Daniel Defoe.[113]  In his 1951 work The Great Days of Piracy, author George Woodbury wrote that Johnson is "obviously a pseudonym", continuing "one cannot help suspecting that he may have been a pirate himself."[114]Despite his infamy, secondnameplaceholder was not the most successful of pirates. Henry Every retired a rich man, and Bartholomew Roberts took an estimated five times the amount secondnameplaceholder stole.[116]  Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumoured hoard of gold and silver, but nothing found in the numerous sites explored along the east coast of the US has ever been connected to him.  Some tales suggest that pirates often killed a prisoner on the spot where they buried their loot, and secondnameplaceholder is no exception in these stories,[117] but that no finds have come to light is not exceptional; buried pirate treasure is often considered a modern myth for which almost no supporting evidence exists.  The available records include nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice, except in the imaginations of the writers of fictional accounts such as Treasure Island.  Such hoards would necessitate a wealthy owner, and their supposed existence ignores the command structure of a pirate vessel, in which the crew served for a share of the profit.[118]  The only pirate ever known to bury treasure was William Kidd;[119] the only treasure so far recovered from secondnameplaceholder's exploits is that taken from the wreckage of what is presumed to be the Queen Anne's Revenge, which was found in 1996.[120]  As of 2009 more than 250,000 artefacts had been recovered.[121]  A selection is on public display at the North Carolina Maritime Museum.[122]Various superstitious tales exist of secondnameplaceholder's ghost.  Unexplained lights at sea are often referred to as "secondnameplaceholder's light", and some recitals claim that the notorious pirate now roams the afterlife searching for his head, for fear that his friends, and the Devil, will not recognise him.[123]  A North Carolinian tale holds that secondnameplaceholder's skull was used as the basis for a silver drinking chalice; a local judge even claimed to have drunk from it one night in the 1930s.[124]The name of Blackbeard has been attached to many local attractions, such as Charleston's Blackbeard's Cove.[125]His name and persona have also featured heavily in literature.  He is the main subject of Matilda Douglas's fictional 1835 work Blackbeard: A page from the colonial history of Philadelphia.[126]Film renditions of his life include Blackbeard the Pirate (1952), Blackbeard's Ghost (1968), Blackbeard: Terror at Sea (2005) and the 2006 Hallmark Channel miniseries Blackbeard. Parallels have also been drawn between Johnson's Blackbeard and the character of Captain Jack Sparrow in the 2003 adventure film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.[127] Blackbeard is also portrayed as a central character in two recent TV series. In the short-lived Crossbones (2014), he is played by John Malkovich.[128] The British actor Ray Stevenson plays him in seasons three and four of Black Sails (2016–2017).[129]In 2015, the state government of North Carolina uploaded videos of the wreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge to its website without permission. As a result Nautilus Productions, the company documenting the recovery since 1998, filed suit in federal court over copyright violations and the passage of "Blackbeard's Law" by the North Carolina legislature.[130][131][132] Before posting the videos the North Carolina Legislature passed "Blackbeard's Law", N.C. Gen Stat §121-25(b), which stated, "All photographs, video recordings, or other documentary materials of a derelict vessel or shipwreck or its contents, relics, artifacts, or historic materials in the custody of any agency of North Carolina government or its subdivisions shall be a public record pursuant to Chapter 132 of the General Statutes." On 5 November 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Allen v. Cooper.[133][134][135][136] The Supreme Court subsequently ruled in the state's favor,[137] and struck down the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, which Congress passed in 1989 to attempt to curb such infringements of copyright by states, in Allen v. Cooper.[138][139]NotesCitationsBibliography

Countess firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder de Ecsed (Hungarian: secondnameplaceholder Erzsébet, pronounced [ˈbaːtori ˈɛrʒeːbɛt]; Slovak: Alžbeta Bátoriová ; 7 August 1560 – 21 August 1614)[1] was a Hungarian noblewoman from the family of secondnameplaceholder, who owned land in the Kingdom of Hungary (now Hungary, Slovakia and Romania).secondnameplaceholder has been labeled by Guinness World Records as the most prolific female murderer, though the number of her victims is debated.[2] secondnameplaceholder and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and women between 1590 and 1610.[3] The highest number of victims cited during secondnameplaceholder's trial was 650 but this number comes from the claim by a servant girl named Susannah that Jakab Szilvássy, secondnameplaceholder's court official, had seen the figure in one of secondnameplaceholder's private books. The book was never revealed and Szilvássy never mentioned it in his testimony.[4] Despite the evidence against secondnameplaceholder, her family's importance protected her from a death sentence. She was imprisoned in December 1610 within Castle of Csejte, in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia).The stories of secondnameplaceholder's sadistic serial murders are verified by the testimony of more than 300 witnesses and survivors as well as physical evidence and the presence of horribly mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest.[5] Stories describing secondnameplaceholder's vampiric tendencies, such as the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, were generally recorded years after her death, and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national folklore, and her infamy persists to this day.[6] Some insist she inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897),[7] though there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.[8] Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include The Blood Countess and Countess Dracula.
<h2>Early years</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on a family estate in Nyírbátor, Royal Hungary, in 1560 and spent her childhood at Ecsed Castle. Her father was Baron George VI secondnameplaceholder of the Ecsed branch of the family, brother of Andrew Bonaventura secondnameplaceholder, who had been voivode of Transylvania, while her mother was Baroness Anna secondnameplaceholder (1539–1570), daughter of Stephen secondnameplaceholder of Somlyó, another voivode of Transylvania, who was of the Somlyó branch. Through her mother, firstnameplaceholder was the niece of the Hungarian noble Stephen secondnameplaceholder (1533–1586), the king of Poland and the grand duke of Lithuania of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the prince of Transylvania. Her older brother was Stephen secondnameplaceholder (1555–1605), who became a judge royal of Hungary.As a child, secondnameplaceholder suffered multiple seizures that may have been caused by epilepsy, possibly stemming from the inbreeding of her parents.[9][10][11] At the time, symptoms relating to epilepsy were diagnosed as falling sickness and treatments included rubbing blood of a non-sufferer on the lips of an epileptic or giving the epileptic a mix of a non-sufferer's blood and piece of skull as their episode ended.[12][11] This has led to speculation that secondnameplaceholder's killings during her later life were part of her efforts to cure the illness she had been suffering from since childhood; however, there is no hard evidence supporting this speculation.[11]Another proposal made by some sources in order to explain secondnameplaceholder's cruelty later in her life is that she was trained by her family to be cruel.[13][11][10] Stories include a young secondnameplaceholder witnessing brutal punishments executed by her family's officers, and being taught by family members involved with Satanism and witchcraft.[10][13] Again, there is no hard evidence for these claims.secondnameplaceholder was raised a Calvinist Protestant. As a young woman, she learned Latin, German, Hungarian, and Greek.[3][14][9] Born into a privileged family of nobility, secondnameplaceholder was endowed with wealth, education, and a prominent social rank.At the age of 13, before her first marriage, secondnameplaceholder allegedly gave birth to a child.[15] The child, said to have been fathered by a peasant boy, was supposedly given away to a local woman who was trusted by the secondnameplaceholder family.[15] The woman was paid for her actions, and the child was taken to Wallachia.[15] Evidence of this pregnancy came up long after firstnameplaceholder's death through rumors spread by peasants; therefore, the validity of the rumor is often disputed.[11]
<h2>Married life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was engaged at age 10 to Count Ferenc Nádasdy, member of Nadasdy family, in what was probably a political arrangement within the circles of the aristocracy. He was the son of Baron Tamás Nádasdy de Nádasd et Fogarasföld and Orsolya Kanizsai.[16] As firstnameplaceholder's social standing was higher than that of her husband, she refused to change her last name, and instead, Nádasdy assumed the surname secondnameplaceholder. The couple married when she was 15 (and he was aged 19) at the palace of Vranov nad Topľou (Varannó in Hungarian) on 8 May 1575. Approximately 4,500 guests were invited to the wedding.[17]Nádasdy's wedding gift to secondnameplaceholder was his household, Castle of Csejte situated in the Little Carpathians near Vág-Ujhely and Trencsén (present-day Nové Mesto nad Váhom and Trenčín, Slovakia).[18] The castle had been bought by his mother in 1569 and given to Nádasdy, who transferred it to firstnameplaceholder during their nuptials,[16]:35 together with the Csejte country house and seventeen adjacent villages.[18]In 1578, Nádasdy became the chief commander of Hungarian troops, leading them to war against the Ottomans.[19] With her husband away at war, secondnameplaceholder managed business affairs and the estates. That role usually included responsibility for the Hungarian and Slovak people, even providing medical care.[20]During the Long War (1593–1606), secondnameplaceholder was charged with the defense of her husband's estates, which lay on the route to Vienna.[14] The threat was significant, for the village of Csejte had previously been plundered by the Ottomans while Sárvár, located near the border that divided Royal Hungary and Ottoman-occupied Hungary, was in even greater danger. There were several instances where secondnameplaceholder intervened on behalf of destitute women, including a woman whose husband was captured by the Ottomans and a woman whose daughter was raped and impregnated.[20]secondnameplaceholder's daughter, Anna Nádasdy, was born in 1585 and was later to become the wife of Nikola VI Zrinski. secondnameplaceholder's other known children include Orsolya (Orsika) Nádasdy (1590 – unknown) who would later become the wife of István II Benyó; Katalin (Kata or Katherina) Nádasdy (1594 – unknown); András Nádasdy (1596–1603); and Pál (Paul) Nádasdy (1598–1650), father of Franz III. Nádasdy, who was one of the leaders of the Magnate conspiracy against Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.[citation needed] Some chronicles also indicate that the couple had another son, named Miklós Nádasdy, although this cannot be confirmed, and it could be that he was simply a cousin or died young, as he is not named in secondnameplaceholder's will from 1610. György Nádasdy is also supposedly the name of one of the deceased Nádasdy infants, but nothing on that can be confirmed. All of firstnameplaceholder's children were cared for by governesses, as secondnameplaceholder had been.[21][22][23]Ferenc Nádasdy died on 4 January 1604 at the age of 48. Although the exact nature of the illness which led to his death is unknown, it seems to have started in 1601, and initially caused debilitating pain in his legs. From that time, he never fully recovered, and in 1603 became permanently disabled.[24] He had been married to secondnameplaceholder for 29 years. Before dying, Nádasdy entrusted his heirs and widow to György Thurzó, who would eventually lead the investigation into secondnameplaceholder's crimes.[16]
<h2>Accusation</h2>
Between 1602 and 1604, after rumors of secondnameplaceholder's atrocities had spread throughout the kingdom, Lutheran minister István Magyari made complaints against her, both publicly and at the court in Vienna.[25] The Hungarian authorities took some time to respond to Magyari's complaints. Finally, in 1610, King Matthias II assigned Thurzó, the Palatine of Hungary, to investigate. Thurzó ordered two notaries, András Keresztúry and Mózes Cziráky,[26] to collect evidence in March 1610.[27] By October 1610 they had collected 52 witness statements;[26] by 1611, that number had risen to over 300.According to the testimonies, secondnameplaceholder's first victims were girls aged 10 to 14 years.[28] Later, secondnameplaceholder is said to have begun killing daughters of the lesser gentry, who were sent to her gynaeceum by their parents to learn courtly etiquette. Abductions were said to have occurred as well.[29] The atrocities described most consistently included severe beatings; burning or mutilation of hands; biting the flesh off the faces, arms and other body parts; freezing or starving to death.[29] The use of needles was also mentioned by the collaborators in court. There were many suspected forms of torture carried out by secondnameplaceholder.[30] According to the Budapest City Archives, the girls were burned with hot tongs and then placed in freezing cold water.[30] They were also covered in honey and live ants.[30] secondnameplaceholder was also suspected of cannibalism.[30]Some witnesses named relatives who died while at the gynaeceum. Others reported having seen traces of torture on dead bodies, some of which were buried in graveyards, and others in unmarked locations. Two court officials (Benedek Deseő and Jakab Szilvássy) claimed to have personally witnessed the Countess torture and kill young servant girls.[16]:96–99On 12 December 1610, Nikola VI Zrinski confirmed the agreement with Thurzó about the imprisonment of secondnameplaceholder and distribution of the estate.[26] On 30 December, Thurzó went to Csejte Castle and arrested secondnameplaceholder along with four of her servants, who were accused of being her accomplices: Dorotya Semtész, Ilona Jó, Katarína Benická, and János Újváry ("Ibis" or Fickó). According to Thurzó's letter to his wife, his unannounced visit found one dead girl and another living "prey" girl in the castle,[26] but there is no evidence that they asked her what had happened to her. Although it is commonly believed that secondnameplaceholder was caught in the act of torture, she was having dinner. Initially, Thurzó made the declaration to secondnameplaceholder's guests and villagers that he had caught her red-handed. However, she was arrested and detained prior to the discovery or presentation of the victims. It seems most likely that the claim of Thurzó's discovering secondnameplaceholder covered in blood has been the embellishment of fictionalized accounts.[31]Thurzó debated further proceedings with secondnameplaceholder's son Paul and two of her sons-in-law, Nikola VI Zrinski and György Drugeth.[26] A trial and execution would have caused a public scandal, an influential family which ruled Transylvania would be disgraced, and firstnameplaceholder's considerable property would have been seized by the crown. Thurzó, along with Paul and her two sons-in-law, originally planned for secondnameplaceholder to be spirited away to a nunnery, but as accounts of her murder of the daughters of lesser nobility spread, it was agreed that she would be kept under strict house arrest and that further punishment should be avoided.[32]Most of the witnesses testified that they had heard the accusations from others, but did not see it themselves. The servants confessed under torture, which is not credible in contemporary proceedings. They were the king's witnesses, but they were executed quickly. The accusations of murder were based on rumors. There is no document to prove that anyone in the area complained about the Countess. In this time period, if someone was harmed, or someone even stole a chicken, a letter of complaint was written.[33][34][35] Two trials were held in the wake of secondnameplaceholder's arrest: the first was held on 2 January 1611, and the second on 7 January 1611.[36]
<h2>Prison and death</h2>
On 25 January 1611, Thurzó wrote in a letter to Hungarian King Matthias regarding the capture of the accused firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and her confinement in the castle. The palatine also coordinated the steps of the investigation with the political struggle with the Prince of Transylvania. The widow was detained in the castle of Csejte for the rest of her life, where she died at the age of 54. As György Thurzó wrote, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was locked in a bricked room, but according to other sources (written documents from the visit of priests, July 1614), she was able to move freely and unhindered in the castle, so today the bondage could be called house arrest.She wrote a will in September 1610, in which she left all current and future inheritance possession to her children.[26] In the last month of 1614, she signed her arrangement, in which she distributed the estates, lands, and possessions among her children.[37][38] On the evening of 20 August 1614, secondnameplaceholder complained to her bodyguard that her hands were cold, whereupon he replied "It's nothing, mistress. Just go lie down." She went to sleep and was found dead the following morning.[39] She was buried in the church of Csejte on 25 November 1614,[39] but according to some sources due to the villagers' uproar over having the Countess buried in their cemetery, her body was moved to her birth home at Ecsed, where it was interred at the secondnameplaceholder family crypt.[40] The location of her body today is unknown. The Csejte church or the castle of Csejte do not bear any markings of her possible grave.[citation needed]
<h2>Reputation</h2>
Several authors such as László Nagy and Dr. Irma Szádeczky-Kardoss have argued that firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was a victim of a conspiracy.[41][42] Nagy argued that the proceedings against secondnameplaceholder were largely politically motivated, possibly due to her extensive wealth and ownership of large areas of land in Hungary, escalating after the death of her husband. The theory is consistent with Hungarian history at that time, which included religious and political conflicts, especially relating to the wars with the Ottoman Empire, the spread of Protestantism and the extension of Habsburg power over Hungary.[43] Moreover, Matthias owed a large debt to secondnameplaceholder, which was cancelled after she was arrested.[1]There are counter-arguments made against this theory. The investigation into secondnameplaceholder's crimes was sparked by complaints from a Lutheran minister, István Magyari.[25] This does not contribute to the notion of a Catholic/Habsburg plot against the Protestant secondnameplaceholder, although religious tension is still a possible source of conflict as secondnameplaceholder was raised Calvinist, not Lutheran.[44] To support secondnameplaceholder's innocence, the testimony of around 300 witnesses[16]:96–99 and the physical evidence collected by the investigators have to be addressed or disputed. That evidence included numerous bodies and dead and dying girls found when the castle was entered by Thurzó.[5] Szádeczky-Kardoss argues the physical evidence was exaggerated and Thurzó misrepresented dead and wounded patients as victims of secondnameplaceholder, as disgracing her would greatly benefit his political state ambitions.[42]
<h2>Folklore and popular culture</h2>
The case of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder inspired numerous stories during the 18th and 19th centuries. The most common motif of these works was that of the countess bathing in her victims' blood to retain beauty or youth. This legend appeared in print for the first time in 1729, in the Jesuit scholar László Turóczi's Tragica Historia, the first written account of the secondnameplaceholder case.[45] The story came into question in 1817 when the witness accounts (which had surfaced in 1765) were published for the first time. They included no references to blood baths.[46] In his book Hungary and Transylvania, published in 1850, John Paget describes the supposed origins of secondnameplaceholder's blood-bathing, although his tale seems to be a fictionalized recitation of oral history from the area.[47] It is difficult to know how accurate his account of events is. Sadistic pleasure is considered a far more plausible motive for firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's crimes.[48]
(!!)Article(!/!)
Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (c.  1540 – 28 January 1596)[3] was an English explorer, sea captain, privateer, slave trader,[4] naval officer, and politician. secondnameplaceholder is best known for his circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580. This included his incursion into the Pacific Ocean, until then an area of exclusive Spanish interest, and his claim to New Albion for England, an area in what is now the U.S. state of California. His expedition inaugurated an era of conflict with the Spanish on the western coast of the Americas,[5] an area that had previously been largely unexplored by Western shipping.[6]Elizabeth I awarded secondnameplaceholder a knighthood in 1581 which he received on the Golden Hind in Deptford. In the same year he was appointed mayor of Plymouth. As a vice admiral, he was second-in-command of the English fleet in the victorious battle against the Spanish Armada in 1588. After unsuccessfully attacking San Juan, Puerto Rico, he died of dysentery in January 1596.[7]secondnameplaceholder's exploits made him a hero to the English, but his privateering led the Spanish to brand him a pirate, known to them as El Draque.[8] King Philip II of Spain allegedly offered a reward of 20,000 ducats for his capture or death,[9] about £6 million (US$8 million) in modern currency.[10]
<h2>Birth and early years</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born in Tavistock, Devon, England. Although his birth date is not formally recorded, it is known that he was born while the Six Articles were in force. His birth date is estimated from contemporary sources such as: "secondnameplaceholder was two and twenty when he obtained the command of the Judith"[11] (1566). This would date his birth to 1544. A date of c. 1540 is suggested from two portraits: one a miniature painted by Nicholas Hilliard in 1581 when he was allegedly 42, so born circa 1539, while the other, painted in 1594 when he was said to be 52,[12] would give a birth year of around 1541. Lady Elliott-secondnameplaceholder, the collateral descendant, and final holder of the secondnameplaceholder Baronetcy, argued in her book on 'The Family and Heirs of Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' that secondnameplaceholder's birth year was 1541.[13]He was the oldest of the twelve sons[14] of Edmund secondnameplaceholder (1518–1585), a Protestant farmer, and his wife Mary Mylwaye.  The first son was alleged to have been named after his godfather firstnameplaceholder Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.[15][16]Because of religious persecution during the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549, the secondnameplaceholder family fled from Devon to Kent. There secondnameplaceholder's father obtained an appointment to minister the men in the King's Navy.  He was ordained deacon and was made vicar of Upnor Church on the Medway.[17] secondnameplaceholder's father apprenticed him to his neighbour, the master of a barque used for coastal trade transporting merchandise to France.[17] The ship's master was so satisfied with the young secondnameplaceholder's conduct that, being unmarried and childless at his death, he bequeathed the barque to secondnameplaceholder.[when?] [17]
<h2>Marriage and family</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder married Mary Newman at St. Budeaux church, Plymouth, in July 1569.  She died 12 years later, in 1581.  In 1585, secondnameplaceholder married Elizabeth Sydenham—born circa 1562, the only child of Sir George Sydenham, of Combe Sydenham,[18] who was the High Sheriff of Somerset.[19] After secondnameplaceholder's death, the widow Elizabeth eventually married Sir William Courtenay of Powderham.[20]
<h2>Career at sea</h2>
In the 1550s, secondnameplaceholder's father found the young man a position with the owner and master of a small barque.  secondnameplaceholder likely engaged in commerce among England, the Low Countries and France.  On the death of the barque's owner, secondnameplaceholder was given the barque.[21]At the age of eighteen he was purser of a ship which sailed to the Bay of Biscay.[22]At twenty (c. 1563–1564) he made a voyage to the coast of Guinea in a ship owned by William and John Hawkins, some of his relatives from Plymouth.[23][22][24]In 1566–1567, secondnameplaceholder made his first voyage to the Americas, sailing under Captain John Lovell on one of a fleet of ships owned by the Hawkins family.  They attacked Portuguese settlements and slave ships on the coast of West Africa and then sailed to the Americas and sold the captured cargoes of enslaved Africans to Spanish plantations.[25] The voyage was largely unsuccessful and more than 90 enslaved Africans were released without payment.[26][27]secondnameplaceholder's second voyage to the Americas and his second slave trading voyage ended in the ill-fated 1568 incident at San Juan de Ulúa.[28][29][30]  Whilst negotiating to resupply and repair at a Spanish port in Mexico, the fleet was attacked by Spanish warships, with all but two of the English ships lost. He escaped along with John Hawkins, surviving the attack by swimming. secondnameplaceholder's hostility towards the Spanish is said to have started with this incident and he vowed revenge.[31]In 1570, his reputation enabled him to proceed to the West Indies with two vessels under his command. He renewed his visit the next year for the sole purpose of obtaining information.[22]In 1572, secondnameplaceholder embarked on his first major independent enterprise. He planned an attack on the Isthmus of Panama, known to the Spanish as Tierra Firme and the English as the Spanish Main.  This was the point at which the silver and gold treasure of Peru had to be landed and sent overland to the Caribbean Sea, where galleons from Spain would pick it up at the town of Nombre de Dios. secondnameplaceholder left Plymouth on 24 May 1572, with a crew of 73 men in two small vessels, the Pascha (70 tons) and the Swan (25 tons), to capture Nombre de Dios.[32]secondnameplaceholder's first raid was late in July 1572.  secondnameplaceholder formed an alliance with the Cimarrons.  secondnameplaceholder and his men captured the town and its treasure.  When his men noticed that secondnameplaceholder was bleeding profusely from a wound, they insisted on withdrawing to save his life and left the treasure.  secondnameplaceholder stayed in the area for almost a year, raiding Spanish shipping and attempting to capture a treasure shipment.The most celebrated of secondnameplaceholder's adventures along the Spanish Main was his capture of the Spanish Silver Train at Nombre de Dios in March 1573. He raided the waters around Darien (in modern Panama) with a crew including many French privateers including Guillaume Le Testu, a French buccaneer, and Maroons, enslaved Africans who had escaped from their Spanish slaveowners. One of these men was Diego, who under secondnameplaceholder became a free man; Diego was also a capable ship builder.[33] secondnameplaceholder tracked the Silver Train to the nearby port of Nombre de Dios. After their attack on the richly laden mule train, secondnameplaceholder and his party found that they had captured around 20 tons of silver and gold. They buried much of the treasure, as it was too much for their party to carry, and made off with a fortune in gold.[34][35] (An account of this may have given rise to subsequent stories of pirates and buried treasure). Wounded, Le Testu was captured and later beheaded. The small band of adventurers dragged as much gold and silver as they could carry back across some 18 miles of jungle-covered mountains to where they had left the raiding boats. When they got to the coast, the boats were gone. secondnameplaceholder and his men, downhearted, exhausted and hungry, had nowhere to go and the Spanish were not far behind.At this point, secondnameplaceholder rallied his men, buried the treasure on the beach, and built a raft to sail with two volunteers ten miles along the surf-lashed coast to where they had left the flagship.  When secondnameplaceholder finally reached its deck, his men were alarmed at his bedraggled appearance.  Fearing the worst, they asked him how the raid had gone. secondnameplaceholder could not resist a joke and teased them by looking downhearted. Then he laughed, pulled a necklace of Spanish gold from around his neck and said "Our voyage is made, lads!" By 9 August 1573, he had returned to Plymouth.It was during this expedition that secondnameplaceholder climbed a high tree in the central mountains of the Isthmus of Panama and thus became the first Englishman to see the Pacific Ocean. He remarked as he saw it that he hoped one day an Englishman would be able to sail it – which he would do years later as part of his circumnavigation of the world.[36]When secondnameplaceholder returned to Plymouth after the raids, the government signed a temporary truce with King Philip II of Spain and so was unable to acknowledge secondnameplaceholder's accomplishment officially. secondnameplaceholder was considered a hero in England and a pirate in Spain for his raids.[37]
<h2>Rathlin Island massacre</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was present at the 1575 Rathlin Island massacre in Ireland. Acting on the instructions of Sir Henry Sidney and the Earl of Essex, Sir John Norreys and secondnameplaceholder laid siege to Rathlin Castle. Despite their surrender, Norreys' troops killed all the 200 defenders and more than 400 civilian men, women and children of Clan MacDonnell.[38] Meanwhile, secondnameplaceholder was given the task of preventing any Gaelic Irish or Scottish reinforcements reaching the island. Therefore, the remaining leader of the Gaelic defence against English power, Sorley Boy MacDonnell, was forced to stay on the mainland. Essex wrote in his letter to Queen Elizabeth's secretary, that following the attack Sorley Boy "was likely to have run mad for sorrow, tearing and tormenting himself and saying that he there lost all that he ever had."[39]
<h2>Circumnavigation (1577–1580)</h2>
With the success of the Panama isthmus raid, in 1577 Elizabeth I of England sent secondnameplaceholder to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. secondnameplaceholder acted on the plan authored by Sir Richard Grenville, who had received royal patent for it in 1574. Just a year later the patent was rescinded after protests from Philip of Spain.Diego was once again employed under secondnameplaceholder; his fluency in Spanish and English would make him a useful interpreter when Spaniards or Spanish-speaking Portuguese were captured. He was employed as secondnameplaceholder's servant and was paid wages, just like the rest of the crew.[33] secondnameplaceholder and the fleet set out from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, but bad weather threatened him and his fleet. They were forced to take refuge in Falmouth, Cornwall, from where they returned to Plymouth for repair.[40]After this major setback, secondnameplaceholder set sail again on 13 December aboard Pelican with four other ships and 164 men. He soon added a sixth ship, Mary (formerly Santa Maria), a Portuguese merchant ship that had been captured off the coast of Africa near the Cape Verde Islands. He also added its captain, Nuno da Silva, a man with considerable experience navigating in South American waters.secondnameplaceholder's fleet suffered great attrition; he scuttled both Christopher and the flyboat Swan due to loss of men on the Atlantic crossing. He made landfall at the gloomy bay of San Julian, in what is now Argentina. Ferdinand Magellan had called here half a century earlier, where he put to death some mutineers. secondnameplaceholder's men saw weathered and bleached skeletons on the grim Spanish gibbets. Following Magellan's example, secondnameplaceholder tried and executed his own "mutineer" Thomas Doughty. The crew discovered that Mary had rotting timbers, so they burned the ship. secondnameplaceholder decided to remain the winter in San Julian before attempting the Strait of Magellan.[41]On his voyage to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets, secondnameplaceholder had several quarrels with his co-commander Thomas Doughty and on 3 June 1578, accused him of witchcraft and charged him with mutiny and treason in a shipboard trial.[42] secondnameplaceholder claimed to have a (never presented) commission from the Queen to carry out such acts and denied Doughty a trial in England. The main pieces of evidence against Doughty were the testimony of the ship's carpenter, Edward Bright, who after the trial was promoted to master of the ship Marigold, and Doughty's admission of telling Lord Burghley, a vocal opponent of agitating the Spanish, of the intent of the voyage. secondnameplaceholder consented to his request of Communion and dined with him, of which firstnameplaceholder Fletcher had this strange account:secondnameplaceholder had Thomas Doughty beheaded on 2 July 1578. When the ship's chaplain firstnameplaceholder Fletcher in a sermon suggested that the woes of the voyage in January 1580 were connected to the unjust demise of Doughty, secondnameplaceholder chained the clergyman to a hatch cover and pronounced him excommunicated.The three remaining ships of his convoy departed for the Magellan Strait at the southern tip of South America. A few weeks later (September 1578) secondnameplaceholder made it to the Pacific, but violent storms destroyed one of the three ships, the Marigold (captained by John Thomas) in the strait and caused another, the Elizabeth captained by John Wynter, to return to England, leaving only the Pelican. After this passage, the Pelican was pushed south and discovered an island that secondnameplaceholder called Elizabeth Island. secondnameplaceholder, like navigators before him, probably reached a latitude of 55°S (according to astronomical data quoted in Hakluyt's The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation of 1589) along the Chilean coast.[44] In the Magellan Strait firstnameplaceholder and his men engaged in skirmish with local indigenous people, becoming the first Europeans to kill indigenous peoples in southern Patagonia.[45] During the stay in the strait, crew members discovered that an infusion made of the bark of Drimys winteri could be used as remedy against scurvy. Captain Wynter ordered the collection of great amounts of bark – hence the scientific name.[45]Despite popular lore, it seems unlikely that secondnameplaceholder reached Cape Horn or the eponymous secondnameplaceholder Passage,[44] because his descriptions do not fit the first and his shipmates denied having seen an open sea.[citation needed] Historian Mateo Martinic, who examined his travels, credits secondnameplaceholder with the discovery of the "southern end of the Americas and the oceanic space south of it".[46] The first report of his discovery of an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego was written after the 1618 publication of the voyage of Willem Schouten and Jacob le Maire around Cape Horn in 1616.[47]secondnameplaceholder pushed onwards in his lone flagship, now renamed the Golden Hind in honour of Sir Christopher Hatton (after his coat of arms). The Golden Hind sailed north along the Pacific coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns. Some Spanish ships were captured, and secondnameplaceholder used their more accurate charts. Before reaching the coast of Peru, secondnameplaceholder visited Mocha Island, where he was seriously injured by hostile Mapuche. Later he sacked the port of Valparaíso further north in Chile, where he also captured a ship full of Chilean wine.[48]Near Lima, secondnameplaceholder captured a Spanish ship with 25,000 pesos of Peruvian gold, amounting in value to 37,000 ducats of Spanish money (about £7m by modern standards). secondnameplaceholder also discovered news of another ship, Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, which was sailing west towards Manila. It would come to be called the Cacafuego. secondnameplaceholder gave chase and eventually captured the treasure ship, which proved his most profitable capture.Aboard Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, secondnameplaceholder found 36 kilograms (80 lb) of gold, a golden crucifix, jewels, 13 chests full of royals of plate[clarification needed] and 26 thousand kilograms (26 long tons) of silver. secondnameplaceholder was naturally pleased at his good luck in capturing the galleon, and he showed it by dining with the captured ship's officers and gentleman passengers. He offloaded his captives a short time later, and gave each one gifts appropriate to their rank, as well as a letter of safe conduct.Prior to secondnameplaceholder's voyage, the western coast of North America had only been partially explored in 1542 by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo who sailed for Spain.[49] So, intending to avoid further conflict with Spain, secondnameplaceholder navigated northwest of Spanish presence and sought a discreet site at which the crew could prepare for the journey back to England.[50][51]On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at what is now South Cove, Cape Arago, just south of Coos Bay, Oregon, and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship.[52][53][54][55][56] On 17 June, secondnameplaceholder and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California.[57][58] While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as Nova Albion or New Albion.[59] To document and assert his claim, secondnameplaceholder posted an engraved plate of brass to claim sovereignty for Elizabeth and every successive English monarch.[60]
After erecting a fort and tents ashore, the crew labored for several weeks as they prepared for the circumnavigating voyage ahead by careening their ship, Golden Hind, so to effectively clean and repair the hull.[61]  secondnameplaceholder had friendly interactions with the Coast Miwok and explored the surrounding land by foot.[62] When his ship was ready for the return voyage, secondnameplaceholder and the crew left New Albion on 23 July and paused his journey the next day when anchoring his ship at the Farallon Islands where the crew hunted seal meat.[63][64][65]secondnameplaceholder left the Pacific coast, heading southwest to catch the winds that would carry his ship across the Pacific, and a few months later reached the Moluccas, a group of islands in the western Pacific, in eastern modern-day Indonesia. At this time Diego died from wounds he had sustained earlier in the voyage, secondnameplaceholder was saddened at his death having become a good friend.[33] Golden Hind later became caught on a reef and was almost lost. After the sailors waited three days for convenient tides and had dumped cargo. Befriending Sultan Babullah of Ternate in the Moluccas, secondnameplaceholder and his men became involved in some intrigues with the Portuguese there. He made multiple stops on his way toward the tip of Africa, eventually rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and reached Sierra Leone by 22 July 1580.On 26 September, Golden Hind sailed into Plymouth with secondnameplaceholder and 59 remaining crew aboard, along with a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures. The Queen's half-share of the cargo surpassed the rest of the crown's income for that entire year. secondnameplaceholder was hailed as the first Englishman to circumnavigate the Earth (and the second such voyage arriving with at least one ship intact, after Elcano's in 1520).[67]The Queen declared that all written accounts of secondnameplaceholder's voyages were to become the Queen's secrets of the Realm, and secondnameplaceholder and the other participants of his voyages on the pain of death sworn to their secrecy; she intended to keep secondnameplaceholder's activities away from the eyes of rival Spain. secondnameplaceholder presented the Queen with a jewel token commemorating the circumnavigation. Taken as a prize off the Pacific coast of Mexico, it was made of enamelled gold and bore an African diamond and a ship with an ebony hull.[67]For her part, the Queen gave secondnameplaceholder a jewel with her portrait, an unusual gift to bestow upon a commoner, and one that secondnameplaceholder sported proudly in his 1591 portrait by Marcus Gheeraerts now at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. On one side is a state portrait of Elizabeth by the miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard, on the other a sardonyx cameo of double portrait busts, a regal woman and an African male. The "secondnameplaceholder Jewel", as it is known today, is a rare documented survivor among sixteenth-century jewels; it is conserved at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.[67]Queen Elizabeth awarded secondnameplaceholder a knighthood aboard Golden Hind in Deptford on 4 April 1581; the dubbing being performed by a French diplomat, Monsieur de Marchaumont, who was negotiating for Elizabeth to marry the King of France's brother, firstnameplaceholder, Duke of Anjou.[68][69] By getting the French diplomat involved in the knighting, Elizabeth was gaining the implicit political support of the French for secondnameplaceholder's actions.[70][71][72] During the Victorian era, in a spirit of nationalism, the story was promoted that Elizabeth I had done the knighting.[69]After receiving his knighthood secondnameplaceholder unilaterally adopted the armorials of the ancient Devon family of secondnameplaceholder of Ash, near Musbury, to whom he claimed a distant but unspecified kinship. These arms were: Argent, a wyvern wings displayed and tail nowed gules,[73] and the crest, a dexter arm Proper grasping a battle axe Sable, headed Argent. The head of that family, also a distinguished sailor, Sir Bernard secondnameplaceholder (d.1586), angrily refuted Sir firstnameplaceholder's claimed kinship and his right to bear his family's arms. That dispute led to "a box on the ear" being given to Sir firstnameplaceholder by Sir Bernard at court, as recorded by John Prince (1643–1723) in his "Worthies of Devon", first published in 1701.[74] Queen Elizabeth, to assuage matters, awarded Sir firstnameplaceholder his own coat of arms, blazoned as follows:The motto, Sic Parvis Magna, translated literally, is: "Thus great things from small things (come)". The hand out of the clouds, labelled Auxilio Divino, means "With Divine Help".  The full achievement is depicted in the form of a large coloured plaster overmantel in the Lifetimes Gallery at Buckland Abbey[76]Nevertheless, secondnameplaceholder continued to quarter his new arms with the wyvern gules.[77] The arms adopted by his nephew Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, 1st Baronet (1588–1637) of Buckland were the arms of secondnameplaceholder of Ash, but the wyvern without a "nowed" (knotted) tail.[78]
<h2>Purchase of Buckland Abbey</h2>
In 1580, secondnameplaceholder purchased Buckland Abbey, a large manor house near Yelverton in Devon, via intermediaries from Sir Richard Greynvile. He lived there for fifteen years, until his final voyage, and it remained in his family for several generations. Buckland Abbey is now in the care of the National Trust and a number of mementos of his life are displayed there.
<h2>Political career</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was politically astute, and although known for his private and military endeavours, he was an influential figure in politics during the time he spent in Britain. Often abroad, there is little evidence to suggest he was active in Westminster, despite being a member of parliament on three occasions.After returning from his voyage of circumnavigation, secondnameplaceholder became the Mayor of Plymouth, in September 1581.[14] He became a member of parliament during a session of the 4th Parliament of Elizabeth I,[79] on 16 January 1581, for the constituency of Camelford. He did not actively participate at this point, and on 17 February 1581 he was granted leave of absence "for certain his necessary business in the service of Her Majesty".[80]secondnameplaceholder became a member of parliament again in 1584 for Bossiney[14] on the forming of the 5th Parliament of Elizabeth I.[81] He served the duration of the parliament and was active in issues regarding the navy, fishing, early American colonisation, and issues related chiefly to Devon. He spent the time covered by the next two parliamentary terms engaged in other duties and an expedition to Portugal.[80]
He became a member of parliament for Plymouth in 1593.[80] He was active in issues of interest to Plymouth as a whole, but also to emphasise defence against the Spanish.[80][82]
<h2>Great Expedition to America</h2>
War had already been declared by Phillip II after the Treaty of Nonsuch, so the Queen through firstnameplaceholder Walsingham ordered Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish colonies in a kind of preemptive strike. An expedition left Plymouth in September 1585 with secondnameplaceholder in command of twenty-one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. He first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. He then plundered Santiago in the Cape Verde islands after which the fleet then sailed across the Atlantic, sacked the port of Santo Domingo, and captured the city of Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia. At Cartagena, secondnameplaceholder released one hundred Turks who were enslaved.[83] On 6 June 1586, during the return leg of the voyage, he raided the Spanish fort of San Agustín in Spanish Florida.[84]After the raids he then went on to find Sir Walter Raleigh's settlement much further north at Roanoke which he replenished and also took back with him all of the original colonists before Sir Richard Greynvile arrived with supplies and more colonists. He finally reached England on 22 July, when he sailed into Portsmouth, England to a hero's welcome.[84]
<h2>Spanish Armada</h2>
Angered by these acts, Philip II ordered a planned invasion of England.On 15 March 1587, secondnameplaceholder accepted a new commission with several purposes:  disrupt the shipping routes to slow supplies from Italy and Andalusia to Lisbon, to trouble enemy fleets that were in their own ports, and to capture  Spanish ships laden with treasure.  secondnameplaceholder was also to confront and attack the Spanish Armada had it already sailed for England.[85] When arriving at Cadiz on 19 April, secondnameplaceholder found the harbour packed with ships and supplies as the Armada was readying and waiting for fair wind to launch the fleet to attack.[86] In the early hours of the next day, secondnameplaceholder pressed his attack into the inner harbour and inflicted heavy damage.[87] Claims of the Spanish ship losses vary.  secondnameplaceholder claimed he had sunk 39 ships, but other contemporary sources are lower, specifically some Spanish sources which suggest losses as low as 25 ships.[88] The attack became known as the “singeing of the King’s beard” and delayed the Spanish invasion by a year.[89]Over the next month, secondnameplaceholder patrolled the Iberian coasts between Lisbon and Cape St. Vincent, intercepting and destroying ships on the Spanish supply lines. secondnameplaceholder estimated that he captured around 1600–1700 tons of barrel staves, enough to make 25,000 to 30,000 barrels (4,800 m3) for containing provisions.[90]secondnameplaceholder was vice admiral in command of the English fleet (under Lord Howard of Effingham) when it overcame the Spanish Armada that was attempting to invade England in 1588. As the English fleet pursued the Armada up the English Channel in closing darkness, secondnameplaceholder broke off and captured the Spanish galleon Nuestra Señora del Rosario, along with Admiral Pedro de Valdés and all his crew. The Spanish ship was known to be carrying substantial funds to pay the Spanish Army in the Low Countries. secondnameplaceholder's ship had been leading the English pursuit of the Armada by means of a lantern. By extinguishing this for the capture, secondnameplaceholder put the fleet into disarray overnight.On the night of 29 July, along with Howard, secondnameplaceholder organised fire-ships, causing the majority of the Spanish captains to break formation and sail out of Calais into the open sea. The next day, secondnameplaceholder was present at the Battle of Gravelines. He wrote as follows to Admiral Henry Seymour after coming upon part of the Spanish Armada, whilst aboard Revenge on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 OS):[91]The most famous (but probably apocryphal) anecdote about secondnameplaceholder relates that, prior to the battle, he was playing a game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe. On being warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet, secondnameplaceholder is said to have remarked that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards, perhaps because he was waiting for high tide. There is no known eyewitness account of this incident and the earliest retelling of it was printed 37 years later.[41] Adverse winds and currents caused some delay in the launching of the English fleet as the Spanish drew nearer,[41] perhaps prompting a popular myth of secondnameplaceholder's cavalier attitude to the Spanish threat.  It might also have been later ascribed to the stoic attribute of British culture.In 1589, the year after defeating the Armada the English sent their own to attack Spain, secondnameplaceholder and Sir John Norreys were given three tasks: seek out and destroy the remaining ships, support the rebels in Lisbon, Portugal against King Philip II (then king of Spain and Portugal), and take the Azores if possible. In the Siege of Coruña secondnameplaceholder and Norreys destroyed a few ships in the harbour of A Coruña in Spain but lost more than 12,000 lives and 20 ships.[citation needed] This defeat in all fronts delayed secondnameplaceholder, and he was forced to forgo hunting the rest of the surviving ships and head on to Lisbon.[90]However, he wanted to change such a bitter thorn and, in order not to return empty-handed and with the morale of his troops sunk, he made a fleeting stop in the Galician rías, razing the defenseless town of Vigo to the ground without mercy for four days. His crew, without a government and eager for revenge, rampaged around the town until it was reduced to ashes. Even this abusive demonstration of power did not leave the corsair unharmed, as he lost some five hundred men on land, in addition to as many wounded. The growing defense of the inhabitants and the arrivals of militias from Portugal, put the ships in retreat again.After an investigation was opened in England to try to clarify the causes of the disaster, secondnameplaceholder, whose behavior was harshly criticized by his comrades in arms, was relegated to the modest post of commander of the coastal defenses of Plymouth, being denied the command of any naval expedition for the next six years.
<h2>Defeats and death</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's seafaring career continued into his mid-fifties. In 1595, he failed to conquer the port of Las Palmas, and following a disastrous campaign against Spanish America, where he suffered a number of defeats, he unsuccessfully attacked San Juan de Puerto Rico, eventually losing the Battle of San Juan.The Spanish gunners from El Morro Castle shot a cannonball through the cabin of secondnameplaceholder's flagship, but he survived. He attempted to attack over land in an effort to capture the rich port of Panamá but was defeated again. A few weeks later, on 28 January 1596, he died (aged about 56) of dysentery, a common disease in the tropics at the time, while anchored off the coast of Portobelo where some Spanish treasure ships had sought shelter.[93] Following his death, the English fleet withdrew defeated.[94]Before dying, he asked to be dressed in his full armour. He was buried at sea in a sealed lead-lined coffin, near Portobelo, a few miles off the coastline. It is supposed that his final resting place is near the wrecks of two British ships, the Elizabeth and the Delight, scuttled in Portobelo Bay. Divers continue to search for the coffin.[95][96]
<h2>Cultural impact</h2>
In Valparaíso, Chile, folklore associates a cave known as Cueva del Pirata (lit. "Cave of the Pirate") with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. A legend says that when secondnameplaceholder sacked the port he became disappointed over the scant plunder. secondnameplaceholder proceeded to enter the churches in fury to sack them and urinate on the goblets.[97] However he still found the plunder to be not worth enough to take it on board his galleon, hiding it in the cave.[97] Another version the legend says a treasure was left in the cave because the plunder had been more than he could take on board.[97] Together with the treasure secondnameplaceholder would have left a man chained or a sentry to wait for them to return, which they did not.[97] The treasure is said to still be there, but those who approach it drown.[97]Further north in Chile a tale says that because secondnameplaceholder feared falling prisoner to the Spanish he buried his treasure near Arica, these being one of many Chilean stories about entierros ("burrowings").[97]In the UK there are various places named after him, especially in Plymouth, Devon. Places there carrying his name include the naval base HMS secondnameplaceholder, secondnameplaceholder's Island, and a shopping centre and roundabout named secondnameplaceholder Circus. Plymouth Hoe is also home to a statue of secondnameplaceholder. The Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Channel is located in the British Virgin Islands.In northern California, there are several landmarks named after secondnameplaceholder, including the Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Hotel in San firstnameplaceholderco and Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Boulevard in Marin County, which extends from the Point Reyes Lighthouse at secondnameplaceholders Bay to Highway 580 near San Quentin State Prison. American historian Richard White noted that many of these efforts to name places after secondnameplaceholder were influenced by Anglo-Saxonism, a racialist ideology that was also responsible for influencing the manifest destiny ideology as well.[98]After the protests against police brutality and racism that followed the murder of George Floyd, memorials in California received public scrutiny as part of a worldwide reexamination of place names and monuments connected to racism. A high school which was named after secondnameplaceholder, the Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder High School in San Anselmo, California, formed the secondnameplaceholder Leadership Council to investigate the possibility of changing the school's name. After more than nine months of investigation, the Council voted 13-0, with one abstention on May 6, 2021 to change the name due to his involvement with the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism and piracy.[99][100][101][102][103] The school was renamed to Archie Williams High School, after former teacher and Olympic athlete Archie Williams. A statue of secondnameplaceholder in Larkspur, California was also removed by the city authorities, suspecting it would be targeted by protestors and citing safety concerns.[104][105] There is also a movement to rename Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Boulevard.[106]In British Columbia, Canada, where some theorise he may also have landed to the north of the usual site considered to be Nova Albion, various mountains were named in the 1930s for him, or in connection with Elizabeth I or other figures of that era, including Mount Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, Mount Queen Bess, and the Golden Hinde, the highest mountain on Vancouver Island.secondnameplaceholder's will was the focus of a vast confidence scheme which Oscar Hartzell perpetrated in the 1920s and 1930s.  He convinced thousands of people, mostly in the American Midwest, that secondnameplaceholder's fortune was being held by the British government, and had compounded to a huge amount. If their last name was secondnameplaceholder they might be eligible for a share if they paid Hartzell to be their agent. The swindle continued until a copy of secondnameplaceholder's will was brought to Hartzell's mail fraud trial and he was convicted and imprisoned.[107]secondnameplaceholder's Drum has become an icon of English folklore with its variation of the classic King asleep in mountain story motif.secondnameplaceholder was a major focus in the video game series Uncharted, specifically its first and third instalments, Uncharted: secondnameplaceholder's Fortune and Uncharted 3: secondnameplaceholder's Deception, respectively. The series follows Nathan secondnameplaceholder, a self-proclaimed descendant of secondnameplaceholder who retraces his ancestor's voyages.secondnameplaceholder was the subject of a TV series, Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (1961-1962). Terence Morgan played secondnameplaceholder in the 26-episode adventure drama.

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (Serbian Cyrillic: Гаврило Принцип, pronounced [ɡǎʋrilo prǐntsiːp]; 25 July 1894 – 28 April 1918) was a Bosnian Serb member of Young Bosnia who sought an end to Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the age of 19, he assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and the Archduke's wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. secondnameplaceholder and his accomplices were arrested and implicated as a nationalist secret society, which initiated the July Crisis and led to the outbreak of World War I.At his trial, secondnameplaceholder stated that: "I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be freed from Austria."[1] secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to twenty years in prison, the maximum for his age, and was imprisoned at the Terezín fortress. He died on 28 April 1918 from tuberculosis exacerbated by poor prison conditions which had already caused the loss of his right arm.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born in the remote hamlet of Obljaj, near Bosansko Grahovo, on 25 July [O.S. 13 July] 1894. He was the second of his parents' nine children, six of whom died in infancy. secondnameplaceholder's mother Marija wanted to name him after her late brother Špiro, but he was named firstnameplaceholder at the insistence of a local Eastern Orthodox priest, who claimed that naming the sickly infant after the Archangel Gabriel would help him survive.[2]A Serb family, the secondnameplaceholders had lived in northwestern Bosnia for many centuries[3] and adhered to the Serbian Orthodox Christian faith.[4] secondnameplaceholder's parents, Petar and Marija (née Mićić), were poor farmers who lived off the little land that they owned.[5] They belonged to a class of Christian peasants known as kmeti (serfs), who were often oppressed by their Muslim landlords.[6]Petar, who insisted on "strict correctness," never drank or swore and was ridiculed by his neighbours as a result.[5] In his youth, he fought in the Herzegovina Uprising against the Ottoman Empire.[7] Following the revolt, he returned to being a farmer in the Grahovo valley, where he worked approximately 4 acres (1.6 ha; 0.0063 sq mi) of land and was forced to give a third of his income to his landlord. In order to supplement his income and feed his family, he resorted to transporting mail and passengers across the mountains between northwestern Bosnia and Dalmatia.[8]Despite Petar's opposition, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder began attending primary school in 1903, aged nine. He overcame a difficult first year and became very successful in his studies, for which he was awarded a collection of Serbian epic poetry by his headmaster.[7] At the age of 13, secondnameplaceholder moved to Sarajevo, where his elder brother Jovan intended to enroll him into an Austro-Hungarian military school.[7] However, by the time secondnameplaceholder reached Sarajevo, Jovan had changed his mind after a friend advised him not to make firstnameplaceholder "an executioner of his own people." secondnameplaceholder was enrolled into a merchant school instead.[9] Jovan paid for his tuition with the money he earned performing manual labour, carrying logs from the forests surrounding Sarajevo to mills within the city.[10] After three years of study, firstnameplaceholder transferred to a local gymnasium.[9] In 1910, he came to revere Bogdan Žerajić, a Bosnian Serb revolutionary who attempted to assassinate Marijan Varešanin, the Austro-Hungarian Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, before taking his own life.[10] In 1911, secondnameplaceholder joined Young Bosnia (Serbian: Mlada Bosna), a society that wanted to separate Bosnia from Austria-Hungary and unite it with the neighbouring Kingdom of Serbia.[9] Because the local authorities had forbidden students to form organizations and clubs, secondnameplaceholder and other members of Young Bosnia met in secret. During their meetings, they discussed literature, ethics and politics.[10]In 1912, secondnameplaceholder was expelled from school for being involved in a demonstration against Austro-Hungarian authorities.[7] A student who witnessed the incident claimed that "secondnameplaceholder went from class to class, threatening with his knuckle-duster all the boys who wavered in coming to the new demonstrations."[11] secondnameplaceholder left Sarajevo shortly after being expelled and made the 280-kilometre (170 mi) journey to Belgrade on foot. According to one account, he fell to his knees and kissed the ground upon crossing the border into Serbia. In Belgrade, secondnameplaceholder volunteered to join the Serbian guerrilla bands fighting the Ottoman Turks, under the leadership of Major Vojislav Tankosić.[12] Tankosić was a member of the Black Hand, the foremost conspiratorial society in Serbia at the time.[9]At first, secondnameplaceholder was rejected at a recruitment office in Belgrade because of his small stature. Enraged, he tracked down Tankosić himself, who also told him that he was too small and weak.[13] Humiliated, secondnameplaceholder returned to Bosnia and lodged with his brother in Sarajevo. He spent the next several months moving back and forth between Sarajevo and Belgrade. In Belgrade he met Živojin Rafajlović, one of the founders of the Serbian Chetnik Organization, who sent him (along with 15 other Young Bosnia members) to the Chetnik training centre in Vranje.[14] There, they met with school manager Mihajlo Stevanović-Cupara. He lived in Cupara's house, which is today located on firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Street in Vranje. secondnameplaceholder practiced shooting, using bombs and the blade, after which training was completed and he returned to Belgrade.[15]In 1913, while secondnameplaceholder was staying in Sarajevo, Austria-Hungary declared a state of emergency, implemented martial law, seized control of all schools, and prohibited all Serb cultural organizations.[12]
<h2>Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</h2>
On 28 June 1914, secondnameplaceholder assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Duchess Sophie Chotek. The royal couple arrived in Sarajevo by train shortly before 10 a.m. and rode in the third car of a six-car motorcade towards Town Hall.[16] Their car's top was rolled back in order to allow the crowds a good view of its occupants.[17]secondnameplaceholder and the five other conspirators lined the route. They were spaced out along the Appel Quay, each one with instructions to assassinate the Archduke when the royal car reached their position. The first conspirator on the route to see the royal car was Muhamed Mehmedbašić. Standing by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, Mehmedbašić lost his nerve and allowed the car to pass without taking action. At 10:15 a.m., when the motorcade passed the central police station, nineteen-year-old student Nedeljko Čabrinović hurled a hand grenade at the Archduke's car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards him, and the bomb, which had a 10-second delay, exploded under the fourth car. Two of the occupants were seriously wounded.[18] After Čabrinović's failed attempt, the motorcade sped away and secondnameplaceholder and the remaining conspirators failed to act due to the motorcade's high speed.[19]After the Archduke gave his scheduled speech at Town Hall, he decided to visit the victims of Čabrinović's grenade attack at the Sarajevo Hospital.[20] In order to avoid the city centre, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the hospital. However, Potiorek forgot to inform the driver, Leopold Lojka, about this decision.[20] On the way to the hospital, Lojka incorrectly turned onto a side street where secondnameplaceholder had positioned himself in front of a local delicatessen. After realizing his mistake, Lojka braked and began to reverse. As he did so the engine stalled and the gears locked. secondnameplaceholder stepped forward, drew his FN Model 1910,[21][22] and at point-blank range fired twice into the car, first hitting the Archduke in the neck, and then hitting the Duchess in the abdomen.[23][24] They both died shortly after.[24]
<h2>Arrest and trial</h2>
secondnameplaceholder attempted to shoot himself, but the pistol was wrestled from his hand before he had a chance to fire another shot.[25] At his trial, he said he regretted the killing of the Duchess and meant to kill Potiorek, but was nonetheless proud of what he had done.[26][27] He further stated that: "I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be freed from Austria."[1] The Black Hand was implicated in the assassination which led Austria-Hungary to issue a démarche to Serbia known as the July Ultimatum which led up to the outbreak of World War I.[28]secondnameplaceholder was nineteen years old at the time and too young to receive the death penalty, as he was twenty-seven days shy of the twenty-year minimum age limit required by Habsburg Law.[29] Instead, he received the maximum sentence of twenty years in prison.[30]
<h2>Imprisonment and death</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was chained to a wall in solitary confinement at the Small Fortress in Terezín, where he lived in harsh conditions and suffered from tuberculosis.[31][28] The disease ate away his bones so badly that his right arm had to be amputated.[29] In January 1916, secondnameplaceholder unsuccessfully attempted to hang himself with a towel.[32] From February to June 1916, secondnameplaceholder met with Martin Pappenheim, a psychiatrist in the Austro-Hungarian army, four times.[32] Pappenheim wrote that secondnameplaceholder believed the World War was bound to happen, independent of his actions, and that he "cannot feel himself responsible for the catastrophe."[31]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder died on 28 April 1918, three years and ten months after the assassination. At the time of his death, weakened by malnutrition and disease, he weighed around 40 kilograms (88 lb; 6 st 4 lb).[33][34]Fearing his bones might become relics for Slavic nationalists, secondnameplaceholder's prison guards secretly took the body to an unmarked grave, but a Czech soldier assigned to the burial remembered the location, and in 1920 secondnameplaceholder and the other "Heroes of Vidovdan" were exhumed and brought to Sarajevo, where they were buried together beneath the Vidovdan Heroes Chapel "built to commemorate for eternity our Serb heroes" at the Holy Archangels Cemetery[35] which includes a citation from the Montenegrin poet Njegoš: "Blessed is he who lives forever. He had something to be born for."[36]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's legacy is still disputed. He is celebrated as a hero by Serbs but regarded as a terrorist by many Bosniaks.[37][38]In socialist Yugoslavia, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was venerated as a national hero and a freedom fighter who fought to liberate all the peoples of Yugoslavia from Austrian rule;[39] however, in the modern day, many Croats and Bosniaks have now expressed viewpoints characterizing secondnameplaceholder as a murderer.[39] Asim Sarajlić, a senior MP of the Bosniak nationalist Party of Democratic Action, stated that secondnameplaceholder brought an end to "a golden era of history under Austrian rule" and that "we are strongly against the mythology of secondnameplaceholder as a fighter of freedom."[39]However, Serbs continue to venerate his memory, with Nenad Samardžija, governor of East Sarajevo, saying that the assassination was not a terrorist act but "a movement of young people who wanted to liberate themselves from colonial slavery."[40] During the Yugoslavian era, Latin Bridge, the site of the assassination, was renamed secondnameplaceholder's Bridge in remembrance.[41][42]The house where secondnameplaceholder lived in Sarajevo was destroyed during World War I. After the war, it was rebuilt as a museum in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was conquered by Germany in 1941 and Sarajevo became part of the Independent State of Croatia. The Croatian Ustaše destroyed the house again. After the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia in 1944, the house of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder became a museum again and there was another museum dedicated to him within the city of Sarajevo.[36] During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, the house of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was destroyed and then rebuilt for the third time in 2015.[43]secondnameplaceholder's pistol was confiscated by the authorities and eventually given, along with the Archduke's bloody undershirt, to Anton Puntigam, a Jesuit priest who was a close friend of the Archduke and had given the Archduke and his wife their last rites. The pistol and shirt remained in the possession of the Austrian Jesuits until they were offered on long-term loan to the Museum of Military History in Vienna in 2004. It is now part of the permanent exhibition there.[44]There have been many short-lived memorials to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[45] In 1917, a pillar was constructed at the corner of where the assassination took place. It was destroyed the following year.[45] In the 1940s, a plaque commemorating secondnameplaceholder was removed when the German Army invaded,[45] and after World War II, a new plaque went up which claimed that "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder threw off the German occupiers."[45] During the Bosnian War, embossed footprints marking where secondnameplaceholder fired the fatal shots were torn out.[45]As the centenary of the assassination neared, a plaque at the corner where the assassination took place was put up, which states: "From this place on 28 June 1914, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia."[45][46] On 21 April 2014, a bust of secondnameplaceholder was unveiled in Tovariševo,[47] and on the centenary itself, a statue was erected in East Sarajevo.[48][49]A year later, a statue of secondnameplaceholder was unveiled in Belgrade by the President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolić and the President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik, as a gift from Republika Srpska to Serbia.[50] At the unveiling Nikolić gave a speech, saying in part: "secondnameplaceholder was a hero, a symbol of liberation ideas, tyrant-murderer, idea-holder of liberation from slavery, which spanned through Europe."[50]

firstnameplaceholder Luitpold secondnameplaceholder (German: [ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈluːɪtˌpɔlt ˈhɪmlɐ] (listen); 7 October 1900 – 23 May 1945) was Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Germany. secondnameplaceholder was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and a main architect of the Holocaust.As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, secondnameplaceholder did not see active service. He studied agronomy in university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed Reichsführer-SS by Adolf Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known for good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). He controlled the Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS. secondnameplaceholder held an interest in varieties of occultism and Völkisch topics, and he employed elements of these beliefs to develop the racial policy of Nazi Germany and incorporated esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS.secondnameplaceholder formed the Einsatzgruppen and built extermination camps. As overseer of the Nazi genocidal programs, secondnameplaceholder directed the killing of some six million Jews, between 200,000 and 500,000 Romani people, and other victims. The total number of civilians killed by the regime is estimated at eleven to fourteen million people. Most of them were Polish and Soviet citizens.Late in World War II, Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung). Specifically, he was given command of the Army Group Upper Rhine and the Army Group Vistula. After secondnameplaceholder failed to achieve his assigned objectives, Hitler replaced him in these posts. Realising the war was lost, secondnameplaceholder attempted to open peace talks with the western Allies without Hitler's knowledge, shortly before the end of the war. Hearing of this, Hitler dismissed him from all his posts in April 1945 and ordered his arrest. secondnameplaceholder attempted to go into hiding, but was detained and then arrested by British forces once his identity became known. While in British custody, he committed suicide on 23 May 1945.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder Luitpold secondnameplaceholder was born in Munich on 7 October 1900 into a conservative middle-class Roman Catholic family. His father was Joseph Gebhard secondnameplaceholder (17 May 1865 – 29 October 1936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria secondnameplaceholder (née Heyder; 16 January 1866 – 10 September 1941), a devout Roman Catholic. firstnameplaceholder had two brothers: Gebhard Ludwig (29 July 1898 – 22 June 1982) and Ernst Hermann (23 December 1905 – 2 May 1945).[3]secondnameplaceholder's first name, firstnameplaceholder, was that of his godfather, Prince firstnameplaceholder of Bavaria, a member of the royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard secondnameplaceholder.[4][5] He attended a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics.[6] He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.[7]secondnameplaceholder's diary, which he kept intermittently from the age of 10, shows that he took a keen interest in current events, dueling, and "the serious discussion of religion and sex".[8][9] In 1915, he began training with the Landshut Cadet Corps. His father used his connections with the royal family to get secondnameplaceholder accepted as an officer candidate, and he enlisted with the reserve battalion of the 11th Bavarian Regiment in December 1917. His brother, Gebhard, served on the western front and saw combat, receiving the Iron Cross and eventually being promoted to lieutenant. In November 1918, while secondnameplaceholder was still in training, the war ended with Germany's defeat, denying him the opportunity to become an officer or see combat. After his discharge on 18 December, he returned to Landshut.[10] After the war, secondnameplaceholder completed his grammar-school education. From 1919 to 1922, he studied agronomy at the Munich Technische Hochschule (now Technical University Munich) following a brief apprenticeship on a farm and a subsequent illness.[11][12]Although many regulations that discriminated against non-Christians—including Jews and other minority groups—had been eliminated during the unification of Germany in 1871, antisemitism continued to exist and thrive in Germany and other parts of Europe.[13] secondnameplaceholder was antisemitic by the time he went to university, but not exceptionally so; students at his school would avoid their Jewish classmates.[14] He remained a devout Catholic while a student and spent most of his leisure time with members of his fencing fraternity, the "League of Apollo", the president of which was Jewish. secondnameplaceholder maintained a polite demeanor with him and with other Jewish members of the fraternity, in spite of his growing antisemitism.[15][16] During his second year at university, secondnameplaceholder redoubled his attempts to pursue a military career. Although he was not successful, he was able to extend his involvement in the paramilitary scene in Munich. It was at this time that he first met Ernst Röhm, an early member of the Nazi Party and co-founder of the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Battalion"; SA).[17][18] secondnameplaceholder admired Röhm because he was a decorated combat soldier, and at his suggestion secondnameplaceholder joined his antisemitic nationalist group, the Bund Reichskriegsflagge (Imperial War Flag Society).[19]In 1922, secondnameplaceholder became more interested in the "Jewish question", with his diary entries containing an increasing number of antisemitic remarks and recording a number of discussions about Jews with his classmates. His reading lists, as recorded in his diary, were dominated by antisemitic pamphlets, German myths, and occult tracts.[20] After the murder of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau on 24 June, secondnameplaceholder's political views veered towards the radical right, and he took part in demonstrations against the Treaty of Versailles. Hyperinflation was raging, and his parents could no longer afford to educate all three sons. Disappointed by his failure to make a career in the military and his parents' inability to finance his doctoral studies, he was forced to take a low-paying office job after obtaining his agricultural diploma. He remained in this position until September 1923.[21][22]secondnameplaceholder joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923, receiving party number 14303.[23][24] As a member of Röhm's paramilitary unit, secondnameplaceholder was involved in the Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set secondnameplaceholder on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.[25][26]In 1923–24, secondnameplaceholder, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. secondnameplaceholder found the NSDAP appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of Führer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party,[27][28] and he later admired and even worshipped him.[29] To consolidate and advance his own position in the NSDAP, secondnameplaceholder took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch.[29] From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the NSDAP under Hitler when the party was re-founded in February 1925.[30][31]That same year, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) as an SS-Führer (SS-Leader); his SS number was 168.[24] The SS, initially part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA.[32] secondnameplaceholder's first leadership position in the SS was that of SS-Gauführer (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed secondnameplaceholder deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the NSDAP, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics on the number of Jews, Freemasons, and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy.[33][34] In September 1927, secondnameplaceholder told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit. Convinced that secondnameplaceholder was the man for the job, Hitler appointed him Deputy Reichsführer-SS, with the rank of SS-Oberführer.[35]Around this time, secondnameplaceholder joined the Artaman League, a Völkisch youth group. There he met Rudolf Höss, who was later commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp, and Walther Darré, whose book The Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race caught Hitler's attention, leading to his later appointment as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture. Darré was a firm believer in the superiority of the Nordic race, and his philosophy was a major influence on secondnameplaceholder.[32][36][37]
<h2>Rise in the SS</h2>
Upon the resignation of SS commander Erhard Heiden in January 1929, secondnameplaceholder assumed the position of Reichsführer-SS with Hitler's approval;[35][38][a] he still carried out his duties at propaganda headquarters. One of his first responsibilities was to organise SS participants at the Nuremberg Rally that September.[39] Over the next year, secondnameplaceholder grew the SS from a force of about 290 men to about 3,000. By 1930 secondnameplaceholder had persuaded Hitler to run the SS as a separate organisation, although it was officially still subordinate to the SA.[40][41]To gain political power, the NSDAP took advantage of the economic downturn during the Great Depression. The coalition government of the Weimar Republic was unable to improve the economy, so many voters turned to the political extreme, which included the NSDAP.[42] Hitler used populist rhetoric, including blaming scapegoats—particularly the Jews—for the economic hardships.[43] In September 1930, secondnameplaceholder was first elected as a deputy to the Reichstag.[44] In the 1932 election, the Nazis won 37.3 percent of the vote and 230 seats in the Reichstag.[45] Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933, heading a short-lived coalition of his Nazis and the German National People's Party. The new cabinet initially included only three members of the NSDAP: Hitler, Hermann Göring as minister without portfolio and Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Wilhelm Frick as Reich Interior Minister.[46][47] Less than a month later, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Hitler took advantage of this event, forcing von Hindenburg to sign the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial.[48] The Enabling Act, passed by the Reichstag in 1933, gave the Cabinet—in practice, Hitler—full legislative powers, and the country became a de facto dictatorship.[49]  On 1 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law which stipulated that upon von Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor.  Von Hindenburg died the next morning, and Hitler became both head of state and head of government under the title Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).[50]The Nazi Party's rise to power provided secondnameplaceholder and the SS an unfettered opportunity to thrive. By 1933, the SS numbered 52,000 members.[51] Strict membership requirements ensured that all members were of Hitler's Aryan Herrenvolk ("Aryan master race"). Applicants were vetted for Nordic qualities—in secondnameplaceholder's words, "like a nursery gardener trying to reproduce a good old strain which has been adulterated and debased; we started from the principles of plant selection and then proceeded quite unashamedly to weed out the men whom we did not think we could use for the build-up of the SS."[52] Few dared mention that by his own standards, secondnameplaceholder did not meet his own ideals.[53]secondnameplaceholder's organised, bookish intellect served him well as he began setting up different SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy.[54] The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect.[55] In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed secondnameplaceholder chief of the Munich Police. secondnameplaceholder appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police.[56] Thereafter, secondnameplaceholder and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.[57] Effective 1 January 1933, Hitler promoted secondnameplaceholder to the rank of SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in rank to the senior SA commanders.[58] On 2 June secondnameplaceholder, along with the heads of the other two Nazi paramilitary organizations, the SA and the Hitler Youth, was named a Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. On 10 July, he was named a Prussian State Councillor.[44]secondnameplaceholder further established the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt or RuSHA). He appointed Darré as its first chief, with the rank of SS-Gruppenführer. The department implemented racial policies and monitored the "racial integrity" of the SS membership.[59] SS men were carefully vetted for their racial background. On 31 December 1931, secondnameplaceholder introduced the "marriage order", which required SS men wishing to marry to produce family trees proving that both families were of Aryan descent to 1800.[60] If any non-Aryan forebears were found in either family tree during the racial investigation, the person concerned was excluded from the SS.[61] Each man was issued a Sippenbuch, a genealogical record detailing his genetic history.[62] secondnameplaceholder expected that each SS marriage should produce at least four children, thus creating a pool of genetically superior prospective SS members. The programme had disappointing results; less than 40 per cent of SS men married and each produced only about one child.[63]In March 1933, less than three months after the Nazis came to power, secondnameplaceholder set up the first official concentration camp at Dachau.[64] Hitler had stated that he did not want it to be just another prison or detention camp. secondnameplaceholder appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933.[65] Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany.[36] Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, secondnameplaceholder took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.[66][67]Initially the camps housed political opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were placed in the camps as well. In 1936 secondnameplaceholder wrote in the pamphlet "The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization" that the SS were to fight against the "Jewish-Bolshevik revolution of subhumans".[68] A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society.[69] This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.[70]In early 1934, Hitler and other Nazi leaders became concerned that Röhm was planning a coup d'état.[71] Röhm had socialist and populist views, and believed that the real revolution had not yet begun. He felt that the SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.[72]Göring had created a Prussian secret police force, the Geheime Staatspolizei or Gestapo in 1933, and appointed Rudolf Diels as its head. Göring, concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over its control to secondnameplaceholder on 20 April 1934.[73] Also on that date, Hitler appointed secondnameplaceholder chief of all German police outside Prussia. This was a radical departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter.  Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by secondnameplaceholder on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD.[74]Hitler decided on 21 June that Röhm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated. He sent Göring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with secondnameplaceholder and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where Röhm was arrested; he gave Röhm the choice to commit suicide or be shot. When Röhm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the Night of the Long Knives.[75][76] With the SA thus neutralised, the SS became an independent organisation answerable only to Hitler on 20 July 1934. secondnameplaceholder's title of Reichsführer-SS became the highest formal SS rank, equivalent to a field marshal in the army.[77] The SA was converted into a sports and training organisation.[78]On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws—known as the Nuremberg Laws—to the Reichstag. The laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households. The laws also deprived so-called "non-Aryans" of the benefits of German citizenship.[79] These laws were among the first race-based measures instituted by the Third Reich.secondnameplaceholder and Heydrich wanted to extend the power of the SS; thus, they urged Hitler to form a national police force overseen by the SS, to guard Nazi Germany against its many enemies at the time—real and imagined.[80] Interior Minister Frick also wanted a national police force, but one controlled by him, with Kurt Daluege as his police chief.[81] Hitler left it to secondnameplaceholder and Heydrich to work out the arrangements with Frick. secondnameplaceholder and Heydrich had greater bargaining power, as they were allied with Frick's old enemy, Göring. Heydrich drew up a set of proposals and secondnameplaceholder sent him to meet with Frick. An angry Frick then consulted with Hitler, who told him to agree to the proposals. Frick acquiesced, and on 17 June 1936 Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in the Reich, and named secondnameplaceholder Chief of German Police and a State Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior.[81] In this role, secondnameplaceholder was still nominally subordinate to Frick. In practice, however, the police was now effectively a division of the SS, and hence independent of Frick's control. This move gave secondnameplaceholder operational control over Germany's entire detective force.[81][82] He also gained authority over all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies, which were amalgamated into the new Ordnungspolizei (Orpo: "order police"), which became a branch of the SS under Daluege.[81]Shortly thereafter, secondnameplaceholder created the Kriminalpolizei (Kripo: criminal police) as the umbrella organisation for all criminal investigation agencies in Germany.  The Kripo was merged with the Gestapo into the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo: security police), under Heydrich's command.[83] In September 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, secondnameplaceholder formed the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA: Reich Security Main Office) to bring the SiPo (which included the Gestapo and Kripo) and the SD together under one umbrella. He again placed Heydrich in command.[84]Under secondnameplaceholder's leadership, the SS developed its own military branch, the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT), which later evolved into the Waffen-SS. Nominally under the authority of secondnameplaceholder, the Waffen-SS developed a fully militarised structure of command and operations. It grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, serving alongside the Heer (army), but never being formally part of it.[85]In addition to his military ambitions, secondnameplaceholder established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the umbrella of the SS.[86] To this end, administrator Oswald Pohl set up the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe (German Economic Enterprise) in 1940. Under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, this holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses.[87] Pohl was unscrupulous and quickly exploited the companies for personal gain. In contrast, secondnameplaceholder was honest in matters of money and business.[88]In 1938, as part of his preparations for war, Hitler ended the German alliance with China, and entered into an agreement with the more modern Japan. That same year, Austria was unified with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss, and the Munich Agreement gave Nazi Germany control over the Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia.[89] Hitler's primary motivations for war included obtaining additional Lebensraum ("living space") for the Germanic peoples, who were considered racially superior according to Nazi ideology.[90] A second goal was the elimination of those considered racially inferior, particularly the Jews and Slavs, from territories controlled by the Reich. From 1933 to 1938, hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. Some converted to Christianity.[91]According to secondnameplaceholder biographer Peter Longerich, secondnameplaceholder believed that a major task of the SS should be "acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living" as part of preparations for the coming conflict between "humans and subhumans".[92] Longerich wrote that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, "by linking de-Christianisation with re-Germanization, secondnameplaceholder had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own".[92] secondnameplaceholder was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the "principle of Christian mercy", both of which he saw as dangerous obstacles to his planned battle with "subhumans".[92] In 1937, secondnameplaceholder declared:In early 1937, secondnameplaceholder had his personal staff work with academics to create a framework to replace Christianity within the Germanic cultural heritage.  The project gave rise to the Deutschrechtlichte Institute, headed by Professor Karl Eckhardt, at the University of Bonn.[94]
<h2>World War II</h2>
When Hitler and his army chiefs asked for a pretext for the invasion of Poland in 1939, secondnameplaceholder, Heydrich, and firstnameplaceholder Müller masterminded and carried out a false flag project code-named Operation secondnameplaceholder. German soldiers dressed in Polish uniforms undertook border skirmishes which deceptively suggested Polish aggression against Germany. The incidents were then used in Nazi propaganda to justify the invasion of Poland, the opening event of World War II.[95] At the beginning of the war against Poland, Hitler authorised the killing of Polish civilians, including Jews and ethnic Poles. The Einsatzgruppen (SS task forces) had originally been formed by Heydrich to secure government papers and offices in areas taken over by Germany before World War II.[96] Authorised by Hitler and under the direction of secondnameplaceholder and Heydrich, the Einsatzgruppen units—now repurposed as death squads—followed the Heer (army) into Poland, and by the end of 1939 they had murdered some 65,000 intellectuals and other civilians. Militias and Heer units also took part in these killings.[97][98] Under secondnameplaceholder's orders via the RSHA, these squads were also tasked with rounding up Jews and others for placement in ghettos and concentration camps.Germany subsequently invaded Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, and France, and began bombing Great Britain in preparation for Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of the United Kingdom.[99] On 21 June 1941, the day before invasion of the Soviet Union, secondnameplaceholder commissioned the preparation of the Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East); the plan was finalised in July 1942. It called for the Baltic States, Poland, Western Ukraine, and Byelorussia to be conquered and resettled by ten million German citizens. The current residents—some 31 million people—would be expelled further east, starved, or used for forced labour. The plan would have extended the borders of Germany to the east by one thousand kilometres (600 miles). secondnameplaceholder expected that it would take twenty to thirty years to complete the plan, at a cost of 67 billion Reichsmarks.[100] secondnameplaceholder stated openly: "It is a question of existence, thus it will be a racial struggle of pitiless severity, in the course of which 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply."[101]secondnameplaceholder declared that the war in the east was a pan-European crusade to defend the traditional values of old Europe from the "Godless Bolshevik hordes".[102] Constantly struggling with the Wehrmacht for recruits, secondnameplaceholder solved this problem through the creation of Waffen-SS units composed of Germanic folk groups taken from the Balkans and eastern Europe. Equally vital were recruits from among the Germanic considered peoples of northern and western Europe, in the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Denmark and Finland.[103] Spain and Italy also provided men for Waffen-SS units.[104] Among western countries, the number of volunteers varied from a high of 25,000 from the Netherlands[105] to 300 each from Sweden and Switzerland. From the east, the highest number of men came from Lithuania (50,000) and the lowest from Bulgaria (600).[106] After 1943 most men from the east were conscripts. The performance of the eastern Waffen-SS units was, as a whole, sub-standard.[107]In late 1941, Hitler named Heydrich as Deputy Reich Protector of the newly established Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Heydrich began to racially classify the Czechs, deporting many to concentration camps. Members of a swelling resistance were shot, earning Heydrich the nickname "the Butcher of Prague".[108] This appointment strengthened the collaboration between secondnameplaceholder and Heydrich, and secondnameplaceholder was proud to have SS control over a state. Despite having direct access to Hitler, Heydrich's loyalty to secondnameplaceholder remained firm.[109]With Hitler's approval, secondnameplaceholder re-established the Einsatzgruppen in the lead-up to the planned invasion of the Soviet Union. In March 1941, Hitler addressed his army leaders, detailing his intention to smash the Soviet Empire and destroy the Bolshevik intelligentsia and leadership.[110] His special directive, the "Guidelines in Special Spheres re Directive No. 21 (Operation Barbarossa)", read: "In the operations area of the army, the Reichsführer-SS has been given special tasks on the orders of the Führer, in order to prepare the political administration. These tasks arise from the forthcoming final struggle of two opposing political systems. Within the framework of these tasks, the Reichsführer-SS acts independently and on his own responsibility."[111] Hitler thus intended to prevent internal friction like that occurring earlier in Poland in 1939, when several German Army generals had attempted to bring Einsatzgruppen leaders to trial for the murders they had committed.[111]Following the army into the Soviet Union, the Einsatzgruppen rounded up and killed Jews and others deemed undesirable by the Nazi state.[112] Hitler was sent frequent reports.[113] In addition, 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war died of starvation, mistreatment or executions in just eight months of 1941–42.[114] As many as 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps over the course of the war; most of them were shot or gassed.[115] By early 1941, following secondnameplaceholder's orders, ten concentration camps had been constructed in which inmates were subjected to forced labour.[116] Jews from all over Germany and the occupied territories were deported to the camps or confined to ghettos. As the Germans were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941, signalling that the expected quick defeat of the Soviet Union had failed to materialize, Hitler and other Nazi officials realised that mass deportations to the east would no longer be possible. As a result, instead of deportation, many Jews in Europe were destined for death.[117][118]
<h2>The Holocaust, racial policy, and eugenics</h2>
Nazi racial policies, including the notion that people who were racially inferior had no right to live, date back to the earliest days of the party; Hitler discusses this in Mein Kampf.[119] Somewhere around the time of the German declaration of war on the United States in December 1941, Hitler finally resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be "exterminated".[118] Heydrich arranged a meeting, held on 20 January 1942 at Wannsee, a suburb of Berlin. Attended by top Nazi officials, it was used to outline the plans for the "final solution to the Jewish question". Heydrich detailed how those Jews able to work would be worked to death; those unable to work would be killed outright. Heydrich calculated the number of Jews to be killed at 11 million and told the attendees that Hitler had placed secondnameplaceholder in charge of the plan.[120]In June 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in Prague in Operation Anthropoid, led by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile. Both men had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive for the mission to kill Heydrich.[121] During the two funeral services, secondnameplaceholder—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin.[122] On 9 June, after discussions with secondnameplaceholder and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death.[121] Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults in the village of Ležáky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads.[123][124] secondnameplaceholder took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing of Jews in Aktion Reinhard (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour.[125] He ordered the Aktion Reinhard camps—three extermination camps—to be constructed at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka.[126]Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by firing squad, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale.[127] In August 1941, secondnameplaceholder attended the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk. Nauseated and shaken by the experience,[128] he was concerned about the impact such actions would have on the mental health of his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found.[129][130] On his orders, by early 1942 the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded, including the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.[131] secondnameplaceholder visited the camp in person on 17 and 18 July 1942. He was given a demonstration of a mass killing using the gas chamber in Bunker 2 and toured the building site of the new IG Farben plant being constructed at the nearby town of Monowitz.[132] By the end of the war, at least 5.5 million Jews had been killed by the Nazi regime;[133] most estimates range closer to 6 million.[134][135] secondnameplaceholder visited the camp at Sobibór in early 1943, by which time 250,000 people had been killed at that location alone. After witnessing a gassing, he gave 28 people promotions and ordered the operation of the camp to be wound down. In a revolt that October, the remaining prisoners killed most of the guards and SS personnel. Several hundred prisoners escaped; about a hundred were immediately re-captured and killed. Some of those who managed to get away joined partisan units operating in the area. The camp was dismantled by December 1943.[136]The Nazis also targeted Romani (Gypsies) as "asocial" and "criminals".[137] By 1935, they were confined into special camps away from ethnic Germans.[137] In 1938, secondnameplaceholder issued an order in which he said that the "Gypsy question" would be determined by "race".[138] secondnameplaceholder believed that the Romani were originally Aryan but had become a mixed race; only the "racially pure" were to be allowed to live.[139] In 1939, secondnameplaceholder ordered thousands of Gypsies to be sent to the Dachau concentration camp and by 1942, ordered all Romani sent to Auschwitz concentration camp.[140]secondnameplaceholder was one of the main architects of the Holocaust,[141][142][143] using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. Longerich surmises that Hitler, secondnameplaceholder, and Heydrich designed the Holocaust during a period of intensive meetings and exchanges in April–May 1942.[144] The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education.[145] They further wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As an agronomist and farmer, secondnameplaceholder was acquainted with the principles of selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades of the end of the war.[146]On 4 October 1943, during a secret meeting with top SS officials in the city of Poznań (Posen), and on 6 October 1943, in a speech to the party elite—the Gau and Reich leaders—secondnameplaceholder referred explicitly to the "extermination" (German: Ausrottung) of the Jewish people.[147]A translated excerpt from the speech of 4 October reads:[148]Because the Allies had indicated that they were going to pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the ongoing genocide. Hitler therefore authorised secondnameplaceholder's speeches to ensure that all party leaders were complicit in the crimes and could not later deny knowledge of the killings.[147]As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) with the incorporated VoMi, secondnameplaceholder was deeply involved in the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.[151][152]secondnameplaceholder's racial groupings began with the Volksliste, the classification of people deemed of German blood. These included Germans who had collaborated with Germany before the war, but also those who considered themselves German but had been neutral; those who were partially "Polonized" but "Germanizable"; and Germans who were of Polish nationality.[153] secondnameplaceholder ordered that those who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour.[154][155] secondnameplaceholder's belief that "it is in the nature of German blood to resist" led to his conclusion that Balts or Slavs who resisted Germanization were racially superior to more compliant ones.[156] He declared that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind to mingle with an "alien race".[152]The plan also included the kidnapping of Eastern European children by Nazi Germany.[157] secondnameplaceholder urged:The "racially valuable" children were to be removed from all contact with Poles and raised as Germans, with German names.[157] secondnameplaceholder declared: "We have faith above all in this our own blood, which has flowed into a foreign nationality through the vicissitudes of German history. We are convinced that our own philosophy and ideals will reverberate in the spirit of these children who racially belong to us."[157] The children were to be adopted by German families.[155] Children who passed muster at first but were later rejected were taken to Kinder KZ in Łódź Ghetto, where most of them eventually died.[157]By January 1943, secondnameplaceholder reported that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans did not live in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, as well as from Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour.[159] secondnameplaceholder instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood.[160] In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).[161]
<h2>20 July plot</h2>
On 20 July 1944, a group of German army officers led by Claus von Stauffenberg and including some of the highest-ranked members of the German armed forces attempted to assassinate Hitler, but failed to do so. The next day, secondnameplaceholder formed a special commission that arrested over 5,000 suspected and known opponents of the regime. Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people.[162] Though secondnameplaceholder was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot, it led to an increase in his powers and authority.[163][164]General Friedrich Fromm, commander-in-chief of the Reserve (or Replacement) Army (Ersatzheer) and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one of those implicated in the conspiracy. Hitler removed Fromm from his post and named secondnameplaceholder as his successor. Since the Reserve Army consisted of two million men, secondnameplaceholder hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS. He appointed Hans Jüttner, director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy, and began to fill top Reserve Army posts with SS men. By November 1944 secondnameplaceholder had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.[165]By this time, Hitler had appointed secondnameplaceholder as Reichsminister of the Interior, succeeding Frick, and General Plenipotentiary for Administration (Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung).[166] At the same time (24 August 1943) he also joined the six-member Council of Ministers for Defense of the Reich, which operated as the war cabinet.[167] In August 1944 Hitler authorised him to restructure the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services. As head of the Reserve Army, secondnameplaceholder was now responsible for prisoners of war. He was also in charge of the Wehrmacht penal system, and controlled the development of Wehrmacht armaments until January 1945.[168]
<h2>Command of army group</h2>
On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France during Operation Overlord.[169] In response, Army Group Upper Rhine (Heeresgruppe Oberrhein) group was formed to engage the advancing US 7th Army (under command of General Alexander Patch[170]) and French 1st Army (led by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny) in the Alsace region along the west bank of the Rhine.[171] In late 1944, Hitler appointed secondnameplaceholder commander-in-chief of Army Group Upper Rhine.On 26 September 1944 Hitler ordered secondnameplaceholder to create special army units, the Volkssturm ("People's Storm" or "People's Army"). All males aged sixteen to sixty were eligible for conscription into this militia, over the protests of Armaments Minister Albert Speer, who noted that irreplaceable skilled workers were being removed from armaments production.[172] Hitler confidently believed six million men could be raised, and the new units would "initiate a people's war against the invader".[173] These hopes were wildly optimistic.[173] In October 1944, children as young as fourteen were being enlisted. Because of severe shortages in weapons and equipment and lack of training, members of the Volkssturm were poorly prepared for combat, and about 175,000 of them lost their lives in the final months of the war.[174]On 1 January 1945, Hitler and his generals launched Operation North Wind. The goal was to break through the lines of the US 7th Army and French 1st Army to support the southern thrust in the Battle of the Bulge (Ardennes offensive), the final major German offensive of the war. After limited initial gains by the Germans, the Americans halted the offensive.[175] By 25 January, Operation North Wind had officially ended.On 25 January 1945, despite secondnameplaceholder's lack of military experience, Hitler appointed him as commander of the hastily formed Army Group Vistula (Heeresgruppe Weichsel) to halt the Soviet Red Army's Vistula–Oder Offensive into Pomerania.[176] secondnameplaceholder established his command centre at Schneidemühl, using his special train, Sonderzug Steiermark, as his headquarters. The train had only one telephone line, inadequate maps, and no signal detachment or radios with which to establish communication and relay military orders. secondnameplaceholder seldom left the train, only worked about four hours per day, and insisted on a daily massage before commencing work and a lengthy nap after lunch.[177]General Heinz Guderian talked to secondnameplaceholder on 9 February and demanded, that Operation Solstice, an attack from Pomerania against the northern flank of Marshal Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front, should be in progress by the 16th. secondnameplaceholder argued that he was not ready to commit himself to a specific date. Given secondnameplaceholder's lack of qualifications as an army group commander, Guderian convinced himself that secondnameplaceholder tried to conceal his incompetence.[178] On 13 February Guderian met Hitler and demanded that General Walther Wenck be given a special mandate to command the offensive by Army Group Vistula. Hitler sent Wenck with a "special mandate", but without specifying Wenck's authority.[179] The offensive was launched on 16 February 1945, but soon stuck in rain and mud, facing mine fields and strong antitank defenses. That night Wenck was severely injured in a car accident, but it is doubtful that he could have salvaged the operation, as Guderian later claimed. secondnameplaceholder ordered the offensive to stop on the 18th by a "directive for regrouping".[180] Hitler officially ended Operation Solstice on 21 February and ordered secondnameplaceholder to transfer a corps headquarter and three divisions to Army Group Center.[181]secondnameplaceholder was unable to devise any viable plans for completion of his military objectives. Under pressure from Hitler over the worsening military situation, secondnameplaceholder became anxious and unable to give him coherent reports.[182] When the counter-attack failed to stop the Soviet advance, Hitler held secondnameplaceholder personally liable and accused him of not following orders. secondnameplaceholder's military command ended on 20 March, when Hitler replaced him with General Gotthard Heinrici as Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula. By this time secondnameplaceholder, who had been under the care of his doctor since 18 February, had fled to the Hohenlychen Sanatorium.[183] Hitler sent Guderian on a forced medical leave of absence, and he reassigned his post as chief of staff to Hans Krebs on 29 March.[184] secondnameplaceholder's failure and Hitler's response marked a serious deterioration in the relationship between the two men.[185]  By that time, the inner circle of people whom Hitler trusted was rapidly shrinking.[186]In early 1945, the German war effort was on the verge of collapse and secondnameplaceholder's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. secondnameplaceholder considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men,[187] and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.[188]secondnameplaceholder and Hitler met for the last time on 20 April 1945—Hitler's birthday—in Berlin, and secondnameplaceholder swore unswerving loyalty to Hitler. At a military briefing on that day, Hitler stated that he would not leave Berlin, in spite of Soviet advances. Along with Göring, secondnameplaceholder quickly left the city after the briefing.[189] On 21 April, secondnameplaceholder met with Norbert Masur, a Swedish representative of the World Jewish Congress, to discuss the release of Jewish concentration camp inmates.[190] As a result of these negotiations, about 20,000 people were released in the White Buses operation.[191] secondnameplaceholder falsely claimed in the meeting that the crematoria at camps had been built to deal with the bodies of prisoners who had died in a typhus epidemic. He also claimed very high survival rates for the camps at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, even as these sites were liberated and it became obvious that his figures were false.[192]On 23 April, secondnameplaceholder met directly with Bernadotte at the Swedish consulate in Lübeck. Representing himself as the provisional leader of Germany, he claimed that Hitler would be dead within the next few days. Hoping that the British and Americans would fight the Soviets alongside what remained of the Wehrmacht, secondnameplaceholder asked Bernadotte to inform General Dwight Eisenhower that Germany wished to surrender to the Western Allies, and not to the Soviet Union. Bernadotte asked secondnameplaceholder to put his proposal in writing, and secondnameplaceholder obliged.[193][194]Meanwhile, Göring had sent a telegram, a few hours earlier, asking Hitler for permission to assume leadership of the Reich in his capacity as Hitler's designated deputy—an act that Hitler, under the prodding of Martin Bormann, interpreted as a demand to step down or face a coup. On 27 April, secondnameplaceholder's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin, Hermann Fegelein, was caught in civilian clothes preparing to desert; he was arrested and brought back to the Führerbunker. On the evening of 28 April, the BBC broadcast a Reuters news report about secondnameplaceholder's attempted negotiations with the western Allies. Hitler had long considered secondnameplaceholder to be second only to Joseph Goebbels in loyalty; he called secondnameplaceholder "the loyal firstnameplaceholder" (German: der treue firstnameplaceholder). Hitler flew into a rage at this apparent betrayal, and told those still with him in the bunker complex that secondnameplaceholder's secret negotiations were the worst treachery he had ever known. Hitler ordered secondnameplaceholder's arrest, and Fegelein was court-martialed and shot.[195]By this time, the Soviets had advanced to the Potsdamer Platz, only 300 m (330 yd) from the Reich Chancellery, and were preparing to storm the Chancellery. This report, combined with secondnameplaceholder's treachery, prompted Hitler to write his last will and testament. In the testament, completed on 29 April—one day prior to his suicide—Hitler declared both secondnameplaceholder and Göring to be traitors. He stripped secondnameplaceholder of all of his party and state offices and expelled him from the Nazi Party.[196][197]Hitler named Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as his successor. secondnameplaceholder met Dönitz in Flensburg and offered himself as second-in-command. He maintained that he was entitled to a position in Dönitz's interim government as Reichsführer-SS, believing the SS would be in a good position to restore and maintain order after the war. Dönitz repeatedly rejected secondnameplaceholder's overtures[198] and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. He wrote a letter on 6 May—two days before the German Instrument of Surrender—formally dismissing secondnameplaceholder from all his posts.[199]
<h2>Capture and death</h2>
Rejected by his former comrades and hunted by the Allies, secondnameplaceholder attempted to go into hiding. He had not made extensive preparations for this, but he carried a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant firstnameplaceholder Hitzinger. With a small band of companions, he headed south on 11 May to Friedrichskoog, without a final destination in mind. They continued on to Neuhaus, where the group split up. On 21 May, secondnameplaceholder and two aides were stopped and detained at a checkpoint in Bremervörde set up by former Soviet POWs. Over the following two days, he was moved around to several camps[200] and was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near Lüneburg, on 23 May.[201] The officials noticed that secondnameplaceholder's identity papers bore a stamp which British military intelligence had seen being used by fleeing members of the SS.[202]The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began a routine interrogation. secondnameplaceholder admitted who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. secondnameplaceholder was taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where a doctor conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of secondnameplaceholder's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. secondnameplaceholder then bit into a hidden potassium cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes.[203][204] Shortly afterward, secondnameplaceholder's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.[205]
<h2>Mysticism and symbolism</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was interested in mysticism and the occult from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly among members of the SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation. Viewing the SS as an "order" along the lines of the Teutonic Knights, he had them take over the Church of the Teutonic Order in Vienna in 1939. He began the process of replacing Christianity with a new moral code that rejected humanitarianism and challenged the Christian concept of marriage.[206] The Ahnenerbe, a research society founded by secondnameplaceholder in 1935, searched the globe for proof of the superiority and ancient origins of the Germanic race.[207][208]All regalia and uniforms of Nazi Germany, particularly those of the SS, used symbolism in their designs. The stylised lightning bolt logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of runes from a set of 18 Armanen runes created by Guido von List in 1906. The ancient Sowilō rune originally symbolised the sun, but was renamed "Sig" (victory) in List's iconography.[209] secondnameplaceholder modified a variety of existing customs to emphasise the elitism and central role of the SS; an SS naming ceremony was to replace baptism, marriage ceremonies were to be altered, a separate SS funeral ceremony was to be held in addition to Christian ceremonies, and SS-centric celebrations of the summer and winter solstices were instituted.[210][211] The Totenkopf (death's head) symbol, used by German military units for hundreds of years, had been chosen for the SS by Schreck.[212] secondnameplaceholder placed particular importance on the death's-head rings; they were never to be sold, and were to be returned to him upon the death of the owner. He interpreted the deaths-head symbol to mean solidarity to the cause and a commitment unto death.[213]
<h2>Relationship with Hitler</h2>
As second in command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, secondnameplaceholder was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards;[214] secondnameplaceholder was not involved with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power.[215] From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.[216]Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.[217][218] Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders.[219] Bormann used his position as Hitler's secretary to control the flow of information and access to Hitler.[220]Hitler promoted and practised the Führerprinzip. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex.[221] Accordingly, secondnameplaceholder placed himself in a position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him.[222] However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich.[223] secondnameplaceholder considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler.[224] Speer refused to accept secondnameplaceholder's offer of the high rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer, as he felt to do so would put him in secondnameplaceholder's debt and obligate him to allow secondnameplaceholder a say in armaments production.[225]Hitler called secondnameplaceholder's mystical and pseudoreligious interests "nonsense".[226] secondnameplaceholder was not a member of Hitler's inner circle; the two men were not very close, and rarely saw each other socially.[227][217] secondnameplaceholder socialised almost exclusively with other members of the SS.[228] His unconditional loyalty and efforts to please Hitler earned him the nickname of der treue firstnameplaceholder ("the faithful firstnameplaceholder"). In the last days of the war, when it became clear that Hitler planned to die in Berlin, secondnameplaceholder left his long-time superior to try to save himself.[229]
<h2>Marriage and family</h2>
secondnameplaceholder met his future wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, she was a nurse who shared his interest in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929.[230] The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war.[231] Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. secondnameplaceholder was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, Töhle.[232]After the Nazis came to power the family moved first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where they bought a house. secondnameplaceholder also later obtained a large house in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem, free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as secondnameplaceholder became totally absorbed by work.[233] The relationship was strained.[234][235] The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.[236]Hedwig Potthast, secondnameplaceholder's young secretary starting in 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left her job in 1941. He arranged accommodation for her, first in Mecklenburg and later at Berchtesgaden. He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in Gmund with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and secondnameplaceholder were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship for the sake of her daughter. Working as a nurse for the German Red Cross during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in Military District III (Berlin-Brandenburg). secondnameplaceholder was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed Püppi ("dolly"); he phoned her every few days and visited as often as he could.[237]Margarete's diaries reveal that Gerhard had to leave the National Political Educational Institute in Berlin because of poor results. At the age of 16 he joined the SS in Brno and shortly afterwards went "into battle." He was captured by the Russians but later returned to Germany.[238]Hedwig and Margarete both remained loyal to secondnameplaceholder. Writing to Gebhard in February 1945, Margarete said, "How wonderful that he has been called to great tasks and is equal to them. The whole of Germany is looking to him."[239] Hedwig expressed similar sentiments in a letter to secondnameplaceholder in January. Margarete and Gudrun left Gmund as Allied troops advanced into the area. They were arrested by American troops in Bolzano, Italy, and held in various internment camps in Italy, France, and Germany. They were brought to Nuremberg to testify at the trials and were released in November 1946. Gudrun emerged from the experience embittered by her alleged mistreatment and remained devoted to her father's memory.[240][241] She later worked for the West German spy agency Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) from 1961 to 1963.[242]
<h2>Historical assessment</h2>
Peter Longerich observes that secondnameplaceholder's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system under the auspices of the SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.[243] Historian Wolfgang Sauer says that "although he was pedantic, dogmatic, and dull, secondnameplaceholder emerged under Hitler as second in actual power. His strength lay in a combination of unusual shrewdness, burning ambition, and servile loyalty to Hitler."[244] In 2008, the German news magazine Der Spiegel described secondnameplaceholder as one of the most brutal mass murderers in history and the architect of the Holocaust.[245]Historian John Toland relates a story by Günter Syrup, a subordinate of Heydrich. Heydrich showed him a picture of secondnameplaceholder and said: "The top half is the teacher, but the lower half is the sadist."[246] Historian Adrian Weale comments that secondnameplaceholder and the SS followed Hitler's policies without question or ethical considerations. secondnameplaceholder accepted Hitler and Nazi ideology and saw the SS as a chivalric Teutonic order of new Germans. secondnameplaceholder adopted the doctrine of Auftragstaktik ("mission command"), whereby orders were given as broad directives, with authority delegated downward to the appropriate level to carry them out in a timely and efficient manner. Weale states that the SS ideology gave the men a doctrinal framework, and the mission command tactics allowed the junior officers leeway to act on their own initiative to obtain the desired results.[247]Printed

Sir firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (Welsh: Harri secondnameplaceholder) 24 January  1635 – 25 August 1688) was a Welsh privateer, plantation owner, and, later, Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica. From his base in Port Royal, Jamaica, he raided settlements and shipping on the Spanish Main, becoming wealthy as he did so. With the prize money from the raids he purchased three large sugar plantations on the island.Much of secondnameplaceholder's early life is unknown. He was born in Monmouthshire,[n 1] but it is not known how he made his way to the West Indies, or how he began his career as a privateer. He was probably a member of a group of raiders led by Sir Christopher Myngs in the early 1660s during the Anglo-Spanish War. secondnameplaceholder became a close friend of Sir Thomas Modyford, the Governor of Jamaica. When diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of England and Spain worsened in 1667, Modyford gave secondnameplaceholder a letter of marque, a licence to attack and seize Spanish vessels. secondnameplaceholder subsequently conducted successful and highly lucrative raids on Puerto Principe (now Camagüey in modern Cuba) and Porto Bello (now Portobelo in modern Panama). In 1668 he sailed for Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela. He raided both cities and stripped them of their wealth before destroying a large Spanish squadron as he escaped.In 1671 secondnameplaceholder attacked Panama City, landing on the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was on the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids. To appease the Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, secondnameplaceholder was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but was treated as a hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II.secondnameplaceholder was appointed a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 and returned to the Colony of Jamaica shortly afterward to serve as the territory's Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly of Jamaica until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as Governor of Jamaica in the absence of the post-holder. A memoir published by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former shipmate of secondnameplaceholder's, accused the privateer of widespread torture and other offences; secondnameplaceholder brought a libel suit against the book's English publishers and won, although the black picture Exquemelin portrayed of secondnameplaceholder has affected history's view of the Welshman. He died in Jamaica on 25 August 1688. His life was romanticised after his death and he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born around 1635 in Wales, either in Llanrumney or Pencarn, (both in Monmouthshire, between Cardiff and Newport)[2][n 1][n 2] The historian David Williams, writing in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography, observes that attempts to identify his parents and antecedents "have all proved unsatisfactory",[4] although his will referred to distant relations.[3] Several sources state secondnameplaceholder's father was Robert secondnameplaceholder, a farmer.[2][n 3] Nuala Zahedieh, writing for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, states that details of secondnameplaceholder's early life and career are uncertain, although in later life he stated that he had left school early and was "much more used to the pike than the book".[2]It is unknown how secondnameplaceholder made his way to the Caribbean. He may have travelled to the Caribbean as part of the army of Robert Venables, sent by Oliver Cromwell as part of the Caribbean expedition against the Spanish in the West Indies in 1654,[5] or he may have served as an apprentice to a maker of cutlery for three years in exchange for the cost of his emigration.[4] Richard Browne, who served as surgeon under secondnameplaceholder in 1670 stated that secondnameplaceholder had travelled either as a "private gentleman" soon after the 1655 capture of Jamaica by the English,[2] or he may have been abducted in Bristol and transported to Barbados, where he was sold as a servant.[6] In the 17th century the Caribbean offered an opportunity for young men to become rich quickly, although significant investment was needed to obtain high returns from the sugar export economy. Other opportunities for financial gain were through trade or plunder of the Spanish Empire.[2] Much of the plunder was from privateering, whereby individuals and ships were commissioned by government to attack the country's enemies.[7][n 4]
<h2>Career as a privateer</h2>
It is probable that in the early 1660s secondnameplaceholder was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and settlements in the Caribbean and Central America when England was at war with Spain. In 1663 it is likely that secondnameplaceholder captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula.[5][10][11][n 5]Sir Thomas Modyford had been appointed the Governor of Jamaica in February 1664 with instructions to limit the activities of the privateers; he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 June 1664, but economic practicalities led to him reversing the policy by the end of the month.[13] About 1,500 privateers used Jamaica as a base for their activity and brought significant revenue to the island. As the planting community of 5,000 was still new and developing, the revenue from the privateers was needed to avoid economic collapse.[13] A privateer was granted a letter of marque which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels, normally of a specific country, or with conditions attached. A portion of all spoils obtained by the privateers was given to the sovereign or the issuing ambassador.[7]In August 1665 secondnameplaceholder, along with fellow captains John Morris and Jacob Fackman, returned to Port Royal with a large cargo of valuables. Modyford was impressed enough with the spoils to report back to the government that "Central America was the properest  [sic] place for an attack on the Spanish Indies".[2][14] secondnameplaceholder's activities over the following two years are not documented, but in early 1666 he was married in Port Royal to his cousin, Mary secondnameplaceholder, the daughter of Edward, the island's Deputy Governor; the marriage gave firstnameplaceholder access to the upper levels of Jamaican society. The couple had no children.[15]Hostilities between the English and Dutch in 1664 led to a change in government policy: colonial governors were now authorised to issue letters of marque against the Dutch.[n 6] Many of the privateers, including secondnameplaceholder, did not take up the letters, although an expedition to conquer the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius led to the death of secondnameplaceholder's father-in-law, who was leading a 600-man force.[17]Sources differ about secondnameplaceholder's activities in 1666.[18] H. R. Allen, in his biography of secondnameplaceholder, considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued a letter of marque for the invasion of Curaçao, although he did not attack Willemstad, the main city, either after he decided that it was too well-defended or that there was insufficient plunder.[19][20][n 7] Alternatively, Jan Rogoziński and Stephan Talty, in their histories of secondnameplaceholder and piracy, record that during the year, secondnameplaceholder oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership.[21][22][n 8] It was around this time that secondnameplaceholder purchased his first plantation on Jamaica.[23]In 1667 diplomatic relations between the kingdoms of England and Spain were worsening, and rumours began to circulate in Jamaica about a possible Spanish invasion. Modyford authorised privateers to take action against the Spanish, and issued a letter of marque to secondnameplaceholder "to draw together the English privateers and take prisoners of the Spanish nation, whereby he might inform of the intention of that enemy to attack Jamaica, of which I have frequent and strong advice".[24] He was given the rank of admiral and, in January 1668, assembled 10 ships and 500 men for the task; he was subsequently joined by 2 more ships and 200 men from Tortuga (now part of Haiti).[22][25]secondnameplaceholder's letter of marque gave him permission to attack Spanish ships at sea; there was no permission for attacks on land. Any plunder obtained from the attacks would be split between the government and the owners of the ships rented by the privateers. If the privateers stepped outside their official remit and raided a city, any resultant plunder would be retained by the privateers. Rogoziński observes that "attacks on cities were illegal piracy—but extremely profitable",[22] although Zahedieh records that if secondnameplaceholder was able to provide evidence of a potential Spanish attack, the attacks on cities were justifiable under the terms of his commission.[2] secondnameplaceholder's initial plan was to attack Havana, but, on discovering it was heavily defended, this was changed to Puerto Principe (now Camagüey), a town 50 miles (80 km) inland. secondnameplaceholder and his men took the town, but the treasure obtained was less than hoped for.[26][27] According to Alexandre Exquemelin, who sailed with secondnameplaceholder, "It caused a general resentment and grief, to see such a small booty".[28] When secondnameplaceholder reported the taking of Puerto Principe to Modyford, he informed the governor that they had evidence that the Spanish were planning an attack on British territory: "we found seventy men had been pressed to go against Jamaica ... and considerable forces were expected from Vera Cruz and Campeachy ... and from Porto Bello and Cartagena to rendezvous at St Jago of Cuba [Santiago]".[29]After the action, one of the English privateers quarrelled with one of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, secondnameplaceholder arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. secondnameplaceholder kept his word and the sailor was hanged.[30] After dividing the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, secondnameplaceholder announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because of the value of the goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town.[31] The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left secondnameplaceholder's service and returned to Tortuga.[32] secondnameplaceholder and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.[31]On 11 July 1668 secondnameplaceholder anchored short of Porto Bello and transferred his men to 23 canoes, which they paddled to within three miles (4.8 km) of the target. They landed and approached the first castle from the landward side, where they arrived half an hour before dawn. They took the three castles and the town quickly.[33][34] The privateers lost 18 men, with a further 32 wounded; Zahedieh considers the action at Porto Bello displayed a "clever cunning and expert timing which marked ... [secondnameplaceholder's] brilliance as a military commander".[2]Exquemelin wrote that in order to take the third castle, secondnameplaceholder ordered the construction of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast; when they were completed he "commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle ... these were forced, at the head of the companies to raise and apply them to the walls ... Thus many of the religious men and nuns were killed".[35] Terry Breverton, in his biography of secondnameplaceholder, writes that when a translation of Exquemelin's book was published in England, secondnameplaceholder sued for libel and won. The passage about the use of nuns and monks as a human shield was retracted from subsequent publications in England.[36]secondnameplaceholder and his men remained in Porto Bello for a month. He wrote to Don Agustín, the acting president of Panama, to demand a ransom for the city of 350,000 pesos.[n 9] As they stripped the city of its wealth it is probable that torture was used on the residents to uncover hidden caches of money and jewels. Zahedieh records that there were no first-hand reports from witnesses that confirmed Exquemelin's claim of widespread rape and debauchery.[2] After an attempt by Don Agustín to recapture the city by force – his army of 800 soldiers was repelled by the privateers – he negotiated a ransom of 100,000 pesos.[38] Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, secondnameplaceholder returned to Port Royal, with between £70,000 and £100,000 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbados's sugar exports. Each privateer received £120 – equivalent to five or six times the average annual earnings of a sailor of the time.[2] secondnameplaceholder received a five per cent share for his work;[39] Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of secondnameplaceholder's letter of marque.[40][41] As secondnameplaceholder had overstepped the limits of his commission, Modyford reported back to London that he had "reproved" him for his actions although, Zahedieh observes, in Britain "secondnameplaceholder was widely viewed as a national hero and neither he nor Modyford were rebuked for their actions".[2]secondnameplaceholder did not stay long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, a small island he used as a rendezvous point.[42] His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main.[43] In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which had been sent to Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to secondnameplaceholder, who made it his flagship.[44] On 2 January 1669 secondnameplaceholder called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew.[n 10] secondnameplaceholder and the captains seated on one side of the table were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other side of the table were all killed.[48][49]The loss of Oxford meant secondnameplaceholder's flotilla was too small to attempt an attack on Cartagena. Instead he was persuaded by a French captain under his command to repeat the actions of the pirate François l'Olonnais two years previously: an attack on Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela.[50] The French captain knew the approaches to the lagoon, through a narrow and shallow channel. Since l'Olonnais and the French captain had visited Maracaibo, the Spanish had built the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, 20 miles (32 km) outside the city, on the approach. Talty states that the fortress was placed in an excellent position to defend the town, but that the Spanish had undermanned it, leaving only nine men to load and fire the fortress's 11 guns.[51] Under covering cannon fire from the privateer's flagship, Lilly, secondnameplaceholder and his men landed on the beach and stormed the fortification; they found it empty when they eventually breached its defences. A search soon found that the Spanish had left a slow-burning fuse leading to the fort's powder kegs as a trap for the buccaneers, which secondnameplaceholder extinguished.[52] The fort's guns were spiked and then buried so they could not be used against the privateers when they returned from the rest of their mission.[53]secondnameplaceholder arrived at Maracaibo to find the city largely deserted, its residents having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops.[54] He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, and some of the remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden.[55] Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure secondnameplaceholder kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.[56]Four days after he left Maracaibo, secondnameplaceholder returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, was waiting for him at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack secondnameplaceholder, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress.[2][57] The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and negotiations between secondnameplaceholder and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for secondnameplaceholder to leave all their spoils and slaves and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow secondnameplaceholder and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. secondnameplaceholder put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work.[58]To this end, a crew of 12 prepared a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder were placed in the ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.[59]On 1 May 1669 secondnameplaceholder and his flotilla attacked the Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and Magdalen was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship and made his way to the fort, where he continued to direct events.[60] The second-largest Spanish ship, Soledad, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with the rigging meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed the rigging and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers.[61] secondnameplaceholder still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to negotiate, and threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with secondnameplaceholder, and agreed to pay him 20,000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, secondnameplaceholder had undertaken salvage operations on Magdalen, and secured 15,000 pesos from the wreck.[62] Before taking any action, secondnameplaceholder tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, to ensure that it was not all lost if one ship was sunk; it totalled 250,000 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves.[63]secondnameplaceholder observed that Espinosa had set his cannon for a landward attack from the privateers – as they had done previously. The privateers faked a landing of their forces. The fort and its battlements were stripped of men as the Spanish prepared for a night assault from the English forces. That evening, with Spanish forces deployed to repel a landing, secondnameplaceholder's fleet raised anchor without unfurling their sails; the fleet moved on the tide, only raising sail when they had moved level with the fortress, and secondnameplaceholder and his men made their way back to Port Royal unscathed.[64][n 11] Zahedieh considers the escape showed secondnameplaceholder's "characteristic cunning and audacity".[2]During his absence from Port Royal, a pro-Spanish faction had gained the ear of King Charles II, and English foreign policy had changed accordingly. Modyford admonished secondnameplaceholder for his action, which had gone beyond his commission, and revoked the letters of marque; no official action was taken against any of the privateers.[66][67] secondnameplaceholder invested a share of his prize money in an 836-acre (338 ha) plantation – his second such investment.[68]In 1669 Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain, ordered attacks on English shipping in the Caribbean. The first action took place in March 1670 when Spanish privateers attacked English trade ships.[69] In response Modyford commissioned secondnameplaceholder "to do and perform all manner of exploits, which may tend to the preservation and quiet of this island".[70] By December secondnameplaceholder was sailing toward the Spanish Main with a fleet of over 30 English and French ships carrying a large number of privateers.[42][n 12] Zahedieh observes that the army of privateers was the largest that had gathered in the Caribbean at the time, which was "a mark of secondnameplaceholder's renown".[2]secondnameplaceholder's first action was to take the connected islands of Old Providence and Santa Catalina in December 1670.[74] From there his fleet sailed to Chagres, the port from which ships were loaded with goods to transport back to Spain. secondnameplaceholder took the town and occupied Fort San Lorenzo, which he garrisoned to protect his line of retreat. On 9 January 1671, with his remaining men, he ascended the Chagres River and headed for  Old Panama City, on the Pacific Coast.[75] Much of the journey was on foot, through dense rainforests and swamps.[76] The governor of Panama had been forewarned of a potential attack, and had sent Spanish troops to attack secondnameplaceholder and his men along the route. The privateers transferred to canoes to complete part of the journey, but were still able to beat off the ambushes with ease.[77] After three days, with the river difficult to navigate in places, and with the jungle thinning out, secondnameplaceholder landed his men and travelled overland across the remaining part of the isthmus.[78]The privateers, including Captain Robert Searle, arrived at Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped overnight before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced.[79][80] secondnameplaceholder sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine that led to the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from secondnameplaceholder's main force of troops. When the party came into view at the end of the ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force.[81][82] In an effort to disorganise secondnameplaceholder's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops.[83] The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.[2][84]Panama's governor had sworn to burn down the city if his troops lost to the privateers, and he had placed barrels of gunpowder around the largely wooden buildings. These were detonated by the captain of artillery after secondnameplaceholder's victory; the resultant fires lasted until the following day.[n 13] Only a few stone buildings remained standing afterwards.[84] Much of Panama's wealth was destroyed in the conflagration, although some had been removed by ships, before the privateers arrived.[86] The privateers spent three weeks in Panama and plundered what they could from the ruins. secondnameplaceholder's second-in-command, Captain Edward Collier, supervised the torture of some of the city's residents; secondnameplaceholder's fleet surgeon, Richard Browne, later wrote that at Panama, secondnameplaceholder "was noble enough to the vanquished enemy".[87][88]The value of treasure secondnameplaceholder collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty writes that the figures range from 140,000 to 400,000 pesos, and that owing to the large army secondnameplaceholder assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent.[89] There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelin's memoirs, that secondnameplaceholder left away with the majority of the plunder.[84][90] He arrived back in Port Royal on 12 March to a positive welcome from the town's inhabitants. The following month he made his official report to the governing Council of Jamaica, and received their formal thanks and congratulations.[91]
<h2>Arrest and release; knighthood and governorship (1672–1675)</h2>
During secondnameplaceholder's absence from Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid.[n 14] The pact aimed to establish peace in the Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it probable that one of the Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement.[94]The destruction of Panama so soon after the signing of the treaty led to what Allen describes as "a crisis in international affairs" between England and Spain.[95] The English government heard rumours from their ambassadors in Europe that the Spanish were considering war. In an attempt to appease them, Charles II and his Secretary of State, the Earl of Arlington, ordered secondnameplaceholder's arrest. In April 1672 the privateer admiral was returned to London where, Barbour writes, he was "handsomely lionized ... as the hero on whom Drake's mantle had fallen".[96][97] Although some sources state that secondnameplaceholder was also incarcerated in the Tower of London,[n 15] Pope writes that Tower records make no mention of his presence there.[98]secondnameplaceholder probably remained at liberty throughout his time in London, and the political mood changed in his favour. Arlington asked him to write a memorandum for the King on how to improve Jamaica's defences.[99] Although there was no court case – secondnameplaceholder was never charged with an offence – he gave informal evidence to the Lords of Trade and Plantations and proved he had no knowledge of the Treaty of Madrid prior to his attack on Panama.[100] Unhappy with Lynch's conduct in Jamaica, the King and his advisers decided in January 1674 to replace him with John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Carbery.  secondnameplaceholder would act as his deputy.[101] Charles appointed secondnameplaceholder a Knight Bachelor in November 1674, and two months later, secondnameplaceholder and Carbery left for Jamaica.  They were accompanied by Modyford, released from the Tower of London without charge and made the Chief Justice of Jamaica.[13][102] They travelled on board the Jamaica Merchant, which held cannon and shot meant to boost Port Royal's defences. The ship foundered on the rocks of Île-à-Vache and secondnameplaceholder and the crew were temporarily stranded on the island until picked up by a passing merchant ship.[103]
<h2>In Jamaican politics (1675–1688)</h2>
On his arrival in Jamaica, the 12-man Assembly of Jamaica voted secondnameplaceholder an annual salary of £600 "for his good services to the country"; the move angered Carbery, who did not get on with secondnameplaceholder.[104] Carbery later complained of his deputy that he was "every day more convinced of ... [secondnameplaceholder's] imprudence and unfitness to have anything to do with civil government".[105][106] Carbery also wrote to the Secretary of State to bemoan secondnameplaceholder's "drinking and gaming at the taverns" of Port Royal.[106]Although secondnameplaceholder had been ordered to eradicate piracy from Jamaican waters,[107] he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if secondnameplaceholder received the dues owed to him.[2] As secondnameplaceholder was no longer able to issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Byndloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Byndloss and secondnameplaceholder received a commission for each one signed.[108][109]In July 1676 Carbery called for a hearing against secondnameplaceholder in front of the Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. secondnameplaceholder admitted he had met the French officials, but indicated that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a decision on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving secondnameplaceholder as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.[110][111]By the late 1670s France became an increasing threat in the Caribbean, and secondnameplaceholder took control of the defence of Port Royal. He declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 – both during his periods as temporary governor of the island – because of the threat of invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, and increased the number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680.[2][112]As secondnameplaceholder and his allies on the Assembly of Jamaica continued to deal with privateers and pirates, criticism of their action in London was fomented by two former governors of Jamaica, Carbery and Lynch.[113][114] After Lynch paid £50,000 to Charles II, secondnameplaceholder's commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and Lynch was appointed as the island's governor; secondnameplaceholder still retained his position on the Assembly of Jamaica.[113][115] secondnameplaceholder had been a heavy drinker for several years;[n 16] he received the news of the revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of alcohol to the point where his health began to suffer.[115][117] Lynch removed secondnameplaceholder's supporters from the Assembly of Jamaica by 1683, and in October that year he removed secondnameplaceholder and his brother-in-law, leaving the assembly packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 Lynch died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth.[118]In 1684 an account of secondnameplaceholder's exploits was published by Exquemelin, in a Dutch volume entitled De Americaensche Zee-Roovers (trans: About the Buccaneers of America). secondnameplaceholder took steps to discredit the book and successfully brought a libel suit against the book's publishers William Crooke and Thomas Malthus. In his affidavit he stated that he had "against evil deeds, piracies and robberies the greatest abhorrence and distrust", and that "for the kind of men called buccaneers", he "always had and still has hatred". The court found in his favour and the book was retracted; damages of £200 were paid to him.[119]In December 1687 Lynch's permanent replacement arrived in Port George, secondnameplaceholder's friend from his time in London, Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle. He dismissed Molesworth and gave secondnameplaceholder an unofficial role as advisor.[120] In July 1688 Albemarle persuaded the king to allow secondnameplaceholder to regain a position on the Assembly, but the former privateer was too ill to attend.[121] Hans Sloane, Albemarle's private physician, inspected secondnameplaceholder and diagnosed dropsy; he also saw secondnameplaceholder was drinking to excess and ordered him to reduce his alcohol intake, a directive which secondnameplaceholder ignored. Sloane described his patient as
<h2>Morgan the slave owner</h2>
In the 1670s and 1680s, in his capacity as an owner of three large slave plantations, secondnameplaceholder led three campaigns against the Jamaican Maroons of Juan de Serras. secondnameplaceholder achieved some success against the Maroons, who withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, where they were able to stay out of the reach of secondnameplaceholder and his forces. However, secondnameplaceholder failed in his attempts to either capture de Serras or to subdue his community of runaway slaves.[123]By the time secondnameplaceholder died, he owned three plantations and large numbers of African slaves. He left most of his estate to his wife for the rest of her life. On her death, most of his land and slaves passed to his nephew Charles, second son of Robert Byndloss, who served as Chief Justice of Jamaica in 1681. secondnameplaceholder also left a parcel of land in the now-defunct parish of St George to another Robert Byndloss (born c. 1673) the eldest son of his brother-in-law Robert Byndloss.[124]secondnameplaceholder also left some land in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica to his friend, Roger Elletson, who was the ancestor of a future governor of Jamaica with the same name.[125]secondnameplaceholder's will was probated in 1689, and at his death he owned 131 African slaves on his estates, of which 64 were male and 67 female. About 33 of these slaves were listed as boys, girls or children. The slaves were valued at £1,923.[126]
<h2>Death and subsequent events</h2>
secondnameplaceholder died on 25 August 1688; Albemarle ordered a state funeral, and laid secondnameplaceholder's body at King's House for the public to pay respects. An amnesty was declared so that pirates and privateers could pay their respects without fear of arrest. He was buried at Palisadoes cemetery, Port Royal, followed by a 22-gun salute from the ships moored in the harbour.[127][128] secondnameplaceholder was a wealthy man when he died. His personal wealth was valued at £5,263.[2]His will initially left his plantations and slaves to his wife, Mary Elizabeth, but because they were childless, on her death his estate was to pass to his nephews, the children of his brother-in-law Byndloss. The burial of Lady secondnameplaceholder was recorded in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica on 3 March 1696.[129][130]In his will, signed 17 June 1688, he left his Jamaican property to his godsons Charles Byndloss and firstnameplaceholder Archbold, on condition they adopted the surname of secondnameplaceholder. These were the children of his two cousins Anna Petronilla Byndloss and Johanna Archbold. To his sister Catherine Loyd he awarded £60 per annum from his estate "paid into the hands of my ever honest cozen  [sic] Thomas secondnameplaceholder of Tredegar".[131]On 7 June 1692 an earthquake struck Port Royal. About two-thirds of the town, amounting to 33 acres (13 ha), sank into Kingston harbour immediately after the main shock. Palisadoes cemetery, including secondnameplaceholder's grave, was one of the parts of the city to fall into the sea; his body has never been subsequently located.[132][133]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
Rogoziński observes that secondnameplaceholder is probably the "best-known pirate" because of Exquemelin's book,[22] although, Cordingly writes that Exquemelin bore a grudge over what he saw was secondnameplaceholder's theft of the bounty from Panama. His experience explains "why he painted such a black picture of secondnameplaceholder and portrayed him as a cruel and unscrupulous villain",[134] which subsequently affected historians' view of secondnameplaceholder.[22][135] Allen observes that, partly because of Exquemelin, secondnameplaceholder has not been well-served by historians. He cites the examples of the historians whose biographies were so flawed they wrote that secondnameplaceholder either died in London, prison or the Tower of London. These included Charles Leslie, A New History of Jamaica (1739), Alan Gardner, History of Jamaica (1873), Hubert Bancroft, History of Central America (1883) and Howard Pyle's work, Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates (compiled in 1921).[136]Exquemelin wrote that secondnameplaceholder's men undertook widespread torture in several of the towns they captured. According to Stephen Snelders, in his history of piracy, the Spanish reports of secondnameplaceholder's raids do not refer to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar – although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in Panama.[137] The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time.[138][n 17] secondnameplaceholder always fought with a commission from the governor of Jamaica. In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence of Jamaica.[22][140] As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried letters of marque, they considered secondnameplaceholder to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected.[141][142]Rogoziński observes that secondnameplaceholder does not appear in later fictional works as much as other pirates because of his "ambiguous mixture of charismatic leadership and selfish treachery",[68] although his name and persona have featured in literature, including Rafael Sabatini's 1922 novel Captain Blood and John Steinbeck's first novel, Cup of Gold (1929), both of which are based in large part on secondnameplaceholder's career.[143][144] secondnameplaceholder and stories of a hidden haul of treasure also feature to a lesser extent in other works, including Ian Fleming's 1954 novel Live and Let Die[145] and John Masefield's 1920 poem "Captain Stratton's Fancy".[146][n 18] Screen renditions of his life include Captain Blood (1935), The Black Swan (1942),[n 19] Blackbeard the Pirate (1952), secondnameplaceholder, the Pirate (1961), Pirates of Tortuga (1961) and The Black Corsair (1976).[68] secondnameplaceholder has also been featured in several video games, including Sid Meier's Pirates! and Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships.[149]In 1944 the Seagram Company started manufacturing the Captain secondnameplaceholder brand of rum, named after the privateer and up until the 1990s the bottle neck had an illustration of a crest with the Welsh word 'UNDEB' for 'union' or 'unity' underneath, reflecting firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's origin. This was later dropped in 2001 with the sale of the Captain secondnameplaceholder brand to Diageo, the multinational drinks company based in London.[150][151] The name of secondnameplaceholder has been attached to local sites in the Caribbean, such as secondnameplaceholder's Bridge, secondnameplaceholder's Pass and secondnameplaceholder's Valley in Clarendon,[152] secondnameplaceholder's Harbour Hotel and Beach Club in Kingston,[153] the Hotel firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, located in Roatán, Honduras,[154] the Port secondnameplaceholder resort located in Haiti[155] and Captain secondnameplaceholder's Retreat and Vacation Club on Ambergris Caye, Belize.[156]The economist Peter Leeson believes that pirates and privateers were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as murderous tyrants.[157] The anthropologist Anne M. Galvin and the historian Kris Lane separately see secondnameplaceholder as obtaining wealth to become a member of the landed gentry;[158][159] Galvin wrote that secondnameplaceholder showed "social mobility through self-interested acts of outlawry, political wiles, and business acumen".[159] Glenn Blalock, writing for the American National Biography, claims that secondnameplaceholder was seen as a hero to many Jamaicans and British both for his exploits as a buccaneer and for ensuring Jamaica remained a key part of the British Empire.[5] However, many Jamaicans see secondnameplaceholder as a "criminal pirate" who sought to maintain the system of slavery.[160][161]Thomas describes secondnameplaceholder as

firstnameplaceholder Wilhelm secondnameplaceholder (or Goering;[a] German: [ˈɡøːʁɪŋ] (listen); 12 January 1893 – 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader, and convicted war criminal. He was one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945.A veteran World War I fighter pilot ace, he was a recipient of the Pour le Mérite ("The Blue Max"). He was the last commander of Jagdgeschwader 1 (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by Manfred von Richthofen. An early member of the Nazi Party, secondnameplaceholder was among those wounded in Adolf Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to morphine which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, secondnameplaceholder was named as minister without portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the Gestapo, which he ceded to Heinrich Himmler in 1934.Following the establishment of the Nazi state, secondnameplaceholder amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan in 1936, secondnameplaceholder was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the Fall of France in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of Reichsmarschall, which gave him seniority over all officers in Germany's armed forces.By 1941, secondnameplaceholder was at the peak of his power and influence. As the Second World War progressed, secondnameplaceholder's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities and resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, secondnameplaceholder increasingly withdrew from military and political affairs to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, secondnameplaceholder sent a telegram to Hitler requesting his permission to assume leadership of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed secondnameplaceholder from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest. After the war, secondnameplaceholder was convicted of conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials in 1946. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide hours before the sentence was to be carried out.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born on 12 January 1893[4] at the Marienbad Sanatorium in Rosenheim, Bavaria. His father, Heinrich Ernst secondnameplaceholder (31 October 1839 – 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of German South West Africa (modern-day Namibia).[5] Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. secondnameplaceholder was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. secondnameplaceholder's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was Albert. At the time that secondnameplaceholder was born, his father was serving as consul general in Haiti, and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.[6]secondnameplaceholder's godfather was firstnameplaceholder Epenstein [de], a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the secondnameplaceholder family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,[7] then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near Nuremberg. secondnameplaceholder's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of Ritter (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.[8]Interested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, secondnameplaceholder enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a Boer uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.[9] He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying Teutonic legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the Mont Blanc massif, and in the Austrian Alps. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at Berlin Lichterfelde, from which he graduated with distinction.[10] (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1946, psychologist Gustave Gilbert measured him as having an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 138.)[11]secondnameplaceholder joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry, Garrison: Mülhausen) of the Prussian Army in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to Munich; secondnameplaceholder's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, secondnameplaceholder was stationed at Mülhausen with his regiment.[10]
<h2>World War I</h2>
During the first year of World War I, secondnameplaceholder served with his infantry regiment in the area of Mülhausen, a garrison town less than 2 km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with rheumatism, a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend Bruno Loerzer convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the Luftstreitkräfte ("air combat forces") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, secondnameplaceholder flew as Loerzer's observer in Feldflieger Abteilung 25 (FFA 25) – secondnameplaceholder had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, secondnameplaceholder's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the Crown Prince's Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both secondnameplaceholder and Loerzer with the Iron Cross, first class.[12]After completing the pilot's training course, secondnameplaceholder was assigned to Jagdstaffel 5. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to Jagdstaffel 26, commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored air victories until May, when he was assigned to command Jagdstaffel 27. Serving with Jastas 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the Zähringer Lion with swords, the Friedrich Order, the House Order of Hohenzollern with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted Pour le Mérite.[13] According to firstnameplaceholder Dahlmann, who knew both men, secondnameplaceholder had Loerzer lobby for the award.[14] He finished the war with 22 victories.[15] A thorough post-war examination of Allied loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.[16]On 7 July 1918, following the death of Wilhelm Reinhard, successor to Manfred von Richthofen, secondnameplaceholder was made commander of the "Flying Circus", Jagdgeschwader 1.[17] His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.[18]In the last days of the war, secondnameplaceholder was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.[19]Like many other German veterans, secondnameplaceholder was a proponent of the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.[20]
<h2>After World War I</h2>
secondnameplaceholder remained in aviation after the war. He tried barnstorming and briefly worked at Fokker. After spending most of 1919 living in Denmark, he moved to Sweden and joined Svensk Lufttrafik, a Swedish airline. secondnameplaceholder was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, he was hired by Count Eric von Rosen to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, secondnameplaceholder may at this time have first seen the swastika emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.[21][b]This was also the first time that secondnameplaceholder saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness Carin von Kantzow (née Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. secondnameplaceholder was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when secondnameplaceholder left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed secondnameplaceholder to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.[22] Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the Bavarian Alps, near Bayrischzell, some 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Munich.[23] After secondnameplaceholder met Adolf Hitler and joined the Nazi Party in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.[24]
<h2>Early Nazi career</h2>
secondnameplaceholder joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.[24][25] He was given command of the Sturmabteilung (SA) as the Oberster SA-Führer in 1923.[26] He was later appointed an SA-Gruppenführer (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin—who liked Hitler—often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, and Ernst Röhm.[27] Hitler later recalled his early association with secondnameplaceholder:Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power.[29] Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. secondnameplaceholder, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the groin.[30] Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.[31] With Carin's help, secondnameplaceholder was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December.[32] This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg.[33] Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared secondnameplaceholder a wanted man. The secondnameplaceholders—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. secondnameplaceholder met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.[34]Personal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The secondnameplaceholders—with difficulty—raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Danzig (now Gdańsk). secondnameplaceholder had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with epilepsy and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of secondnameplaceholder; her son was taken by his father. secondnameplaceholder was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925.[35] He was violent to the point where he had to be confined in a straitjacket, but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine.[36] Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry.[37] Hitler, who had written Mein Kampf while in prison, had been released in December 1924.[38] Carin secondnameplaceholder, ill with epilepsy and tuberculosis,[39] died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.Meanwhile, the Nazi Party was in a period of rebuilding and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate. The SA was reorganised, but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than secondnameplaceholder, and the Schutzstaffel (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In the May 1928 elections the Nazi Party only obtained 12 seats out of an available 491 in the Reichstag.[40] secondnameplaceholder was elected as a representative from Bavaria.[41]  He continued to be elected to the Reichstag in all subsequent elections during the Weimar and Nazi regimes.[42] The Great Depression led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and in the 1930 election, the Nazi Party won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats.[43] In May 1931, Hitler sent secondnameplaceholder on a mission to the Vatican, where he met the future Pope Pius XII.[44]In the July 1932 election, the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, the Nazis were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag, and elected secondnameplaceholder to the post.[45] He would retain this position until 23 April 1945.
<h2>Reichstag fire</h2>
The Reichstag fire occurred on the night of 27 February 1933. secondnameplaceholder was one of the first to arrive on the scene. Marinus van der Lubbe—a Communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. secondnameplaceholder immediately called for a crackdown on Communists.[46]The Nazis took advantage of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 Party members were arrested.[47] secondnameplaceholder demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order.[48] Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the Nazi Party itself was responsible for starting the fire.[49][50]At the Nuremberg trials, General Franz Halder testified that secondnameplaceholder admitted responsibility for starting the fire. He said that, at a luncheon held on Hitler's birthday in 1942, secondnameplaceholder said, "The only one who really knows about the Reichstag is I, because I set it on fire!"[51] In his own Nuremberg testimony, secondnameplaceholder denied this story.[52]
<h2>Second marriage</h2>
During the early 1930s, secondnameplaceholder was often in the company of Emmy Sonnemann, an actress from Hamburg.[53] They were married on 10 April 1935 in Berlin; the wedding was celebrated on a huge scale. A large reception was held the night before at the Berlin Opera House. Fighter aircraft flew overhead on the night of the reception and the day of the ceremony,[54] at which Hitler was best man.[55] secondnameplaceholder's daughter, Edda, was born on 2 June 1938.[56]
<h2>Nazi potentate</h2>
When Hitler was named chancellor of Germany in January 1933, secondnameplaceholder was appointed as minister without portfolio, Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation.[57] Wilhelm Frick was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick and head of the Schutzstaffel (SS) Heinrich Himmler hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but secondnameplaceholder on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with Rudolf Diels at its head. The force was called the Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police), or Gestapo. secondnameplaceholder, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.[58] By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.[59]Hitler was deeply concerned that Ernst Röhm, the chief of the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with secondnameplaceholder to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA.[60] Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; secondnameplaceholder personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives.[61] Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.[62]One of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to maintain an air force. After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg–Briand Pact, police aircraft were permitted. secondnameplaceholder was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged,[63] with secondnameplaceholder as Reich Aviation Minister.[64]During a cabinet meeting in September 1936, secondnameplaceholder and Hitler announced that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named secondnameplaceholder as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan to undertake this task. secondnameplaceholder created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, to the chagrin of Hjalmar Schacht, the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits.[65] Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937,[66] and Walther Funk took over the position, as well as control of the Reichsbank. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under secondnameplaceholder's control under the auspices of the Four Year Plan.[67] In July 1937, the Reichswerke firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was established under state ownership – though led by secondnameplaceholder – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.[68]In 1938, secondnameplaceholder was involved in the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, which led to the resignations of the War Minister, Generalfeldmarschall Werner von Blomberg, and the army commander, General Werner von Fritsch. secondnameplaceholder had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute.[69] secondnameplaceholder felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg. Blomberg was forced to resign. secondnameplaceholder did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign.[70] Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. secondnameplaceholder asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.[71]As minister in charge of the Four Year Plan, secondnameplaceholder became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg on 12 February 1938, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming.  The Nazi Party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, secondnameplaceholder telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm Miklas to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.[72]Although Joachim von Ribbentrop had been named Foreign Minister in February 1938, secondnameplaceholder continued to involve himself in foreign affairs.[56] That July, he contacted the British government with the idea that he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for Czechoslovakia. Neville Chamberlain was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, secondnameplaceholder visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the Nuremberg Rally that September, secondnameplaceholder and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered.[73] Chamberlain and Hitler had a series of meetings that led to the signing of the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany.[74] In March 1939, secondnameplaceholder threatened Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha with the bombing of Prague. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia.[75]Although many in the party disliked him,[76] before the war secondnameplaceholder enjoyed widespread personal popularity among the German public because of his perceived sociability, colour and humour.[77][78] As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself as a champion of national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on secondnameplaceholder's side. Other leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity.[77] In Britain and the United States, some viewed secondnameplaceholder as more acceptable than the other Nazis and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.[78]
<h2>World War II</h2>
secondnameplaceholder and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible.[79] On 30 August 1939, immediately prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Hitler appointed secondnameplaceholder as the chairman of a new six-person Council of Ministers for Defense of the Reich which was set up to operate as a war cabinet.[80] The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939.[81] Later in the day, speaking to the Reichstag, Hitler designated secondnameplaceholder as his successor as Führer of all Germany, "If anything should befall me",[82] with Hess as the second alternate.[76] Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the Polish Air Force was defeated within a week.[83] The Fallschirmjäger seized vital airfields in Norway and captured Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium. secondnameplaceholder's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the Battles of the Netherlands, Belgium and France in May 1940.[84]After the Fall of France, Hitler awarded secondnameplaceholder the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for his successful leadership.[85] During the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony, Hitler promoted secondnameplaceholder to the rank of Reichsmarschall des Grossdeutschen Reiches (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a specially-created rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of this promotion, he was the highest-ranking soldier in Germany until the end of the war. secondnameplaceholder had already received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.[85]The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry.[86] secondnameplaceholder had by then already announced in a radio speech, "If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!",[87] something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940.[88] Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, secondnameplaceholder, like Admiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine (navy),[89] was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed Operation Sea Lion).[90] secondnameplaceholder hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940.[91] After their defeat in the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via strategic bombing. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter.[92] By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by the Blitz, though the bombings continued through May 1941.[93]In spite of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the invasion of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft in the first month of fighting.[94] Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment.[95] But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow.[96] After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kyiv.[97] The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow.[97] Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.[98]Hitler decided that the summer 1942 campaign would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus.[99] The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war,[100] began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe.[101] The German Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded by the end of November in Operation Uranus, secondnameplaceholder promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day.[102][103] The remnants of the Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.[104]Meanwhile, the strength of the US and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began operations against German targets. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942.[105] Air raids continued on targets further from England after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on US fighter aircraft. secondnameplaceholder refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as Aachen in winter 1942–1943. His reputation began to decline.[106]The American P-51 Mustang, with a combat radius of over 1,800 miles (2,900 km) when using underwing drop tanks, began to escort the bombers in large formations to and from the target area in early 1944. From that point onwards, the Luftwaffe began to suffer casualties in aircrews it could not sufficiently replace. By targeting oil refineries and rail communications, Allied bombers crippled the German war effort by late 1944.[107] German civilians blamed secondnameplaceholder for his failure to protect the homeland.[108] Hitler began excluding him from conferences, but continued him in his positions at the head of the Luftwaffe and as plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan.[109] As he lost Hitler's trust, secondnameplaceholder began to spend more time at his various residences.[110] On D-Day (6 June 1944), the Luftwaffe only had some 300 fighters and a small number of bombers in the area of the landings; the Allies had a total strength of 11,000 aircraft.[111]As the Soviets approached Berlin, Hitler's efforts to organise the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile.[112] His last birthday, celebrated at the Führerbunker in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, secondnameplaceholder included. By this time, secondnameplaceholder's hunting lodge Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed,[113] and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere.[114] secondnameplaceholder arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.[115] He also stated that secondnameplaceholder was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement.[116]OKW operations chief Alfred Jodl was present for Hitler's rant, and notified secondnameplaceholder's chief of staff, Karl Koller, at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify secondnameplaceholder of this development. A week after the start of the Soviet invasion, Hitler had issued a decree naming secondnameplaceholder his successor in the event of his death, thus codifying the declaration he had made soon after the beginning of the war. The decree also gave secondnameplaceholder full authority to act as Hitler's deputy if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action.[116]secondnameplaceholder feared being branded a traitor if he tried to take power, but also feared being accused of dereliction of duty if he did nothing. After some hesitation, secondnameplaceholder reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers (the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery), secondnameplaceholder concluded that by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that under the terms of the decree, it was incumbent upon secondnameplaceholder to take power in Hitler's stead.[117] He was also motivated by fears that his rival, Martin Bormann, would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, secondnameplaceholder sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.[118]The telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that secondnameplaceholder was a traitor. Bormann argued that secondnameplaceholder's telegram was not a request for permission to act as Hitler's deputy, but a demand to resign or be overthrown.[119] Bormann also intercepted another telegram in which secondnameplaceholder directed Ribbentrop to report to him if there was no further communication from Hitler or secondnameplaceholder before midnight.[120] Hitler sent a reply to secondnameplaceholder—prepared with Bormann's help—rescinding the 1941 decree and threatening him with execution for high treason unless he immediately resigned from all of his offices. secondnameplaceholder duly resigned. Afterwards, Hitler (or Bormann, depending on the source) ordered the SS to place secondnameplaceholder, his staff, and Lammers under house arrest at Obersalzberg.[119][121] Bormann made an announcement over the radio that secondnameplaceholder had resigned for health reasons.[122]By 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg was under attack by the Allies, so secondnameplaceholder was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler expelled secondnameplaceholder from the party, formally rescinded the decree making him his successor, and upbraided secondnameplaceholder for "illegally attempting to seize control of the state."[123] He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. secondnameplaceholder was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the US Army.[124] This move likely saved secondnameplaceholder's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.[125]
<h2>Trial and death</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was flown to Camp Ashcan, a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at Mondorf-les-Bains, Luxembourg. Here he was weaned off dihydrocodeine (a mild morphine derivative)—he had been taking the equivalent of three or four grains (260 to 320 mg) of morphine a day—and was put on a strict diet; he lost 60 pounds (27 kg). His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138.[126] Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to Nuremberg, which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November.[127]secondnameplaceholder was the second-highest-ranking official tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled an indictment of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany of works of art and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the Nacht und Nebel (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, secondnameplaceholder declared himself to be "in the sense of the indictment not guilty".[128]The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and secondnameplaceholder's defence—the first to be presented—lasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946.[129] secondnameplaceholder, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of Hess, who was seated beside him.[130] During breaks in the proceedings, secondnameplaceholder tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony.[131] secondnameplaceholder told US psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn that the court was "stupid" to try "little fellows" like Funk and Kaltenbrunner instead of letting secondnameplaceholder take all the blame on himself.[132] He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.[132]On several occasions over the course of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including secondnameplaceholder, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Körner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray secondnameplaceholder as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.[133] When testifying on his own behalf, secondnameplaceholder emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.[134] During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, secondnameplaceholder had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom.[135] Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for secondnameplaceholder not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murders—the shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft III—in time to have prevented the killings.[136] He also presented clear evidence that secondnameplaceholder knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.[137]secondnameplaceholder was found guilty on all four counts and was sentenced to death by hanging. The judgment stated:secondnameplaceholder made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal, but the court refused.[139] He committed suicide with a potassium cyanide capsule the night before he was to be hanged.[140]One theory as to how secondnameplaceholder obtained the poison holds that US Army Lieutenant Jack G. Wheelis, who was stationed at the Nuremberg Trials, retrieved the capsules from their hiding place among secondnameplaceholder's personal effects that had been confiscated by the Army and handed them over to the prisoner,[141] after being bribed by secondnameplaceholder, who gave him his gold watch, pen, and cigarette case.[142] In 2005, former US Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers, who served in the 1st Infantry Division's 26th Infantry Regiment—the honour guard for the Nuremberg Trials—claimed he gave secondnameplaceholder "medicine" hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison. Stivers later said that he did not know what was in the pill until after secondnameplaceholder's suicide.[143]secondnameplaceholder's body, as with those of the men who were executed, was displayed at the execution ground for the witnesses of the executions. The bodies were cremated at Ostfriedhof, Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the Isar River.[144][145][146]
<h2>Personal properties</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's name is closely associated with the Nazi plunder of Jewish property. His name appears 135 times on the OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Red Flag Names List[147] compiled by US Army intelligence in 1945-6 and declassified in 1997.[148]The confiscation of Jewish property gave secondnameplaceholder the opportunity to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took kickbacks from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War via Pyrkal in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).[149]secondnameplaceholder was appointed Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around this time he became interested in Schorfheide Forest, where he set aside 100,000 acres (400 km2) as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, Carinhall, in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site and placed in a vault on the estate.[150] Through most of the 1930s, secondnameplaceholder kept pet lion cubs, borrowed from the Berlin Zoo, both at Carinhall and at his house at Obersalzberg.[151] The main lodge at Carinhall had a large art gallery where secondnameplaceholder displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward.[152][153] secondnameplaceholder worked closely with the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe.[154] Headed by Alfred Rosenberg, the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. secondnameplaceholder repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes.[155] The estimated value of his collection, which numbered some 1,500 pieces, was $200 million.[156]secondnameplaceholder was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing. He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held;[157] his Reichsmarschall uniform included a jewel-encrusted baton. Hans-Ulrich Rudel, the top Stuka pilot of the war, recalled twice meeting secondnameplaceholder dressed in outlandish costumes: first, a medieval hunting costume, practicing archery with his doctor; and second, dressed in a red toga fastened with a golden clasp, smoking an unusually large pipe. Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano once noted secondnameplaceholder wearing a fur coat that looked like what "a high grade prostitute wears to the opera."[158] He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.[159]secondnameplaceholder was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself.[160] Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave secondnameplaceholder an oversized marble bust of Hitler.[161] As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to secondnameplaceholder without even being asked. Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund.[162] For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated secondnameplaceholder with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.[163]The design of the Reichsmarschall standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold German eagle grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a swastika. The reverse side of the flag had the Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ("Grand Cross of the Iron Cross") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.Though he liked to be called "der Eiserne" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, "no matter how rude", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that "he sits down on his stomach".[164][165] One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: "Mission accomplished. Pope unfrocked. Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit."[166]
<h2>Role in the Holocaust</h2>
Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler were far more antisemitic than secondnameplaceholder, who mainly adopted that attitude because party politics required him to do so.[167] His deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But secondnameplaceholder supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.[167] He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.[168]At the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of Aryanization. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all.[168] Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews.[135] He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. "I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government", he claimed.[169]In July 1941, secondnameplaceholder issued a memo to Reinhard Heydrich ordering him to organise the practical details of the Final Solution to the "Jewish Question". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, Russia, and elsewhere. At the Wannsee Conference, held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. secondnameplaceholder did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.[170][171]secondnameplaceholder directed anti-partisan operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the Białowieża Forest between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.[172]Informational notesCitationsBibliographyFurther reading

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Dada Oumee (/ˈiːdi ɑːˈmiːn, ˈɪdi -/, UK also /- æˈmiːn/; c. 1925 – 16 August 2003) was a Ugandan military officer who served as the president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. He is considered one of the most brutal despots in world history.[2]secondnameplaceholder was born in Koboko to a Kakwa father and Lugbara mother. In 1946, he joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army as a cook. He rose to the rank of lieutenant, taking part in British actions against Somali rebels in the Shifta War and then the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya. Uganda gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, and secondnameplaceholder remained in the armed forces, rising to the position of major and being appointed commander of the Uganda Army in 1965. He became aware that Ugandan President Milton Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, so he launched a military coup in 1971 and declared himself president.During his years in power, secondnameplaceholder shifted from being a pro-Western ruler enjoying considerable support from Israel to being backed by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, the Soviet Union, and East Germany.[3][4][5] In 1975, secondnameplaceholder became the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), a Pan-Africanist group designed to promote solidarity among African states.[6] Uganda was a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights from 1977 to 1979.[7] The UK broke diplomatic relations with Uganda in 1977, and secondnameplaceholder declared that he had defeated the British and added "CBE" to his title for "Conqueror of the British Empire".[8]As secondnameplaceholder's rule progressed into the late 1970s, there was increased unrest against his persecution of certain ethnic groups and political dissidents, along with Uganda's very poor international standing due to secondnameplaceholder's support for the terrorist hijackers in Operation Entebbe. He then attempted to annex Tanzania's Kagera Region in 1978, so Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere had his troops invade Uganda; they captured Kampala on 11 April 1979 and ousted secondnameplaceholder from power. secondnameplaceholder went into exile, first in Libya, then Iraq, and finally in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003.[9]secondnameplaceholder's rule was characterised by rampant human rights abuses, including political repression, ethnic persecution and extrajudicial killings, as well as nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement. International observers and human rights groups estimate that between 100,000[10] and 500,000 people were killed under his regime.[8]
<h2>Biography</h2>
secondnameplaceholder did not write an autobiography, and he did not authorize an official written account of his life. There are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925.[a] Other unconfirmed sources state secondnameplaceholder's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. secondnameplaceholder's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.[13]According to Fred Guweddeko, a researcher at Makerere University, secondnameplaceholder was the son of Andreas Nyabire (1889–1976). Nyabire, a member of the Kakwa ethnic group, converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam in 1910 and changed his name to secondnameplaceholder Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in north-western Uganda. Guweddeko states that secondnameplaceholder's mother was Assa Aatte (1904–1970), an ethnic Lugbara and a traditional herbalist who treated members of Buganda royalty, among others.[11] Some sources have also described secondnameplaceholder as being of mixed Kakwa-Nubian origin.[14][b]secondnameplaceholder joined an Islamic school in Bombo in 1941. After a few years, he left school with only a fourth-grade English-language education, and did odd jobs before being recruited to the army by a British colonial army officer.[11]secondnameplaceholder joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army in 1946 as an assistant cook, while at the same time receiving military training until 1947.[8][18] In later life he falsely claimed to have served in the Burma Campaign of World War II.[8][19][20] He was transferred to Kenya for infantry service as a private in 1947, and served in the 21st KAR infantry battalion in Gilgil, Kenya Colony until 1949. That year, his unit was deployed to northern Kenya to fight against Somali rebels in the Shifta War. In 1952, his brigade was deployed against the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya. He was promoted to corporal the same year, then to sergeant in 1953.[11]In 1959, secondnameplaceholder was made afande class 2 (Warrant Officer),[21] the highest rank possible for a black African in the colonial British Army of that time. secondnameplaceholder returned to Uganda the same year and received a short-service commission as a lieutenant on 15 July 1961, becoming one of the first two Ugandans to become commissioned officers.[21] He was assigned to quell the cattle rustling between Uganda's Karamojong and Kenya's Turkana nomads.[11] According to researcher Holger Bernt Hansen, secondnameplaceholder's outlook, behaviour and strategies of communication were strongly influenced by his experiences in the colonial military. This included his direct and hands-on leadership style which would eventually contribute to his popularity among certain parts of Ugandan society.[22]In 1962, following Uganda's independence from the United Kingdom, secondnameplaceholder was promoted to captain and then, in 1963, to major. He was appointed Deputy Commander of the Army in 1964 and, the following year, to Commander of the Army.[11] In 1970, he was promoted to commander of all the armed forces.[23]secondnameplaceholder was an athlete during his time in both the British and Ugandan army. At 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) tall and powerfully built, he was the Ugandan light heavyweight boxing champion from 1951 to 1960, as well as a swimmer. secondnameplaceholder was also a formidable rugby forward,[24][25] although one officer said of him: "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is a splendid type and a good (rugby) player, but virtually bone from the neck up, and needs things explained in words of one letter".[25][26] In the 1950s, he played for Nile RFC.[27]There is a frequently repeated urban myth that he was selected as a replacement by the East Africa rugby union team for their 1955 tour match against the British Lions.[25][27] secondnameplaceholder, however, does not appear in the team photograph or on the official team list.[28] Following conversations with a colleague in the British Army, secondnameplaceholder became a keen fan of Hayes F.C. – an affection that remained for the rest of his life.[29]In 1965, Prime Minister Milton Obote and secondnameplaceholder were implicated in a deal to smuggle ivory and gold into Uganda from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The deal, as later alleged by General Nicholas Olenga, an associate of the former Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, was part of an arrangement to help troops opposed to the Congolese government trade ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by secondnameplaceholder. In 1966, the Ugandan Parliament demanded an investigation. Obote imposed a new constitution abolishing the ceremonial presidency held by Kabaka (King) Mutesa II of Buganda, and declared himself executive president. He promoted secondnameplaceholder to colonel and army commander. secondnameplaceholder led an attack on the Kabaka's palace and forced Mutesa into exile to the United Kingdom, where he remained until his death in 1969.[30][31]secondnameplaceholder began recruiting members of Kakwa, Lugbara, South Sudanese, and other ethnic groups from the West Nile area bordering South Sudan. The South Sudanese had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from South Sudan to serve the colonial army. Many African ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and South Sudan; allegations persist that secondnameplaceholder's army consisted mainly of South Sudanese soldiers.[32]Eventually a rift developed between secondnameplaceholder and Obote, exacerbated by the support secondnameplaceholder had built within the Uganda Army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote took control of the armed forces, reducing secondnameplaceholder from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of the commander of the Uganda Army.[23]Having learned that Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, secondnameplaceholder seized power in a military coup on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to secondnameplaceholder sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported in the streets of Kampala after the radio broadcast.[33] secondnameplaceholder announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be announced when the situation was normalised. He promised to release all political prisoners.[34]secondnameplaceholder held a state funeral in April 1971 for Edward Mutesa, former king (kabaka) of Buganda and president who had died in exile; freed many political prisoners; and reiterated his promise to hold free and fair elections to return the country to democratic rule in the shortest period possible.[35]On 2 February 1971, one week after the coup, secondnameplaceholder declared himself President of Uganda, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Uganda Army Chief of Staff, and Chief of Air Staff. He announced that he was suspending certain provisions of the Ugandan constitution, and soon instituted an Advisory Defence Council composed of military officers with himself as the chairman. secondnameplaceholder placed military tribunals above the system of civil law, appointed soldiers to top government posts and parastatal agencies, and informed the newly inducted civilian cabinet ministers that they would be subject to military courtesy.[23][36] secondnameplaceholder ruled by decree, and over the course of his rule he issued approximately 30 decrees.[37][38]secondnameplaceholder renamed the presidential lodge in Kampala from Government House to "The Command Post". He disbanded the General Service Unit (GSU), an intelligence agency created by the previous government, and replaced it with the State Research Bureau (SRB). SRB headquarters at the Kampala suburb of Nakasero became the scene of torture and executions over the next few years.[39] Other agencies used to persecute dissenters included the military police and the Public Safety Unit (PSU).[39]Obote took refuge in Tanzania, having been offered sanctuary there by the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. Obote was soon joined by 20,000 Ugandan refugees fleeing secondnameplaceholder. The exiles attempted but failed to regain Uganda in 1972, through a poorly organised coup attempt.[40]secondnameplaceholder retaliated against the attempted invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging the Uganda Army of Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups.[41] In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks.[42] By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and at least twice as many civilians, had disappeared.[43] The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.[44]The killings, motivated by ethnic, political, and financial factors, continued throughout secondnameplaceholder's eight years in control.[43] The exact number of people killed is unknown. The International Commission of Jurists estimated the death toll at no fewer than 80,000 and more likely around 300,000. An estimate compiled by exile organisations with the help of Amnesty International puts the number killed at 500,000.[8]Among the most prominent people killed were Benedicto Kiwanuka, a former prime minister and chief justice; Janani Luwum, the Anglican archbishop; Joseph Mubiru, the former governor of the central bank of Uganda; Frank Kalimuzo, the vice-chancellor of Makerere University; Byron Kawadwa, a prominent playwright; and two of secondnameplaceholder's own cabinet ministers, Erinayo Wilson Oryema and Charles Oboth Ofumbi.[45]secondnameplaceholder recruited his followers from his own ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of these groups even though they were only 5 percent of the population. This helps explain why secondnameplaceholder survived eight attempted coups.[46] The Uganda Army grew from 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. secondnameplaceholder's military was largely a mercenary force. Half the soldiers were South Sudanese and 26 percent Congolese, with only 24 percent being Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.[47]In August 1972, secondnameplaceholder declared what he called an "economic war", a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly from the Indian subcontinent and born in the country, their ancestors having come to Uganda in search of prosperity when India was still a British colony.[49] Many owned businesses, including large-scale enterprises, which formed the backbone of the Ugandan economy.[50][51][52]On 4 August 1972, secondnameplaceholder issued a decree ordering the expulsion of the 50,000 Asians who were British passport holders. This was later amended to include all 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians emigrated to the UK. Others went to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Fiji, or to India, Kenya, Pakistan, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States.[50][51][52] secondnameplaceholder expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and the Europeans and handed them over to his supporters. Without the experienced owners and proprietors, businesses were mismanaged and many industries collapsed from lack of operational expertise and maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining Ugandan economy.[36]In 1975, Emmanuel Blayo Wakhweya, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's finance minister and longest-serving cabinet member at the time, defected in London.[53] This prominent defection helped Henry Kyemba, secondnameplaceholder's health minister and a former official of the first Obote regime, to defect in 1977 and resettle in the UK. Kyemba wrote and published A State of Blood, the first insider exposé of secondnameplaceholder's rule.[54]On 25 June 1976, the Defence Council declared secondnameplaceholder president for life.[55]Initially, secondnameplaceholder was supported by Western powers such as Israel, West Germany, and, in particular, Great Britain. During the late 1960s, Obote's move to the left, which included his Common Man's Charter and the nationalisation of 80 British companies, had made the West worried that he would pose a threat to Western capitalist interests in Africa and make Uganda an ally of the Soviet Union. secondnameplaceholder, who had served with the King's African Rifles and taken part in Britain's suppression of the Mau Mau uprising prior to Ugandan independence, was known by the British as "intensely loyal to Britain". This made him an obvious choice as Obote's successor. Although some have claimed that secondnameplaceholder was being groomed for power as early as 1966, the plotting by the British and other Western powers began in earnest in 1969, after Obote had begun his nationalisation programme.[56]Following the expulsion of Ugandan Asians in 1972, most of whom were of Indian descent, India severed diplomatic relations with Uganda. The same year, as part of his "economic war", secondnameplaceholder broke diplomatic ties with the UK and nationalised all British-owned businesses.[57]That year, relations with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 secondnameplaceholder expelled Israeli military advisers and turned to Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and the Soviet Union for support.[41] secondnameplaceholder became an outspoken critic of Israel.[58] In return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to secondnameplaceholder.[59] In the 1974 French-produced documentary film General firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Dada: A Self Portrait, secondnameplaceholder discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers, and suicide squadrons.[19]The Soviet Union became secondnameplaceholder's largest arms supplier.[4] East Germany was involved in the General Service Unit and the State Research Bureau, the two agencies that were most notorious for terror. Later during the Ugandan invasion of Tanzania in 1979, East Germany attempted to remove evidence of its involvement with these agencies.[5]In 1973, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Patrick Melady recommended that the United States reduce its presence in Uganda. Melady described secondnameplaceholder's regime as "racist, erratic and unpredictable, brutal, inept, bellicose, irrational, ridiculous, and militaristic".[60]In June 1976, secondnameplaceholder allowed an Air France airliner from Tel Aviv to Paris hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO) and two members of the German Revolutionäre Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. The hijackers were joined there by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage.[61] In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), on the night of 3–4 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos flew in from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; 7 hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 1 Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu (the commander of the unit), were killed. Netanyahu was the older brother of Benjamin Netanyahu, the later Israeli prime-minister. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala before the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its High Commission in Uganda.[62] In retaliation for Kenya's assistance in the raid, secondnameplaceholder also ordered the killing of hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda.[63]Uganda under secondnameplaceholder embarked on a large military build-up, which raised concerns in Kenya. Early in June 1975, Kenyan officials impounded a large convoy of Soviet-made arms en route to Uganda at the port of Mombasa. Tension between Uganda and Kenya reached its climax in February 1976, when secondnameplaceholder announced that he would investigate the possibility that parts of southern Sudan and western and central Kenya, up to within 32 kilometres (20 mi) of Nairobi, were historically a part of colonial Uganda. The Kenyan Government responded with a stern statement that Kenya would not part with "a single inch of territory". secondnameplaceholder backed down after the Kenyan army deployed troops and armoured personnel carriers along the Kenya–Uganda border.[64] secondnameplaceholder's relations with Rwanda were tense, and during his tenure he repeatedly jeopardized its economy by denying its commercial vehicles transit to Mombasa and made multiple threats to bomb Kigali.[65]In January 1977 secondnameplaceholder appointed General Mustafa Adrisi Vice President of Uganda.[66][67] That year, a split in the Uganda Army developed between supporters of secondnameplaceholder and soldiers loyal to Adrisi, who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners, particularly Sudanese, from the military.[68] By 1978, the number of secondnameplaceholder's supporters and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed as a result of the years of neglect and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of secondnameplaceholder's ministers defected or fled into exile.[69] In early 1978, Adrisi was severely injured in a car accident and flown to Cairo for treatment. While he was there, secondnameplaceholder stripped him of his positions as Minister of Defence and Minister of Home Affairs and denounced him for retiring senior prison officials without his knowledge. secondnameplaceholder then proceeded to purge several high-ranking officials from his government[70] and took personal control of several ministerial portfolios. The shakeup caused political unrest and especially angered Adrisi's followers, who believed that the car accident was a failed assassination attempt.[71]In November 1978, troops loyal to Adrisi mutinied. secondnameplaceholder sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border.[36] Fighting consequently broke out along the Ugandan–Tanzanian border, and the Uganda Army launched an invasion of Tanzanian territory under unclear circumstances.[72] According to several experts and politicians, secondnameplaceholder directly ordered the invasion in an attempt to distract the Ugandan military and public from the crisis at home.[73][74] Other accounts suggest, however, that secondnameplaceholder had lost control of parts of the Uganda Army. Accordingly, the invading troops acted without his orders, and secondnameplaceholder sanctioned the invasion post facto to save face.[75][76] In any case, secondnameplaceholder accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of initiating the war against Uganda after the hostilities had erupted, and proclaimed the annexation of a section of Kagera when the Ugandan invasion initially proved to be successful.[36][40]In January 1979, Nyerere mobilised the Tanzania People's Defence Force and counterattacked, joined by several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). secondnameplaceholder's army retreated steadily, despite military help from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi[18] and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).[77] The President reportedly made several trips abroad to other countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the war, attempting to enlist more foreign support.[78][79] He made few public appearances in the final months of his rule, but spoke frequently on radio and television.[80] Following a major defeat in the Battle of Lukaya, parts of the Uganda Army command reportedly urged secondnameplaceholder to step down. He angrily refused, and declared: "If you don't want to fight, I'll do it myself." He consequently fired chief of staff Yusuf Gowon.[81][82] However, secondnameplaceholder was forced to flee the Ugandan capital by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured.[18] After a short-lived attempt to rally some remnants of the Uganda Army in eastern Uganda[83][84] which reportedly included secondnameplaceholder proclaiming the city of Jinja his country's new capital,[85] he fled into exile. secondnameplaceholder first escaped to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for staying out of politics.[18] secondnameplaceholder lived for a number of years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda–Tanzania War for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed secondnameplaceholder (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located secondnameplaceholder in 1980, and secured the first interview with him since his deposition.[86] While in exile, secondnameplaceholder funded remnants of his army that fought in the Ugandan Bush War.[87] Though he continued to be a controversial figure, some of secondnameplaceholder's former followers as well as several rebel groups continued to fight in his name for decades,[88] and occasionally advocated for his amnesty[89] and even his restoration to Ugandan Presidency.[90] During interviews he gave during his exile in Saudi Arabia, secondnameplaceholder held that Uganda needed him, and never expressed remorse for the brutal nature of his regime.[91]In 1989, secondnameplaceholder left his exile without authorization by the Saudi Arabian government, and flew alongside one of his sons to Zaire. There, he intended to mobilize a rebel force to reconquer Uganda[92][93] which was engulfed in another civil war at the time.[94] The rest of his family stayed in Jeddah.[93] Despite using a false Zairean passport, secondnameplaceholder was easily recognized upon arriving with Air Zaïre at N'djili Airport, and promptly arrested by Zairean security forces. The Zairean government reacted unfavorably to secondnameplaceholder's arrival, and attempted to expel him from the country.[95] At first, Saudi Arabia refused to allow him to return,[92][93] as its government was deeply offended that he had "abused their hospitality" by leaving without permission.[96] The Zairean government wanted neither to extradite secondnameplaceholder to Uganda where the ex-president faced murder charges nor keeping him in Zaire, thereby straining international relations. As a result, secondnameplaceholder was initially expelled to Senegal from where he was supposed to be sent to Saudi Arabia, but the Senegalese government sent him back to Zaire when Saudi Arabia continued to refuse secondnameplaceholder a visa.[93][96] Following appeals by Moroccan King Hassan II, the Saudi Arabian leadership finally relented and allowed secondnameplaceholder to return.[92][96] In return, secondnameplaceholder had to promise to never again participate in any political or military activities or give interviews. He consequently spent the remainder of his life peacefully and quietly in Saudi Arabia.[92]In the final years of his life, secondnameplaceholder reportedly ate a fruitarian diet.[97] His daily consumption of oranges earned him the nickname "Dr. Jaffa" among Saudi Arabians.[98][99]On 19 July 2003, secondnameplaceholder's fourth wife, Nalongo Madina, reported that he was in a coma and near death at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from kidney failure. She pleaded with the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, to allow him to return to Uganda for the remainder of his life. Museveni replied that secondnameplaceholder would have to "answer for his sins the moment he was brought back".[100] secondnameplaceholder's family eventually decided to disconnect life support, and secondnameplaceholder consequently died at the hospital in Jeddah on 16 August 2003. He was buried in Ruwais Cemetery in Jeddah in a simple grave, without any fanfare.[101]After secondnameplaceholder's death, David Owen revealed that during his term as the British Foreign Secretary (1977 to 1979), he had proposed having secondnameplaceholder assassinated. He has defended this, arguing: "I'm not ashamed of considering it, because his regime goes down in the scale of Pol Pot as one of the worst of all African regimes".[102]
<h2>Family and associates</h2>
A polygamist, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder married at least six women, three of whom he divorced. He married his first and second wives, Malyamu and Kay, in 1966. In 1967, he married Nora, and then married Nalongo Madina in 1972. On 26 March 1974, he announced on Radio Uganda that he had divorced Malyamu, Nora, and Kay.[103][104] Malyamu was arrested in Tororo on the Kenyan border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a bolt of fabric into Kenya.[103][105] In 1974, Kay secondnameplaceholder died under mysterious circumstances, with her body found dismembered.[106] Nora fled to Zaire in 1979; her current whereabouts are unknown.[105]In July 1975, secondnameplaceholder staged a £2 million wedding to 19-year-old Sarah Kyolaba, a go-go dancer with the Revolutionary Suicide Mechanised Regiment Band, nicknamed "Suicide Sarah".[107] The wedding was held during the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit meeting in Kampala, and the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat served as secondnameplaceholder's best man.[108] Before she met secondnameplaceholder, Sarah was living with a boyfriend, Jesse Gitta; he vanished and it is not clear if he was beheaded, or detained after fleeing to Kenya.[107] The couple had four children and enjoyed rally race driving secondnameplaceholder's Citroën SM, with Sarah as navigator.[107] Sarah was a hairdresser in Tottenham when she died in 2015.[108]By 1993, secondnameplaceholder was living with the last nine of his children and one wife, Mama a Chumaru, the mother of the youngest four of his children. His last known child, daughter Iman, was born in 1992.[109] According to The Monitor, secondnameplaceholder married again a few months before his death in 2003.[105]secondnameplaceholder fathered up to near 60 children.[c] Until 2003, Taban secondnameplaceholder (born 1955),[112] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's eldest son, was the leader of West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of Yoweri Museveni. In 2005, he was offered amnesty by Museveni, and in 2006, he was appointed Deputy Director General of the Internal Security Organisation.[113] Another of secondnameplaceholder's sons, Haji Ali secondnameplaceholder, ran for election as Chairman (i.e. mayor) of Njeru Town Council in 2002 but was not elected.[114] In early 2007, the award-winning film The Last King of Scotland prompted one of his sons, Jaffar secondnameplaceholder (born in 1967),[115] to speak out in his father's defence. Jaffar secondnameplaceholder said he was writing a book to rehabilitate his father's reputation.[116] Jaffar is the tenth of secondnameplaceholder's 40 official children by seven official wives.[115]Among secondnameplaceholder's closest associates was the Briton Bob Astles.[117] Isaac Maliyamungu was an instrumental affiliate and one of the more feared officers in secondnameplaceholder's army.[69]
<h2>Character</h2>
In course of his career, secondnameplaceholder gained a numerous nicknames, many of them derogatory:As the years progressed, secondnameplaceholder's behaviour became more erratic, unpredictable, and strident. After the United Kingdom broke off all diplomatic relations with his regime in 1977, secondnameplaceholder declared that he had defeated the British, and he conferred on himself the decoration of CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire). His full self-bestowed title ultimately became: "His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular", in addition to his officially stated claim of being the uncrowned king of Scotland.[127] He never received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) or the Military Cross (MC). He conferred a doctorate of law on himself from Makerere University as well as the Victorious Cross (VC), a medal made to emulate the British Victoria Cross.[6][128]secondnameplaceholder became the subject of rumours, including a widespread belief that he was a cannibal.[129] secondnameplaceholder reportedly also boasted that he kept the decapitated heads of political enemies in his freezer, although he said that human flesh was generally "too salty" for his taste.[130] Some of the rumours, such as the mutilation of one of his wives, were spread and popularised by the 1980 film Rise and Fall of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and alluded to in the film The Last King of Scotland in 2006, a movie which earned actor Forest Whitaker an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of secondnameplaceholder.[131]During secondnameplaceholder's time in power, popular media outside of Uganda often portrayed him as an essentially comic and eccentric figure. Julius Harris emphasized secondnameplaceholder's allegedly clownish side in Victory at Entebbe, while Yaphet Kotto drew more praise for projecting secondnameplaceholder's sinister nature in Raid on Entebbe. In a 1977 assessment typical of the time, a Time magazine article described him as a "killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting martinet".[132] The comedy-variety series Saturday Night Live aired four secondnameplaceholder sketches between 1976 and 1979, including one in which he was an ill-behaved houseguest in exile, and another in which he was a spokesman against venereal disease.[133] In 1979, radio host Don Imus made multiple on-air telephone calls in an attempt to talk to secondnameplaceholder, and later hosted a phony interview with him that was deemed "very dirty."[134] In a Benny Hill Show episode transmitted in January 1977, Hill portrayed secondnameplaceholder sitting behind a desk that featured a placard reading "ME TARZAN, U GANDA".[135]The foreign media were often criticised by Ugandan exiles and defectors for emphasising secondnameplaceholder's self-aggrandizing eccentricities and taste for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behaviour.[136] Other commentators even suggested that secondnameplaceholder had deliberately cultivated his eccentric reputation in the foreign media as an easily parodied buffoon in order to defuse international concern over his administration of Uganda.[137]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
Gender historian Alicia Decker wrote that the "deeply embedded culture of militarism in Uganda is undoubtedly secondnameplaceholder's most enduring legacy."[138] His reputation in Uganda has been viewed over the decades following his rule in more complex ways than in the international community. Some Ugandans have praised him as a "patriot" and supported his decision to expel Asians from the country.[139] At the time of his death, he was particularly well regarded in north-western Uganda.[140] One of secondnameplaceholder's sons, Jaffar Remo, criticised the negative public perception of his father and called for a commission to investigate the veracity of the abuses committed under his rule.[141]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was an unidentified serial killer active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts, the killer was called the Whitechapel Murderer and Leather Apron.Attacks ascribed to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London. Their throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and numerous letters were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard from individuals purporting to be the murderer. The name "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" originated in a letter written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The "From Hell" letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee came with half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder", mainly because of both the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders and media coverage of the crimes.Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on secondnameplaceholder, and the legend solidified. A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal murders committed in Whitechapel and Spitalfields between 1888 and 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888. Five victims—Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly—are known as the "canonical five" and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked. The murders were never solved, and the legends surrounding these crimes became a combination of historical research, folklore, and pseudohistory.
<h2>Background</h2>
In the mid-19th century, Britain experienced an influx of Irish immigrants who swelled the populations of the major cities, including the East End of London. From 1882, Jewish refugees fleeing pogroms in Tsarist Russia and other areas of Eastern Europe emigrated into the same area.[2] The parish of Whitechapel in London's East End became increasingly overcrowded, with the population increasing to approximately 80,000 inhabitants by 1888.[3] Work and housing conditions worsened, and a significant economic underclass developed.[4] Fifty-five percent of children born in the East End died before they were five years old.[5] Robbery, violence, and alcohol dependency were commonplace,[3] and the endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution to survive on a daily basis.[6]In October 1888, London's Metropolitan Police Service estimated that there were 62 brothels and 1,200 women working as prostitutes in Whitechapel,[7] with approximately 8,500 people residing in the 233 common lodging-houses within Whitechapel every night,[3] with the nightly price for a single bed being fourpence[8] and the cost of sleeping upon a "lean-to" ("Hang-over") rope stretched across the dormitory being two pence per person.[9]The economic problems in Whitechapel were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions. Between 1886 and 1889, frequent demonstrations led to police intervention and public unrest, such as Bloody Sunday (1887).[10] Anti-semitism, crime, nativism, racism, social disturbance, and severe deprivation influenced public perceptions that Whitechapel was a notorious den of immorality.[11] Such perceptions were strengthened in the autumn of 1888 when the series of vicious and grotesque murders attributed to "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" received unprecedented coverage in the media.[12]
<h2>Murders</h2>
The large number of attacks against women in the East End during this time adds uncertainty to how many victims were murdered by the same individual.[13] Eleven separate murders, stretching from 3 April 1888 to 13 February 1891, were included in a London Metropolitan Police Service investigation and were known collectively in the police docket as the "Whitechapel murders".[14][15] Opinions vary as to whether these murders should be linked to the same culprit, but five of the eleven Whitechapel murders, known as the "canonical five", are widely believed to be the work of secondnameplaceholder.[16] Most experts point to deep slash wounds to the throat, followed by extensive abdominal and genital-area mutilation, the removal of internal organs, and progressive facial mutilations as the distinctive features of secondnameplaceholder's modus operandi.[17] The first two cases in the Whitechapel murders file, those of Emma Elizabeth Smith and Martha Tabram, are not included in the canonical five.[18]Smith was robbed and sexually assaulted in Osborn Street, Whitechapel, at approximately 1:30 a.m. on 3 April 1888. She had been bludgeoned about the face and received a cut to her ear.[19] A blunt object was also inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis and died the following day at London Hospital.[20] Smith stated that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of whom she described as a teenager.[21] This attack was linked to the later murders by the press,[22] but most authors attribute Smith's murder to general East End gang violence unrelated to secondnameplaceholder case.[14][23][24]Tabram was murdered on a staircase landing in George Yard, Whitechapel, on 7 August 1888;[25] she had suffered 39 stab wounds to her throat, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, stomach, and abdomen, with additional knife wounds inflicted to her breasts and vagina.[26] All but one of Tabram's wounds had been inflicted with a bladed instrument such as a penknife, and with one possible exception, all the wounds had been inflicted by a right-handed individual.[25] Tabram had not been raped.[27]The savagery of this murder, the lack of an obvious motive, and the closeness of the location and date to the later canonical Ripper murders led police to link this murder to those later committed by firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[28] However, this murder differs from the later canonical murders because although Tabram had been repeatedly stabbed, she had not suffered any slash wounds to her throat or abdomen. Many experts do not connect Tabram's murder with the later murders because of this difference in the wound pattern.[29]The canonical five Ripper victims are Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly.[30]The body of Mary Ann Nichols was discovered at about 3:40 a.m. on Friday 31 August 1888 in Buck's Row (now Durward Street), Whitechapel. Nichols had last been seen alive approximately one hour before the discovery of her body by a Mrs Emily Holland, with whom she had previously shared a bed at a common lodging-house in Thrawl Street, Spitalfields, walking in the direction of Whitechapel Road.[31] Her throat was severed by two deep cuts, one of which completely severed all the tissue down to the vertebrae.[32] Her vagina had been stabbed twice,[33] and the lower part of her abdomen was partly ripped open by a deep, jagged wound, causing her bowels to protrude.[34] Several other incisions inflicted to both sides of her abdomen had also been caused by the same knife; each of these wounds had been inflicted in a downward thrusting manner.[35]One week later, on Saturday 8 September 1888, the body of Annie Chapman was discovered at approximately 6 a.m. near the steps to the doorway of the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. As in the case of Mary Ann Nichols, the throat was severed by two deep cuts.[36] Her abdomen had been cut entirely open, with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh—plus her small intestines—being removed and placed above her right shoulder.[37] Chapman's autopsy also revealed that her uterus and sections of her bladder and vagina[38] had been removed.[39]At the inquest into Chapman's murder, Elizabeth Long described having seen Chapman standing outside 29 Hanbury Street at about 5:30 a.m.[40] in the company of a dark-haired man wearing a brown deer-stalker hat and dark overcoat, and of a "shabby-genteel" appearance.[41] According to this eyewitness, the man had asked Chapman the question, "Will you?" to which Chapman had replied, "Yes."[42]Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were both killed in the early morning hours of Sunday 30 September 1888. Stride's body was discovered at approximately 1 a.m. in Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street (now Henriques Street) in Whitechapel.[43] The cause of death was a single clear-cut incision, measuring six inches across her neck which had severed her left carotid artery and her trachea before terminating beneath her right jaw.[44] The absence of any further mutilations to her body has led to uncertainty as to whether Stride's murder was committed by secondnameplaceholder, or whether he was interrupted during the attack.[45] Several witnesses later informed police they had seen Stride in the company of a man in or close to Berner Street on the evening of 29 September and in the early hours of 30 September,[46] but each gave differing descriptions: some said that her companion was fair, others dark; some said that he was shabbily dressed, others well-dressed.[47]Eddowes's body was found in Mitre Square in the City of London, three-quarters of an hour after the discovery of the body of Elizabeth Stride. Her throat was severed and her abdomen ripped open by a long, deep and jagged wound before her intestines had been placed over her right shoulder. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed, and her face had been disfigured, with her nose severed, her cheek slashed, and cuts measuring a quarter of an inch and a half an inch respectively vertically incised through each of her eyelids.[48] A triangular incision—the apex of which pointed towards Eddowes's eye—had also been carved upon each of her cheeks,[49] and a section of the auricle and lobe of her right ear was later recovered from her clothing.[50] The police surgeon who conducted the post mortem upon Eddowes's body stated his opinion these mutilations would have taken "at least five minutes" to complete.[51]A local cigarette salesman named Joseph Lawende had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder, and he described seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes.[52] Lawende's companions were unable to confirm his description.[52] The murders of Stride and Eddowes ultimately became known as the "double event".[53][54]A section of Eddowes's bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel, at 2:55 a.m.[55] A chalk inscription upon the wall directly above this piece of apron read: "The Juwes are The men That Will not be Blamed for nothing."[56] This graffito became known as the Goulston Street graffito. The message appeared to imply that a Jew or Jews in general were responsible for the series of murders, but it is unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer on dropping the section of apron, or was merely incidental and nothing to do with the case.[57] Such graffiti were commonplace in Whitechapel. Police Commissioner Charles Warren feared that the graffito might spark anti-semitic riots and ordered the writing washed away before dawn.[58]The extensively mutilated and disembowelled body of Mary Jane Kelly was discovered lying on the bed in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, off Dorset Street, Spitalfields, at 10:45 a.m. on Friday 9 November 1888. Her face had been "hacked beyond all recognition",[59] with her throat severed down to the spine, and the abdomen almost emptied of its organs.[60] Her uterus, kidneys and one breast had been placed beneath her head, and other viscera from her body placed beside her foot,[61] about the bed and sections of her abdomen and thighs upon a bedside table. The heart was missing from the crime scene.[62]Multiple ashes found within the fireplace at 13 Miller's Court suggested Kelly's murderer had burned several combustible items to illuminate the single room as he mutilated her body. A recent fire had been severe enough to melt the solder between a kettle and its spout, which had fallen into the grate of the fireplace.[63]Each of the canonical five murders was perpetrated at night, on or close to a weekend, either at the end of a month or a week (or so) after.[64] The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted.[65] Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus and sections of her bladder and vagina were taken; Eddowes had her uterus and left kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was extensively eviscerated, with her face "gashed in all directions" and the tissue of her neck being severed to the bone, although the heart was the sole body organ missing from this crime scene.[66]Historically, the belief these five canonical murders were committed by the same perpetrator is derived from contemporary documents which link them together to the exclusion of others.[67] In 1894, Sir Melville Macnaghten, Assistant Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police Service and Head of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), wrote a report that stated: "the Whitechapel murderer had 5 victims—& 5 victims only".[68] Similarly, the canonical five victims were linked together in a letter written by police surgeon Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, head of the London CID, on 10 November 1888.[69]Some researchers have posited that some of the murders were undoubtedly the work of a single killer, but an unknown larger number of killers acting independently were responsible for the other crimes.[70] Authors Stewart P. Evans and Donald Rumbelow argue that the canonical five is a "Ripper myth" and that three cases (Nichols, Chapman, and Eddowes) can be definitely linked to the same perpetrator, but that less certainty exists as to whether Stride and Kelly were also murdered by the same individual.[71] Conversely, others suppose that the six murders between Tabram and Kelly were the work of a single killer.[17] Dr Percy Clark, assistant to the examining pathologist George Bagster Phillips, linked only three of the murders and thought that the others were perpetrated by "weak-minded individual[s] ... induced to emulate the crime".[72] Macnaghten did not join the police force until the year after the murders, and his memorandum contains serious factual errors about possible suspects.[73]Mary Jane Kelly is generally considered to be secondnameplaceholder's final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration.[23] The Whitechapel murders file details another four murders that occurred after the canonical five: those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, the Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.[25][74]The strangled body of 26-year-old Rose Mylett[75] was found in Clarke's Yard, High Street, Poplar on 20 December 1888.[76] There was no sign of a struggle, and the police believed that she had either accidentally hanged herself with her collar while in a drunken stupor or committed suicide.[77] However, faint markings left by a cord on one side of her neck suggested Mylett had been strangled.[78][79] At the inquest into Mylett's death, the jury returned a verdict of murder.[77]Alice McKenzie was murdered shortly after midnight on 17 July 1889 in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. She had suffered two stab wounds to her neck, and her left carotid artery had been severed. Several minor bruises and cuts were found on her body, which also bore a seven-inch long superficial wound extending from her left breast to her navel.[80] One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed.[81] Opinions among writers are also divided between those who suspect McKenzie's murderer copied the modus operandi of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder to deflect suspicion from himself,[82] and those who ascribe this murder to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[83]"The Pinchin Street torso" was a decomposing headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman aged between 30 and 40 discovered beneath a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel, on 10 September 1889.[84] Bruising about the victim's back, hip, and arm indicated the decedent had been extensively beaten shortly before her death. The victim's abdomen was also extensively mutilated, although her genitals had not been wounded.[85] She appeared to have been killed approximately one day prior to the discovery of her torso.[86] The dismembered sections of the body are believed to have been transported to the railway arch, hidden under an old chemise.[87]At 2:15 a.m. on 13 February 1891, PC Ernest Thompson discovered a 25-year-old prostitute named Frances Coles lying beneath a railway arch at Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel. Her throat had been deeply cut but her body was not mutilated, leading some to believe Thompson had disturbed her assailant. Coles was still alive, although she died before medical help could arrive.[89] A 53-year-old stoker, James Thomas Sadler, had earlier been seen drinking with Coles, and the two are known to have argued approximately three hours before her death. Sadler was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. He was briefly thought to be secondnameplaceholder,[90] but was later discharged from court for lack of evidence on 3 March 1891.[90]In addition to the eleven Whitechapel murders, commentators have linked other attacks to secondnameplaceholder. In the case of "Fairy Fay", it is unclear whether this attack was real or fabricated as a part of Ripper lore.[91] "Fairy Fay" was a nickname given to an unidentified[92] woman whose body was allegedly found in a doorway close to Commercial Road on 26 December 1887[93] "after a stake had been thrust through her abdomen",[94][95] but there were no recorded murders in Whitechapel at or around Christmas 1887.[96] "Fairy Fay" seems to have been created through a confused press report of the murder of Emma Elizabeth Smith, who had a stick or other blunt object shoved into her vagina.[97] Most authors agree that the victim "Fairy Fay" never existed.[91][92]A 38-year-old widow named Annie Millwood was admitted to the Whitechapel Workhouse Infirmary with numerous stab wounds to her legs and lower torso on 25 February 1888,[98] informing staff she had been attacked with a clasp knife by an unknown man.[99] She was later discharged, but died from apparently natural causes on 31 March.[92] Millwood was later postulated to be secondnameplaceholder's first victim, although this attack cannot be definitively linked to the perpetrator.[100]Another suspected precanonical victim was a young dressmaker named Ada Wilson,[101] who reportedly survived being stabbed twice in the neck with a clasp knife[102] upon the doorstep of her home in Bow on 28 March 1888.[103] A further possible victim, 40-year-old Annie Farmer, resided at the same lodging house as Martha Tabram[104] and reported an attack on 21 November 1888. She had received a superficial cut to her throat. Although an unknown man with blood on his mouth and hands had run out of this lodging house, shouting, "Look at what she has done!" before two eyewitnesses heard Farmer scream,[105] her wound was light, and possibly self-inflicted.[106][107]"The Whitehall Mystery" was a term coined for the discovery of a headless torso of a woman on 2 October 1888 in the basement of the new Metropolitan Police headquarters being built in Whitehall. An arm and shoulder belonging to the body were previously discovered floating in the River Thames near Pimlico on 11 September, and the left leg was subsequently discovered buried near where the torso was found on 17 October.[108] The other limbs and head were never recovered and the body was never identified. The mutilations were similar to those in the Pinchin Street torso case, where the legs and head were severed but not the arms.[109]Both the Whitehall Mystery and the Pinchin Street case may have been part of a series of murders known as the "Thames Mysteries", committed by a single serial killer dubbed the "Torso killer".[110] It is debatable whether firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and the "Torso killer" were the same person or separate serial killers active in the same area.[110] The modus operandi of the Torso killer differed from that of secondnameplaceholder, and police at the time discounted any connection between the two.[111]  Only one of the four victims linked to the Torso killer was identified, Elizabeth firstnameplaceholderson. She was a 24-year-old prostitute from Chelsea whose various body parts were collected from the River Thames over a three-week period between 31 May and 25 June 1889.[112][113]On 29 December 1888, the body of a seven-year-old boy named John Gill was found in a stable block in Manningham, Bradford.[114] Gill had been missing since 27 December. His legs had been severed, his abdomen opened, his intestines partly drawn out, and his heart and one ear removed. Similarities with secondnameplaceholder murders led to press speculation that secondnameplaceholder had killed him.[115] The boy's employer, 23-year-old milkman William Barrett, was twice arrested for the murder but was released due to insufficient evidence.[115] No-one was ever prosecuted.[115]Carrie Brown (nicknamed "Shakespeare", reportedly for her habit of quoting Shakespeare's sonnets) was strangled with clothing and then mutilated with a knife on 24 April 1891 in New York City.[116] Her body was found with a large tear through her groin area and superficial cuts on her legs and back. No organs were removed from the scene, though an ovary was found upon the bed, either purposely removed or unintentionally dislodged.[116] At the time, the murder was compared to those in Whitechapel, though the Metropolitan Police eventually ruled out any connection.[116]
<h2>Investigation</h2>
The vast majority of the City of London Police files relating to their investigation into the Whitechapel murders were destroyed in the Blitz.[117] The surviving Metropolitan Police files allow a detailed view of investigative procedures in the Victorian era.[118] A large team of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced, and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Modern police work follows the same pattern.[118] More than 2,000 people were interviewed, "upwards of 300" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.[119] Following the murders of Stride and Eddowes, the Commissioner of the City Police, Sir James Fraser, offered a reward of £500 for the arrest of secondnameplaceholder.[120]The investigation was initially conducted by the Metropolitan Police Whitechapel (H) Division Criminal Investigation Department (CID) headed by Detective Inspector Edmund Reid. After the murder of Nichols, Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline, Henry Moore, and Walter Andrews were sent from Central Office at Scotland Yard to assist. The City of London Police were involved under Detective Inspector James McWilliam after the Eddowes murder, which occurred within the City of London.[121] The overall direction of the murder enquiries was hampered by the fact that the newly appointed head of the CID Robert Anderson was on leave in Switzerland between 7 September and 6 October, during the time when Chapman, Stride, and Eddowes were killed.[122] This prompted Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to coordinate the enquiry from Scotland Yard.[123]Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry.[124] A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months.[125] Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks,[126] and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday.[127] The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.[128]In September 1888, a group of volunteer citizens in London's East End formed the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. They patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, partly because of dissatisfaction with the failure of police to apprehend the perpetrator, and also because some members were concerned that the murders were affecting businesses in the area.[130] The Committee petitioned the government to raise a reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer, offered their own reward of £50 for information leading to his capture,[131] and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.[132]At the end of October, Robert Anderson asked police surgeon Thomas Bond to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge.[133] The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the "Whitechapel murderer" is the earliest surviving offender profile.[134] Bond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the post mortem notes from the four previous canonical murders.[69] He wrote:Bond was strongly opposed to the idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even "the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer".[69] In his opinion, the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating "satyriasis".[69] Bond also stated that "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely".[69]There is no evidence the perpetrator engaged in sexual activity with any of the victims,[17][135] yet psychologists suppose that the penetration of the victims with a knife and "leaving them on display in sexually degrading positions with the wounds exposed" indicates that the perpetrator derived sexual pleasure from the attacks.[17][136] This view is challenged by others, who dismiss such hypotheses as insupportable supposition.[137]In addition to the contradictions and unreliability of contemporary accounts, attempts to identify the murderer are hampered by the lack of any surviving forensic evidence.[138] DNA analysis on extant letters is inconclusive;[139] the available material has been handled many times and is too contaminated to provide meaningful results.[140] There have been mutually incompatible claims that DNA evidence points conclusively to two different suspects, and the methodology of both has also been criticised.[141]

The concentration of the killings around weekends and public holidays and within a short distance of each other has indicated to many that secondnameplaceholder was in regular employment and lived locally.[142] Others have thought that the killer was an educated upper-class man, possibly a doctor or an aristocrat who ventured into Whitechapel from a more well-to-do area.[143] Such theories draw on cultural perceptions such as fear of the medical profession, mistrust of modern science, or the exploitation of the poor by the rich.[144] Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents, as well as many famous names who were never considered in the police investigation, including a member of the British royal family,[145] an artist, and a physician.[146] Everyone alive at the time is now long dead, and modern authors are free to accuse anyone "without any need for any supporting historical evidence".[147] Suspects named in contemporary police documents include three in Sir Melville Macnaghten's 1894 memorandum, but the evidence against these individuals is, at best, circumstantial.[148]There are many, varied theories about the identity and profession of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, but authorities are not agreed upon any of them, and the number of named suspects reaches over one hundred.[149][150] Despite continued interest in the case, secondnameplaceholder's identity remains unknown.[151] The term "ripperology" was coined to describe the study and analysis of secondnameplaceholder cases, and the murders have inspired numerous works of fiction.
<h2>Letters</h2>
Over the course of the Whitechapel murders, the police, newspapers, and other individuals received hundreds of letters regarding the case.[152] Some letters were well-intentioned offers of advice as to how to catch the killer, but the vast majority were either hoaxes or generally useless.[153]Hundreds of letters claimed to have been written by the killer himself,[154] and three of these in particular are prominent: the "Dear Boss" letter, the "Saucy firstnameplaceholdery" postcard and the "From Hell" letter.[155]The "Dear Boss" letter, dated 25 September and postmarked 27 September 1888, was received that day by the Central News Agency, and was forwarded to Scotland Yard on 29 September.[156] Initially, it was considered a hoax, but when Eddowes was found three days after the letter's postmark with a section of one ear obliquely cut from her body, the promise of the author to "clip the ladys (sic) ears off" gained attention.[157] Eddowes's ear appears to have been nicked by the killer incidentally during his attack, and the letter writer's threat to send the ears to the police was never carried out.[158] The name "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" was first used in this letter by the signatory and gained worldwide notoriety after its publication.[159] Most of the letters that followed copied this letter's tone.[160] Some sources claim that another letter dated 17 September 1888 was the first to use the name "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder",[161] but most experts believe that this was a fake inserted into police records in the 20th century.[162]The "Saucy firstnameplaceholdery" postcard was postmarked 1 October 1888 and was received the same day by the Central News Agency. The handwriting was similar to the "Dear Boss" letter,[163] and mentioned the canonical murders committed on 30 September, which the author refers to by writing "double event this time".[164] It has been argued that the postcard was posted before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would hold such knowledge of the crime.[165] However, it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings occurred, long after details of the murders were known and publicised by journalists, and had become general community gossip by the residents of Whitechapel.[164][166]The "From Hell" letter was received by George Lusk, leader of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, on 16 October 1888. The handwriting and style is unlike that of the "Dear Boss" letter and "Saucy firstnameplaceholdery" postcard.[167] The letter came with a small box in which Lusk discovered half of a human kidney, preserved in "spirits of wine" (ethanol).[167] Eddowes's left kidney had been removed by the killer. The writer claimed that he "fried and ate" the missing kidney half. There is disagreement over the kidney; some contend that it belonged to Eddowes, while others argue that it was a macabre practical joke.[168][169] The kidney was examined by Dr Thomas Openshaw of the London Hospital, who determined that it was human and from the left side, but (contrary to false newspaper reports) he could not determine any other biological characteristics.[170] Openshaw subsequently also received a letter signed "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder".[171]Scotland Yard published facsimiles of the "Dear Boss" letter and the postcard on 3 October, in the ultimately vain hope that a member of the public would recognise the handwriting.[172] Charles Warren explained in a letter to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department: "I think the whole thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try & ascertain the writer in any case."[173] On 7 October 1888, George R. Sims in the Sunday newspaper Referee implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist "to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high".[174] Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the "Dear Boss" letter and the postcard.[175] The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector John Littlechild to George R. Sims dated 23 September 1913.[176] A journalist named Fred Best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he and a colleague at The Star had written the letters signed "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" to heighten interest in the murders and "keep the business alive".[177]
<h2>Media</h2>
The Ripper murders mark an important watershed in the treatment of crime by journalists.[23][178] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy.[23][178] The Elementary Education Act 1880 (which had extended upon a previous Act) made school attendance compulsory regardless of class. As such, by 1888, more working-class people in England and Wales were literate.[179]Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with a wider circulation.[180] These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers costing as little as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made secondnameplaceholder the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.[181] Consequently, at the height of the investigation, over one million copies[182] of newspapers with extensive coverage devoted to the Whitechapel murders were sold each day.[183] However, many of the articles were sensationalistic and speculative, and false information was regularly printed as fact.[184] In addition, several articles speculating as to the identity of secondnameplaceholder alluded to local xenophobic rumours that the perpetrator was either Jewish or foreign.[185][186]In early September, six days after the murder of Mary Ann Nichols, The Manchester Guardian reported: "Whatever information may be in the possession of the police they deem it necessary to keep secret ... It is believed their attention is particularly directed to ... a notorious character known as 'Leather Apron'."[187] Journalists were frustrated by the unwillingness of the CID to reveal details of their investigation to the public, and so resorted to writing reports of questionable veracity.[23][188] Imaginative descriptions of "Leather Apron" appeared in the press,[189] but rival journalists dismissed these as "a mythical outgrowth of the reporter's fancy".[190] John Pizer, a local Jew who made footwear from leather, was known by the name "Leather Apron"[191] and was arrested, even though the investigating inspector reported that "at present there is no evidence whatsoever against him".[192] He was soon released after the confirmation of his alibis.[191]After the publication of the "Dear Boss" letter, "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" supplanted "Leather Apron" as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer.[193] The name "firstnameplaceholder" was already used to describe another fabled London attacker: "Spring-heeled firstnameplaceholder", who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape as quickly as he came.[194] The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the Axeman of New Orleans, the Boston Strangler, and the Beltway Sniper. Examples derived from firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder include the French Ripper, the Düsseldorf Ripper, the Camden Ripper, the Blackout Ripper, firstnameplaceholder the Stripper, the Yorkshire Ripper, and the Rostov Ripper. Sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers.[195]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
The nature of secondnameplaceholder murders and the impoverished lifestyle of the victims[196] drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End[197] and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, insanitary slums.[198] In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished,[199] but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of secondnameplaceholder is still promoted by various guided tours of the murder sites and other locations pertaining to the case.[200] For many years, the Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street (which had been frequented by at least one of the canonical Ripper victims) was the focus of such tours.[201]In the immediate aftermath of the murders and later, "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder became the children's bogey man."[202] Depictions were often phantasmic or monstrous. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was depicted in film dressed in everyday clothes as a man with a hidden secret, preying on his unsuspecting victims; atmosphere and evil were suggested through lighting effects and shadowplay.[203] By the 1960s, secondnameplaceholder had become "the symbol of a predatory aristocracy",[203] and was more often portrayed in a top hat dressed as a gentleman. The Establishment as a whole became the villain, with secondnameplaceholder acting as a manifestation of upper-class exploitation.[204] The image of secondnameplaceholder merged with or borrowed symbols from horror stories, such as Dracula's cloak or Victor Frankenstein's organ harvest.[205] The fictional world of secondnameplaceholder can fuse with multiple genres, ranging from Sherlock Holmes to Japanese erotic horror.[206]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder features in hundreds of works of fiction and works which straddle the boundaries between fact and fiction, including secondnameplaceholder letters and a hoax diary: The Diary of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[207] The Ripper appears in novels, short stories, poems, comic books, games, songs, plays, operas, television programmes, and films. More than 100 non-fiction works deal exclusively with the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder murders, making it one of the most written-about true-crime subjects.[149] The term "ripperology" was coined by Colin Wilson in the 1970s to describe the study of the case by professionals and amateurs.[208][209] The periodicals Ripperana, Ripperologist, and Ripper Notes publish their research.[210]In 2015, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Museum opened in east London, to minor protests.[211] There is no waxwork figure of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder at Madame Tussauds' Chamber of Horrors, unlike numerous murderers of lesser fame, in accordance with their policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown.[212] He is instead depicted as a shadow.[213] In 2006, a BBC History magazine poll selected firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder as the worst Briton in history.[214][215]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder Lionel secondnameplaceholder (/ˈdɑːmər/; May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994), also known as the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster, was a convicted American serial killer and sex offender who committed the murder and dismemberment of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. Many of his later murders involved necrophilia,[1] cannibalism, and the permanent preservation of body parts—typically all or part of the skeleton.[2]Although he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,[3] schizotypal personality disorder,[4] and a psychotic disorder, secondnameplaceholder was found to be legally sane at his trial. He was convicted of 15 of the 16 murders he had committed in Wisconsin, and was sentenced to 15 terms of life imprisonment on February 17, 1992.[5] secondnameplaceholder was later sentenced to a 16th term of life imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in Ohio in 1978.On November 28, 1994, secondnameplaceholder was beaten to death by Christopher Scarver, a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born May 21, 1960, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,[6] the first of two sons of Joyce Annette (née Flint), a teletype machine instructor,[5] and Lionel Herbert secondnameplaceholder, a Marquette University chemistry student. Lionel secondnameplaceholder was of German and Welsh ancestry,[7] and Joyce secondnameplaceholder was of Norwegian and Irish ancestry.[8]It has been claimed that secondnameplaceholder was deprived of attention as an infant.[9] Other sources, however, suggest that secondnameplaceholder was generally doted upon as an infant and toddler by both parents, although his mother was known to be tense, greedy for both attention and pity, and argumentative with her husband and their neighbors.[10]As secondnameplaceholder entered first grade, Joyce began to spend an increasing amount of time in bed recovering from weakness. Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife—a hypochondriac who suffered from depression—demanded constant attention.[11] She reportedly worked herself into a state of anxiety over trivial matters simply to earn appeasement from her husband. On one occasion, she is known to have attempted suicide with Equanil.[11] Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son, who later recollected that, from an early age, he felt "unsure of the solidity of the family",[12] recalling extreme tension and numerous arguments between his parents during his early years.[13]secondnameplaceholder had been an "energetic and happy child" but became notably subdued after double hernia surgery shortly before his fourth birthday.[14][15] At elementary school, secondnameplaceholder was regarded as quiet and timid; one teacher later recollected she detected early signs of abandonment[16] in secondnameplaceholder due to his mother's illnesses, the symptoms of which increased when she became pregnant with her second child.[17] Nonetheless, in grade school, secondnameplaceholder did have a small number of friends.[18]From an early age, secondnameplaceholder manifested an interest in dead animals. He initially collected large insects, such as dragonflies and butterflies, in jars. Later he collected animal carcasses, occasionally accompanied by one or more friends; he dismembered these animals either at home or in nearby woodland. According to one friend, secondnameplaceholder dismembered these animals and stored the parts in jars in the family's toolshed, explaining that he was curious as to how animals "fitted together".[19] His fascination with dead animals may have begun when, at the age of four, he saw his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel, secondnameplaceholder was "oddly thrilled" by the sound the bones made, and became preoccupied with animal bones. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones, and explored the bodies of live animals to discover where their bones were located.[11] In one instance, secondnameplaceholder decapitated the carcass of a dog before nailing the body to a tree and impaling the skull[20] on a stake beside a wooden cross in the woodland behind his house.[21][22]In October 1966, the family moved to Doylestown, Ohio.[23] When Joyce gave birth in December, firstnameplaceholder was allowed to choose the name of his new baby brother; he chose the name David.[24] The same year, Lionel earned his degree and started work as an analytical chemist in nearby Akron, Ohio.[25]In 1968, the family moved to Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio. Two years later, during a chicken dinner, secondnameplaceholder asked Lionel what would happen if the chicken bones were placed in bleach.[26] Lionel, pleased by secondnameplaceholder's curiosity, demonstrated how to safely bleach and preserve animal bones. secondnameplaceholder incorporated these preserving techniques into his bone collecting.[27] The same year, Joyce began increasing her daily consumption of Equanil, laxatives, and sleeping pills, further minimizing her tangible contact with her husband and children.[26]From his freshman year at Revere High School, secondnameplaceholder was seen as an outcast.[n 1] By the age of 14, he had begun drinking beer and hard alcohol in daylight hours;[28] frequently concealing his liquor inside the lining of the army fatigue jacket he wore to school.[29] He is known to have mentioned to one classmate who inquired why he was drinking Scotch in a morning history class that the alcohol he consumed was "[my] medicine".[30][31] Although largely uncommunicative, in his freshman year, secondnameplaceholder was seen by staff as polite and highly intelligent but with average grades.[32] He was a keen tennis player and played briefly in the high school band.[33]When he reached puberty, secondnameplaceholder discovered he was gay;[34] he did not tell his parents. In his early teens, he had a brief relationship with another teenage boy, although they never had intercourse.[35] By secondnameplaceholder's later admission, he began fantasizing about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner in his early- to mid-teens, and his masturbatory fantasies gradually evolved to his focusing upon the chests and torsos of the focus of his fantasies. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with dissection.[36] When he was about 16, secondnameplaceholder conceived a fantasy of rendering unconscious a particular male jogger he found attractive, and then making sexual use of his body. On one occasion secondnameplaceholder concealed himself in bushes with a baseball bat to lay in wait for this man; however, he did not pass by on that particular day.[36] secondnameplaceholder later said this was his first attempt to attack someone.Despite being regarded as a loner and an oddball among his peers at RHS, secondnameplaceholder became something of a class clown who often staged pranks,[37] which became known as "Doing a secondnameplaceholder"; these included bleating and simulating epileptic seizures or cerebral palsy,[38] at school and local stores.[39]By 1977, secondnameplaceholder's grades had declined;[40] his parents hired a private tutor, with limited success. The same year, in an attempt to save their marriage, his parents attended counseling sessions. They continued to quarrel frequently. When Lionel discovered Joyce had engaged in a brief affair in September 1977, they both decided to divorce, telling their sons they wished to do so amicably. Lionel moved out of the house in early 1978, temporarily residing in a motel on North Cleveland Massillon Road.[41][42]In May 1978, secondnameplaceholder graduated from high school. A few weeks before his graduation, one of his teachers observed secondnameplaceholder sitting close to the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer.[43] When the teacher threatened to report the matter, secondnameplaceholder informed him he was experiencing "a lot of problems" at home and that the school's guidance counselor was aware of them. That spring, Joyce and David moved out of the family home to live with relatives in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.[44][45] secondnameplaceholder had just turned 18 and remained in the family home.[46] secondnameplaceholder's parents' divorce was finalized on July 24, 1978. Joyce was awarded custody of her younger son and alimony payments.[47]
<h2>Late teens and early 20s: first murder</h2>
secondnameplaceholder committed his first murder in 1978, three weeks after his graduation. At the time he was living alone in the family home in Bath. On June 18,[48] secondnameplaceholder picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks, who was almost 19.[49][50] secondnameplaceholder lured the youth to his house on the pretext of the two young men drinking alcohol together. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert at Chippewa Lake Park, Ohio, agreed to accompany secondnameplaceholder to his house upon the promise of "a few beers" with secondnameplaceholder as he had the house to himself.[49]According to secondnameplaceholder, the sight of the bare-chested Hicks standing at the roadside stirred his sexual feelings, although when Hicks began talking about girls, he knew any sexual passes he made would be rebuffed.[51] After several hours of talking, drinking and listening to music, Hicks "wanted to leave and [I] didn't want him to."[52]In response, secondnameplaceholder bludgeoned Hicks with a 10 lb. dumbbell. He later stated he struck Hicks twice from behind[53] with the dumbbell as Hicks sat upon a chair. When Hicks fell unconscious, secondnameplaceholder strangled him to death with the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks' body before exploring his chest with his hands, then masturbating as he stood above the corpse.[53] The following day,[54] secondnameplaceholder dissected Hicks' body in his basement; he later buried the remains in a shallow grave in his backyard[55] before, several weeks later, unearthing the remains and paring the flesh from the bones.[56] He dissolved the flesh in acid before flushing the solution down the toilet; he crushed the bones with a sledgehammer and scattered them in the woodland behind the family home.[57]Six weeks after the murder of Hicks, secondnameplaceholder's father and his fiancée returned to his home, where they discovered firstnameplaceholder living alone at the house. That August, secondnameplaceholder enrolled at Ohio State University (OSU), hoping to major in business.[58] secondnameplaceholder's sole term at OSU was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse throughout the majority of the term. He received failing grades in Introduction to Anthropology, Classical Civilizations, and Administrative Science. The only course secondnameplaceholder was successful at was Riflery, having received a B- grade. His overall GPA was 0.45/4.0.[59][60] On one occasion, Lionel paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his room strewn with empty liquor bottles. Despite his father having paid in advance for the second term, secondnameplaceholder dropped out of OSU after just three months.[61]In January 1979,[62] on his father's urging, secondnameplaceholder enlisted in the United States Army,[63] where he trained as a medical specialist at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. On July 13, 1979, he was deployed to Baumholder, West Germany, where he served as a combat medic in 2nd Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment, 8th Infantry Division.[31][64] According to published reports, in secondnameplaceholder's first year of service, he was an "average or slightly above average" soldier.[65][66][n 2]Owing to secondnameplaceholder's alcohol abuse, his performance deteriorated and, in March 1981, he was deemed unsuitable for military service and was later discharged from the Army.[70] He received an honorable discharge, as his superiors did not believe that any problems secondnameplaceholder had in the Army would be applicable to civilian life.[71]On March 24, 1981, secondnameplaceholder was sent to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, for debriefing and provided with a plane ticket to travel anywhere in the country. secondnameplaceholder later told police he felt he could not return home to face his father, so he opted to travel to Miami Beach, Florida, both because he was "tired of the cold"[72] and in an attempt to live by his own means. In Florida, secondnameplaceholder found employment at a delicatessen and rented a room in a nearby motel. secondnameplaceholder spent most of his salary on alcohol, and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. He initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.[73]After his return to Ohio, secondnameplaceholder initially resided with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. He continued to drink heavily, and two weeks after his return secondnameplaceholder was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct,[74] for which he was fined $60 and given a suspended 10-day jail sentence.[75] secondnameplaceholder's father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, he and secondnameplaceholder's stepmother sent him to live with his grandmother in West Allis, Wisconsin. secondnameplaceholder's grandmother was the only family member to whom he displayed any affection.[76] They hoped that her influence, plus the change of scenery, might persuade secondnameplaceholder to refrain from alcohol, find a job, and live responsibly.[77][78]Initially, secondnameplaceholder's living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church; willingly undertook chores; actively sought work; and abided by most of her house rules (although he did continue to drink and smoke).[79] This new influence in his life initially brought results and, in early 1982, secondnameplaceholder found employment as a phlebotomist at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of 10 months before being laid off.[76] secondnameplaceholder remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.[80]Shortly before losing his job, secondnameplaceholder was arrested for indecent exposure. On August 7, 1982, at Wisconsin State Fair Park, he was observed to expose himself "on the south side of the Coliseum in which 25 people were present including women and children." For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus court costs.[81]In January 1985, secondnameplaceholder was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after secondnameplaceholder found this employment, an incident occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw secondnameplaceholder a note offering to perform fellatio upon him. Although secondnameplaceholder did not respond to this proposition,[82] the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's gay bars, gay bathhouses and bookstores. He is also known to have stolen a male mannequin from a store,[83] which he briefly used for sexual stimulation, until his grandmother discovered the item stowed in a closet and demanded that he discard it.[84]By late 1985, secondnameplaceholder had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being "relaxing places",[85] but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners' moving during the sexual act. Following his arrest, he stated: "I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people".[85] For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered sleeping pills to his partners, giving them liquor laced with the sedatives. He then waited for his partner to fall asleep before performing various sexual acts.[86] To maintain an adequate supply of this medication, secondnameplaceholder informed doctors he worked nights and required the tablets to adjust his body to work unsociable hours.[87] After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses' administration revoked secondnameplaceholder's membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.[88]Shortly after his membership of the bathhouses was revoked,[89] secondnameplaceholder read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male. He conceived the idea of stealing the freshly interred corpse and taking it home.[90] According to secondnameplaceholder, he attempted to dig up the coffin from the ground, but found the soil too hard and abandoned the plan.[91]In August 1986,[92] secondnameplaceholder was arrested for masturbating in the presence of two 12-year-old boys as he stood close to the Kinnickinnic River.[93][94] He initially admitted the offense and was again charged with indecent exposure, but quickly changed his story and claimed he had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses. The charge was changed to disorderly conduct and, on March 10, 1987, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to one year of probation, with additional instructions he was to undergo counseling.[95]
<h2>Late 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders</h2>
On November 20, 1987, secondnameplaceholder—at the time residing with his grandmother in West Allis—encountered a 25-year-old man from Ontonagon, Michigan, Steven Tuomi, at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, where secondnameplaceholder had rented a room for the evening. According to secondnameplaceholder, he had no intention of murdering Tuomi, but rather intended to simply drug him and lie beside him as he explored his body. The following morning, however, secondnameplaceholder awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest "crushed in" and "black and blue" with bruises. Blood was also seeping from the corner of his mouth, and secondnameplaceholder's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. secondnameplaceholder stated he had no memory of having killed Tuomi,[93][94][96] and later informed investigators that he "could not believe this had happened."To dispose of Tuomi's body, secondnameplaceholder purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later,[97] he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso,[94] then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. secondnameplaceholder then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags.[97] He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into splinters with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took secondnameplaceholder approximately two hours to complete, and he disposed of all of Tuomi's remains—excluding the severed head[98]—in the trash.[99]For a total of two weeks following Tuomi's murder, secondnameplaceholder retained the victim's head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, secondnameplaceholder boiled the head in a mixture of Soilex (an alkali-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching process, so secondnameplaceholder pulverized and disposed of it.[98]Following the murder of Tuomi, secondnameplaceholder began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he typically lured to his grandmother's home. He would drug his victim with triazolam or temazepam before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered his victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by strangulation.[100][101]Two months after the Tuomi killing, secondnameplaceholder encountered a 14-year-old Native American male prostitute named James Doxtator; secondnameplaceholder lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At secondnameplaceholder's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before secondnameplaceholder drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar.[102] secondnameplaceholder left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. The skull was boiled and cleansed in bleach before secondnameplaceholder noted it had been rendered too brittle by this process. He pulverized the skull two weeks later.[103]On March 24, 1988, secondnameplaceholder met a 22-year-old bisexual man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix.[103] secondnameplaceholder lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him;[104] he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with secondnameplaceholder then performing oral sex upon the corpse.[104] Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24 hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.[105]On April 23, secondnameplaceholder lured another young man to his house; however, after giving the victim a drugged coffee, both he and the intended victim heard secondnameplaceholder's grandmother call, "Is that you, Jeff?"[106] Although secondnameplaceholder replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, she did observe that secondnameplaceholder was not alone. Because of this, secondnameplaceholder opted not to kill this particular victim, instead waiting until he had become unconscious before taking him to the County General Hospital.[107]In September 1988, secondnameplaceholder's grandmother asked him to move out because of his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night and the foul smells emanating from both the basement and the garage. secondnameplaceholder found a one-bedroom apartment on North 25th Street and moved into his new residence on September 25.[108] The following day, he was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.[109] secondnameplaceholder's father hired an attorney named Gerald Boyle to defend his son. At Boyle's request, secondnameplaceholder underwent a series of psychological evaluations prior to his upcoming court hearings. These evaluations revealed secondnameplaceholder harbored deep feelings of alienation. A second evaluation two months later revealed secondnameplaceholder to be an impulsive individual, suspicious of others, and dismayed by his lack of accomplishments in life. His probation officer would also reference a 1987 diagnosis of secondnameplaceholder suffering from a schizoid personality disorder for presentation to the court.[110]In January 1989, secondnameplaceholder was convicted of second-degree sexual assault and of enticing a child for immoral purposes.[111] Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May 1989.[112] On March 20,[113] secondnameplaceholder commenced a 10-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.Two months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing for the sexual assault, secondnameplaceholder murdered his fifth victim. He was a mixed-race 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom secondnameplaceholder met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to secondnameplaceholder, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before closing time that evening, Sears "just started talking to me". secondnameplaceholder lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before secondnameplaceholder drugged and strangled Sears.[1]The following morning, secondnameplaceholder placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to flay the corpse.[1] He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which were again disposed of in the trash. According to secondnameplaceholder, he found Sears "exceptionally attractive", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in acetone[114] and stored them in a wooden box, which he later placed in his work locker.[n 3] When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.[116]On May 23, 1989,[112] secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with work release permitted in order that he be able to keep his job; he was also required to register as a sex offender.[117]Two months before his scheduled release from the work camp, secondnameplaceholder was paroled from this regime. His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point.[118] On release, secondnameplaceholder temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis[119] before, in May 1990, moving into the Oxford Apartments, located on North 25th Street in Milwaukee. Although located in a high-crime area, the apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished and, at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical.[120]On May 14, 1990, secondnameplaceholder moved out of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Sears' mummified head and genitals with him.[120][n 4] Within one week of his moving into his new apartment, secondnameplaceholder had killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom secondnameplaceholder lured to Apartment 213 with the promise of $50 for sex.[122] Inside the apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills, then manually strangled him.[123]The following day, secondnameplaceholder purchased a Polaroid camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which allowed him to then rinse the bones in his sink.[123] secondnameplaceholder dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton—excluding the skull—in a container filled with acid. He later spray-painted Smith's skull, which he placed alongside the skull of Sears upon a black towel inside a metal filing-cabinet.[124]Approximately one week after the murder of Smith, on or about May 27, secondnameplaceholder lured another young man to his apartment. On this occasion, however, secondnameplaceholder himself accidentally consumed the drink laden with sedatives intended for consumption by his guest. When he awoke the following day, he discovered his intended victim had stolen several items of his clothing, $300, and a watch.[125] secondnameplaceholder never reported this incident to the police, although on May 29, he divulged to his probation officer that he had been robbed.[126]In June 1990, secondnameplaceholder lured a 27-year-old acquaintance named Edward Smith to his apartment. He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), secondnameplaceholder placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim would be acidified several months later. secondnameplaceholder accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry—a process that caused the skull to explode. secondnameplaceholder himself was to later inform police he had felt "rotten" about Smith's murder as he had been unable to retain any parts of his body.[127]Less than three months after the murder of Smith, secondnameplaceholder encountered a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller outside a bookstore on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany secondnameplaceholder to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When secondnameplaceholder attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed, "That'll cost you extra,"[129] whereupon secondnameplaceholder gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills.On this occasion, secondnameplaceholder had only two sleeping pills to give his victim. Therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes.[130] secondnameplaceholder then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. secondnameplaceholder repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.[130]secondnameplaceholder wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption.[131] He boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a "jelly-like substance" using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, secondnameplaceholder placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24 hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.[132]Three weeks after the murder of Miller, on September 24, secondnameplaceholder encountered a 22-year-old man named David Thomas at the Grand Avenue Mall and persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, secondnameplaceholder stated that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. He photographed the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas's subsequent identification.[133]Following the murder of Thomas, secondnameplaceholder did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment.[129] He is also known to have regularly complained of feelings of both anxiety and depression to his probation officer throughout 1990; with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, and financial difficulties. On several occasions, secondnameplaceholder is also known to have referred to harboring suicidal thoughts.[134]In February 1991, secondnameplaceholder observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near Marquette University. According to secondnameplaceholder, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos,[135] with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. secondnameplaceholder drugged Straughter, cuffed his hands behind his back, then strangled him to death with a leather strap. He then dismembered Straughter, retaining the youth's skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process.[136]Less than two months later, on April 7, secondnameplaceholder encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey[137][138] walking to get a key cut. Lindsey was heterosexual. secondnameplaceholder lured Lindsey to his apartment, where he drugged him, drilled a hole in his skull and poured hydrochloric acid into it. According to secondnameplaceholder, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which secondnameplaceholder had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: "I have a headache. What time is it?"[139][140] In response to this, secondnameplaceholder again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull; he then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, he disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.[141]By 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the building's manager, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw.[142] Princewill did contact secondnameplaceholder in response to these complaints on several occasions, although he initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become "spoiled". On later occasions, he informed Princewill that the reason for the resurgence of the odor was that several of his tropical fish had recently died, and that he would take care of the matter.[143]On the afternoon of May 26, 1991, secondnameplaceholder encountered a 14-year-old Lao teenager named Konerak Sinthasomphone on Wisconsin Avenue. By coincidence, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy whom secondnameplaceholder had molested in 1988.[144] He approached the youth with an offer of money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to secondnameplaceholder, Sinthasomphone was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying secondnameplaceholder to his apartment, where the youth posed for two pictures in his underwear before secondnameplaceholder drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him.[145]On this occasion, secondnameplaceholder drilled a single hole into Sinthasomphone's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the frontal lobe.[145] Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, secondnameplaceholder led the boy into his bedroom, where the body of 31-year-old Tony Hughes, whom secondnameplaceholder had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor.[146] According to secondnameplaceholder, he "believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body", yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse—likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested and the hydrochloric acid secondnameplaceholder had injected through his skull. Sinthasomphone soon became unconscious, whereupon secondnameplaceholder drank several beers while lying alongside him before leaving his apartment to drink at a bar, then purchase more alcohol.[147]In the early morning hours of May 27, secondnameplaceholder returned toward his apartment to discover Sinthasomphone sitting naked on the corner of 25th and State, talking in Lao, with three distressed young women standing near him.[148][149] secondnameplaceholder approached the women and told them that Sinthasomphone (whom he referred to by the alias John Hmong)[150][151] was his friend, and attempted to lead him to his apartment by the arm. The three women dissuaded secondnameplaceholder, explaining they had phoned 9-1-1.[152]Upon the arrival of three Milwaukee police officers, John Balcerzak, Joseph Gabrish and Richard Porubcan,[153] secondnameplaceholder's demeanor relaxed: he told the officers that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, that he had drunk too much following a quarrel,[154] and that he frequently behaved in this manner when intoxicated, adding his lover had consumed Jack Daniel's whiskey that evening. The three women were exasperated, and when one of the trio attempted to indicate to one of the officers that Sinthasomphone had blood upon his testicles, was bleeding from his rectum and that he had seemingly struggled against secondnameplaceholder's attempts to walk him to his apartment prior to their arrival,[n 5] the officer harshly informed her to "butt out",[156] "shut the hell up" and to not interfere.[157][158]Against the protests of the three women, the three officers simply covered Sinthasomphone with a towel and walked him to secondnameplaceholder's apartment where,[159] in an effort to verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, secondnameplaceholder showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of the youth the previous evening. Though Balcerzak said he smelled nothing unusual, Gabrish later stated he noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment.[160] This odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes.[161][162] secondnameplaceholder stated that to investigate this odor, one officer simply "peeked his head around the bedroom but really didn't take a good look." The officers then left, with a departing remark that secondnameplaceholder "take good care" of Sinthasomphone.[163] This incident was listed by the officers as a "domestic dispute."[156][n 6]Upon the departure of the three officers from his apartment, secondnameplaceholder again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain. On this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, secondnameplaceholder took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes. He retained both victims' skulls.[165][n 7]On June 30, secondnameplaceholder traveled to Chicago, where he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner at a bus station.[167] Turner accepted secondnameplaceholder's offer to travel to Milwaukee for a professional photo shoot. At the apartment, secondnameplaceholder drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported missing. Five days later, on July 5, secondnameplaceholder lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a coma from which he died two days later.[168][n 8]On July 15, secondnameplaceholder encountered 24-year-old[170] Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn.[171] Lacy agreed to secondnameplaceholder's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before secondnameplaceholder drugged Lacy. On this occasion, secondnameplaceholder intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive. After unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with chloroform,[172] he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended.[170]After strangling Lacy, secondnameplaceholder had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer.[170] Four days later, on July 19, secondnameplaceholder received word that he was fired.[173] Upon receipt of this news, secondnameplaceholder lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on secondnameplaceholder's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, secondnameplaceholder removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator.[174] He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.[175][176]
<h2>Arrest</h2>
On July 22, 1991, secondnameplaceholder approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs,[177] drink beer and simply keep him company.[178] One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering secondnameplaceholder's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which secondnameplaceholder claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to secondnameplaceholder's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon secondnameplaceholder placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, "What's happening?" secondnameplaceholder unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together,[179] then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters on the wall and that a videotape of The Exorcist III was playing;[178][180] he also noted a blue 57-gallon drum in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.[181]secondnameplaceholder then brandished a knife and informed Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease secondnameplaceholder, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, secondnameplaceholder simply turned his attention towards the TV. Edwards observed secondnameplaceholder rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him. He placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.[182]In continuous attempts to prevent secondnameplaceholder from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was secondnameplaceholder's friend and that he was not going to run away.[183] Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity. When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning. secondnameplaceholder consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed secondnameplaceholder have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again.[184] When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted secondnameplaceholder was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking secondnameplaceholder off balance, and ran out the front door.[185]At 11:30 p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers, Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller, at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist,[186][187] whereupon he explained to the officers that a "freak" had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.[186]When the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, secondnameplaceholder invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that secondnameplaceholder had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. secondnameplaceholder made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser. As Mueller entered the bedroom, secondnameplaceholder attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Rauth, informed him to "back off".[188]In the bedroom, Mueller noted there was indeed a large knife beneath the bed. He also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. Mueller walked into the living room to show them to his partner,[189] uttering the words, "These are for real."[188]When secondnameplaceholder saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf.[190] As secondnameplaceholder lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: "For what I did I should be dead."[191]A more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Milwaukee police's Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in secondnameplaceholder's kitchen. A total of seven skulls—some painted, some bleached—were found in secondnameplaceholder's bedroom and inside a closet.[192] In addition, investigators discovered collected blood drippings upon a tray at the bottom of secondnameplaceholder's refrigerator, plus two human hearts[193] and a portion of arm muscle, each wrapped inside plastic bags upon the shelves. In secondnameplaceholder's freezer, investigators discovered an entire torso, plus a bag of human organs and flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom.[194]Elsewhere in Apartment 213, investigators discovered two entire skeletons, a pair of severed hands, two severed and preserved penises, a mummified scalp and, in the 57-gallon drum, three further dismembered torsos dissolving in the acid solution. A total of 74 Polaroid pictures detailing the dismemberment of secondnameplaceholder's victims were found.[196] In reference to the recovery of body parts and artifacts at 924 North 25th Street, the chief medical examiner later stated: "It was more like dismantling someone's museum than an actual crime scene."[197]Beginning in the early hours of July 23, 1991, secondnameplaceholder was questioned by Detective Patrick Kennedy as to the murders he had committed and the evidence found at his apartment. Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Dennis Murphy conducted numerous interviews with secondnameplaceholder which, when combined, totalled over 60 hours.[198][199] secondnameplaceholder waived his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations,[200] adding he wished to confess all as he had "created this horror and it only makes sense I do everything to put an end to it."[201] He readily admitted to having murdered 16 young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim—Steven Hicks—killed in Ohio back in 1978.Most of secondnameplaceholder's victims had been rendered unconscious prior to their murder, although some had died as a result of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest.[202] Almost all the murders secondnameplaceholder committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions—typically with the chest thrust outwards—prior to dismemberment.[203]secondnameplaceholder readily admitted to engaging in necrophilia with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their viscera[203] as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, secondnameplaceholder first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before dicing any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body.[204] The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, secondnameplaceholder confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.[205]Describing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, secondnameplaceholder stated he had been "completely swept along"[206] with his compulsion to kill, adding: "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long."[207] When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, secondnameplaceholder stated he had been in the process of constructing a private altar of victims' skulls which he had intended to display on the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims.[208]This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Miller and Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which secondnameplaceholder intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights.[208] The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which secondnameplaceholder intended to sit in a black leather chair.[208]When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview whom the altar was dedicated to, secondnameplaceholder replied: "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." He further described his intended altar as a "place for meditation," from where he believed he could draw a sense of power,[208] adding: "If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found."[208]On July 25, 1991, secondnameplaceholder was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. By August 22, he had been charged with a further 11 murders committed in Wisconsin.[201] On September 14, investigators in Ohio, having uncovered hundreds of bone fragments in woodland behind the address in which secondnameplaceholder had confessed to killing his first victim, formally identified two molars and a vertebra with X-ray records of Hicks.[209] Three days later, secondnameplaceholder was charged by authorities in Ohio with Hicks's murder.[210]secondnameplaceholder was not charged with the attempted murder of Edwards,[201] nor with the murder of Tuomi.[211] He was not charged with Tuomi's murder because the Milwaukee County District Attorney only brought charges where murder could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt[212] and secondnameplaceholder had no memory of actually committing this particular murder, for which no physical evidence of the crime existed.[212] At a scheduled preliminary hearing on January 13, 1992,[213] secondnameplaceholder pleaded guilty but insane to 15 counts of murder.[214]
<h2>Trial</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's trial began on January 30, 1992.[215] He was tried in Milwaukee for the 15 counts of first-degree murder[216] before Judge Laurence Gram.[217] By pleading guilty on January 13 to the charges brought against him, secondnameplaceholder had waived his rights to an initial trial to establish guilt (as defined in Wisconsin law).[218] The issue debated by opposing counsels at secondnameplaceholder's trial was to determine whether he suffered from either a mental or a personality disorder:[218] the prosecution claiming that any disorders did not deprive secondnameplaceholder of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to deprive him of the ability to resist his impulses; the defense arguing that secondnameplaceholder suffered from a mental disease[219] and was driven by obsessions and impulses he was unable to control.[220]Defense experts argued that secondnameplaceholder was insane due to his necrophilic drive – his compulsion to have sexual encounters with corpses. Defense expert Dr. Fred Berlin testified that secondnameplaceholder was unable to conform his conduct at the time that he committed the crimes because he was suffering from paraphilia or, more specifically, necrophilia. Dr. Judith Becker, a professor of psychiatry and psychology, was the second expert witness for the defense; Becker also diagnosed secondnameplaceholder as a necrophiliac, although she added secondnameplaceholder had informed her he preferred comatose sexual partners to deceased ones "75 percent" of the time.[221] The final defense expert to testify, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carl Wahlstrom, diagnosed secondnameplaceholder with necrophilia, borderline personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, alcohol dependence, and a psychotic disorder.[3][222][223]The prosecution rejected the defense's argument that secondnameplaceholder was insane. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick testified that secondnameplaceholder did not suffer from primary necrophilia because he preferred live sexual partners as evidenced by his efforts to create unresistant, submissive sexual partners devoid of rational thought and to whose needs he did not have to cater.[224] Another prosecution expert to testify, Dr. Fred Fosdel, testified to his belief that secondnameplaceholder was without mental disease or defect at the time he committed the murders. He described secondnameplaceholder as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate between right and wrong, with the ability to control his actions.[225] Although Fosdel did state his belief that secondnameplaceholder suffered from paraphilia, his conclusion was that secondnameplaceholder was not a sadist.[226]The final witness to appear for the prosecution, forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, began his testimony on February 12. Dietz testified that he did not believe secondnameplaceholder to be suffering from any mental disease or defect at the time that he committed the crimes, stating: "secondnameplaceholder went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses."[227] He explained that there was ample evidence that secondnameplaceholder prepared in advance for each murder, therefore, his crimes were not impulsive.[228][229] Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice,[227] he also stated his belief that secondnameplaceholder's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant, stating: "If he had an impulse to kill or a compulsion to kill, he wouldn't have to drink alcohol to overcome it. He only has to drink alcohol to overcome it because he is inhibited against killing."[230]Dietz also noted that secondnameplaceholder strongly identified with evil and corrupt characters from both The Exorcist III and Return of the Jedi; particularly the level of power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on secondnameplaceholder's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that secondnameplaceholder occasionally viewed scenes from these films before searching for a victim.[231] Dietz diagnosed secondnameplaceholder with substance use disorder, paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.[232]Two court-appointed mental health professionals—testifying independently of either prosecution or defense—were forensic psychiatrist George Palermo and clinical psychologist Samuel Friedman. Palermo stated that the murders were the result of a "pent-up aggression within himself [secondnameplaceholder]. He killed those men because he wanted to kill the source of his homosexual attraction to them. In killing them, he killed what he hated in himself." Palermo concluded that secondnameplaceholder was a sexual sadist with antisocial personality disorder, but legally sane.[233]Friedman testified that it was a longing for companionship that caused secondnameplaceholder to kill. He stated, "Mr. secondnameplaceholder is not psychotic." He spoke kindly of secondnameplaceholder, describing him as, "Amiable, pleasant to be with, courteous, with a sense of humor, conventionally handsome, and charming in manner. He was, and still is, a bright young man."[2][90][234] He diagnosed secondnameplaceholder with a personality disorder not otherwise specified featuring borderline, obsessive-compulsive, and sadistic traits.[235]The trial lasted two weeks.[138] On February 14, both counsels delivered their closing arguments to the jury. Each counsel was allowed to speak for two hours. Defense attorney Gerald Boyle argued first. Repeatedly harking to the testimony of the mental health professionals—almost all of whom had agreed secondnameplaceholder was suffering from a mental disease[236]—Boyle argued that secondnameplaceholder's compulsive killings had been a result of "a sickness he discovered, not chose."[237][238] Boyle portrayed secondnameplaceholder as a desperately lonely and profoundly sick individual "so out of control he could not conform his conduct any more."[239]Following the defense counsel's 75-minute closing argument, Michael McCann delivered his closing argument for the prosecution, describing secondnameplaceholder as a sane man, in full control of his actions, who simply strove to avoid detection.[240][237] McCann described secondnameplaceholder as a calculating individual who killed to control his victims and retained their bodies "merely to afford" himself a prolonged period of sexual pleasure.[241] McCann argued that by pleading guilty but insane to the charges, secondnameplaceholder was seeking to escape responsibility for his crimes.[237]On February 15, the court reconvened to hear the verdict: secondnameplaceholder was ruled to be sane and not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of each of the 15 murders for which he was tried, although in each count, two of the 12 jurors signified their dissent.[242] Formal sentencing was postponed until February 17. On this date, secondnameplaceholder's attorney announced his client wished to address the court. secondnameplaceholder then approached a lectern and read from a statement prepared by himself and his defense as he faced the judge.[243]In this statement, secondnameplaceholder emphasized that he had never desired freedom following his arrest, and that he "frankly" wished for his own death. He further stressed that none of his murders had been motivated by hatred, that he understood that nothing he either said or did could "undo the terrible harm" he had caused to the families of his victims and the city of Milwaukee, and that he and his doctors believed his criminal behavior had been motivated by mental disorders. secondnameplaceholder added that this medical knowledge had given him "some peace", and that although he understood that society would never forgive him, he hoped God would. secondnameplaceholder closed his statement with the following: "I know my time in prison will be terrible, but I deserve whatever I get because of what I have done. Thank you, your honor, and I am prepared for your sentence, which I know will be the maximum. I ask for no consideration."[244] He then returned to his seat to await formal sentencing.[245]secondnameplaceholder was then sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years upon the first two counts,[246] with the remaining 13 counts carrying a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment plus 70 years. The death penalty was not an option for Judge Gram to consider at the penalty phase, as Wisconsin had abolished capital punishment in 1853.[247]Upon hearing of secondnameplaceholder's sentencing, his father Lionel and stepmother Shari requested to be allowed a ten-minute private meeting with their son before he was transferred to the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, to begin his sentence.[245] This request was granted and the trio exchanged hugs and well-wishes before secondnameplaceholder was escorted away.Three months after his conviction in Milwaukee, secondnameplaceholder was extradited to Ohio to be tried for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks.[248] In a court hearing lasting just 45 minutes,[249] secondnameplaceholder again pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a 16th term of life imprisonment on May 1, 1992.[250]
<h2>Imprisonment and death</h2>
Upon sentencing, secondnameplaceholder was transferred to the Columbia Correctional Institution.[251] For the first year of his incarceration, secondnameplaceholder was placed in solitary confinement due to concerns for his physical safety should he come into contact with fellow inmates. With secondnameplaceholder's consent, after one year in solitary confinement, he was transferred to a less secure unit, where he was assigned a two-hour daily work detail cleaning the toilet block.[252] Shortly after completing his lengthy confessions in 1991, secondnameplaceholder had requested to Detective Murphy that he be given a copy of the Bible.[218] This request was granted and secondnameplaceholder gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father's urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research.[253] In May 1994, secondnameplaceholder was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, in the prison whirlpool.[254][255]Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited secondnameplaceholder on a weekly basis up until November 1994. secondnameplaceholder and Ratcliff regularly discussed the prospect of death, and secondnameplaceholder questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live.[256] Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with Stone Phillips on Dateline NBC, secondnameplaceholder had stated: "If a person doesn't think that there is a God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges? That's how I thought anyway."[257]In July 1994, a fellow inmate, Osvaldo Durruthy, attempted to slash secondnameplaceholder's throat with a razor embedded in a toothbrush as secondnameplaceholder returned to his cell from Ratcliff's weekly church service conducted in the prison chapel.[258] secondnameplaceholder received superficial wounds and was not seriously hurt in this incident. According to secondnameplaceholder's family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he might endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother maintaining regular contact, secondnameplaceholder's mother, Joyce, also maintained regular contact with her son (although prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983).[259] Joyce related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son's physical well-being, secondnameplaceholder responded with comments to the effect of: "It doesn't matter, Mom. I don't care if something happens to me."[256]On the morning of November 28, 1994, secondnameplaceholder left his cell to conduct his assigned work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates: Jesse Anderson and Christopher Scarver. The trio were left unsupervised in the showers of the prison gym for approximately 20 minutes. At approximately 8:10 a.m.[260] secondnameplaceholder was discovered on the floor of the bathrooms of the gym suffering from extreme head wounds;[261][262] he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a 20-inch (51-centimeter) metal bar.[260] His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault.[263] Although secondnameplaceholder was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later. Anderson had also been beaten with the same instrument, and died two days later from his wounds.[256][264]Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked secondnameplaceholder with the metal bar as he (secondnameplaceholder) was cleaning a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as he (Anderson) cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, secondnameplaceholder did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver, who was thought to be schizophrenic, returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: "God told me to do it. Jesse Anderson and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder are dead."[265][263][266] Scarver was adamant he had not planned the attacks in advance,[267] although he later divulged to investigators he had concealed the 20-inch iron bar used to kill both men in his clothing shortly before the killings.[266][n 9]Upon learning of his death, secondnameplaceholder's mother Joyce responded angrily to the media: "Now is everybody happy? Now that he's bludgeoned to death, is that good enough for everyone?"[268] The response of the families of secondnameplaceholder's victims was mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death. The district attorney who prosecuted secondnameplaceholder cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, noting that secondnameplaceholder's death was still murder.[256] On May 15, 1995, Scarver was sentenced to two additional terms of life imprisonment for the murders of secondnameplaceholder and Anderson.[269]Although Scarver had confessed in 1994 to having concealed the weapon used to kill secondnameplaceholder and Anderson in his clothing on the morning of the murders, in 2015, he publicly stated the murders of secondnameplaceholder and Anderson had resulted from a confrontation in which one of the two men had poked him (Scarver) in the back as the three had begun their assigned work detail. In this renewed account of events, Scarver claimed that the two had laughed at him when he had turned around in response before secondnameplaceholder and Anderson each walked to separate rooms to begin their cleaning duty, with Scarver following secondnameplaceholder toward the staff locker room.[270]Scarver alleges that immediately before murdering secondnameplaceholder, he had cornered him, presented a newspaper article detailing secondnameplaceholder's crimes, and demanded that secondnameplaceholder answer whether the account was true.[270] Scarver further alleged he had been revolted by secondnameplaceholder's crimes and that secondnameplaceholder had been openly unrepentant; that secondnameplaceholder taunted prison employees and fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into imitations of severed limbs, complete with ketchup to simulate blood spattering; and that prison staff, knowing of Scarver's hatred for secondnameplaceholder, had deliberately left the two men unsupervised so that he could kill him.[270] Furthermore, Scarver stated that secondnameplaceholder was so disliked by fellow inmates that he required a personal escort of at least one guard whenever he was out of his cell to prevent inmates from attacking him.secondnameplaceholder had stated in his will that he wished for no services to be conducted and that he wished to be cremated.[271] In September 1995, secondnameplaceholder's body was cremated, and his ashes divided between his parents.[272]On August 5, 1991, as the nature and scale of secondnameplaceholder's crimes initially came to light, a candlelight vigil to celebrate and heal the Milwaukee community[273] was attended by more than 400 people. Present at the vigil were community leaders, gay rights activists, and family members of several of secondnameplaceholder's victims. Organizers stated the purpose of the vigil was to enable Milwaukeeans to "share their feelings of pain and anger over what happened".[274]The Oxford Apartments at 924 North 25th Street, where secondnameplaceholder had killed twelve of his victims, were demolished in November 1992.[275] The site is now a vacant lot. Alternate plans to convert the site into either a memorial garden, a playground, or to reconstruct new housing have failed to materialize.secondnameplaceholder's estate was awarded to the families of 11 of his victims who had sued for damages. In 1996, Thomas Jacobson, a lawyer representing eight of the families, announced a planned auction of secondnameplaceholder's estate. Although victims' relatives stated the motivation was not greed, the announcement sparked controversy.[276][277] A civic group, Milwaukee Civic Pride, was quickly established in an effort to raise the funds to purchase and destroy secondnameplaceholder's possessions. The group pledged $407,225, including a $100,000 gift by Milwaukee real estate developer Joseph Zilber, for purchase of secondnameplaceholder's estate; five of the eight families represented by Jacobson agreed to the terms, and secondnameplaceholder's possessions were subsequently destroyed and buried in an undisclosed Illinois landfill.[278]Lionel secondnameplaceholder is retired and now lives with his second wife, Shari. Both have refused to change their surname and have professed their love of secondnameplaceholder in spite of his crimes. In 1994, Lionel published a book, A Father's Story, and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims' families. Most of the families showed support for Lionel and Shari, although three families subsequently sued Lionel: two for using their names in the book without obtaining prior consent;[279] and a third family—that of Steven Hicks—filing a wrongful death suit against Lionel, Shari, and former wife Joyce, citing parental negligence as the cause for the claim.[280]Joyce Flint died of cancer in November 2000. Prior to her death, she had attempted suicide on at least one occasion.[281] secondnameplaceholder's younger brother, David, changed his surname and lives in anonymity.[282]
<h2>Known murder victims</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is known to have killed 17 young men between 1978 and 1991. Of these victims, 12 were killed in his North 25th Street apartment. Three further victims were murdered and dismembered at his grandmother's West Allis residence, with his first and second victims being murdered at his parents' home in Ohio and at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, respectively. A total of 14 of secondnameplaceholder's victims were from various ethnic minority backgrounds, with nine victims being black. secondnameplaceholder was adamant that the race of his victims was incidental to him and that it was the body form of a potential victim that attracted his attention.[251][n 10]Most of secondnameplaceholder's victims were killed by strangulation after being drugged with sedatives, although his first victim was killed by a combination of bludgeoning and strangulation and his second victim was battered to death, with one further victim killed in 1990, Ernest Miller, dying of a combination of shock and blood loss due to his carotid artery being cut.[2] Four of secondnameplaceholder's victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which secondnameplaceholder injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, into the frontal lobes [285] in an attempt to induce a permanent, submissive, unresistant state. This proved fatal although on each occasion, this was not secondnameplaceholder's intention.[168]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder Woodson secondnameplaceholder (September 5, 1847 – April 3, 1882) was an American outlaw, bank and train robber, guerrilla, and leader of the secondnameplaceholder–Younger Gang. Raised in the "Little Dixie" area of western Missouri, secondnameplaceholder and his family maintained strong Southern sympathies. He and his brother Frank secondnameplaceholder joined pro-Confederate guerrillas known as "bushwhackers" operating in Missouri and Kansas during the American Civil War. As followers of William Quantrill and "Bloody Bill" Anderson, they were accused of committing atrocities against Union soldiers and civilian abolitionists, including the Centralia Massacre in 1864.After the war, as members of various gangs of outlaws, firstnameplaceholder and Frank robbed banks, stagecoaches, and trains across the Midwest, gaining national fame and often popular sympathy despite the brutality of their crimes. The secondnameplaceholder brothers were most active as members of their own gang from about 1866 until 1876, when as a result of their attempted robbery of a bank in Northfield, Minnesota, several members of the gang were captured or killed. They continued in crime for several years afterward, recruiting new members, but came under increasing pressure from law enforcement seeking to bring them to justice. On April 3, 1882, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was shot and killed by Robert Ford, a new recruit to the gang who hoped to collect a reward on secondnameplaceholder's head and a promised amnesty for his previous crimes. Already a celebrity in life, secondnameplaceholder became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death.Despite popular portrayals of secondnameplaceholder as an embodiment of Robin Hood, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, there is no evidence that he and his gang shared any loot from their robberies with anyone outside their close kinship network.[1] Scholars and historians have characterized secondnameplaceholder as one of many criminals inspired by the regional insurgencies of ex-Confederates following the Civil War, rather than as a manifestation of alleged economic justice or of frontier lawlessness.[2] secondnameplaceholder continues to be one of the most famous figures from the era, and his life has been dramatized and memorialized numerous times.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder Woodson secondnameplaceholder was born on September 5, 1847, in Clay County, Missouri, near the site of present-day Kearney.[3] This area of Missouri was largely settled by people from the Upper South, especially Kentucky and Tennessee, and became known as Little Dixie for this reason. secondnameplaceholder had two full siblings: his elder brother, Alexander Franklin "Frank" secondnameplaceholder, and a younger sister, Susan Lavenia secondnameplaceholder. He was of English, Welsh and Scottish descent. His father, Robert S. secondnameplaceholder, farmed commercial hemp in Kentucky and was a Baptist minister before coming to Missouri. After he married, he migrated to Bradford, Missouri and helped found William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri.[2] He held six slaves and more than 100 acres (0.40 km2) of farmland.Robert traveled to California during the Gold Rush to minister to those searching for gold;[4] he died there when secondnameplaceholder was three years old.[5] After Robert's death, his widow Zerelda remarried twice, first to Benjamin Simms in 1852 and then in 1855 to Dr. Reuben Samuel, who moved into the secondnameplaceholder family home. firstnameplaceholder's mother and Samuel had four children together: Sarah Louisa, John Thomas, Fannie Quantrell, and Archie Peyton Samuel.[4][6] Zerelda and Samuel acquired a total of seven slaves, who served mainly as farmhands in tobacco cultivation.[6][7]
<h2>Historical context</h2>
The approach of the American Civil War loomed large in the secondnameplaceholder–Samuel household. Missouri was a border state, sharing characteristics of both North and South, but 75% of the population was from the South or other border states.[4] Clay County in particular was strongly influenced by the Southern culture of its rural pioneer families. Farmers raised the same crops and livestock as in the areas from which they had migrated. They brought slaves with them and purchased more according to their needs. The county counted more slaveholders and more slaves than most other regions of the state; in Missouri as a whole, slaves accounted for only 10 percent of the population, but in Clay County, they constituted 25 percent.[8] Aside from slavery, the culture of Little Dixie was Southern in other ways as well. This influenced how the population acted during and for a period of time after the war.After the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, Clay County became the scene of great turmoil as the question of whether slavery would be expanded into the neighboring Kansas Territory bred tension and hostility. Many people from Missouri migrated to Kansas to try to influence its future. Much of the dramatic build-up to the Civil War centered on the violence that erupted on the Kansas–Missouri border between pro- and anti-slavery militias.[7][9]
<h2>American Civil War</h2>
After a series of campaigns and battles between conventional armies in 1861, guerrilla warfare gripped Missouri, waged between secessionist "bushwhackers" and Union forces which largely consisted of local militias known as "jayhawkers". A bitter conflict ensued, resulting in an escalating cycle of atrocities committed by both sides. Confederate guerrillas murdered civilian Unionists, executed prisoners, and scalped the dead. The Union presence enforced martial law with raids on homes, arrests of civilians, summary executions, and banishment of Confederate sympathizers from the state.[10]The secondnameplaceholder–Samuel family sided with the Confederates at the outbreak of war.[11] Frank secondnameplaceholder joined a local company recruited for the secessionist Drew Lobbs Army, and fought at the Battle of Wilson's Creek in August 1861. He fell ill and returned home soon afterward. In 1863, he was identified as a member of a guerrilla squad that operated in Clay County. In May of that year, a Union militia company raided the secondnameplaceholder–Samuel farm looking for Frank's group. They tortured Reuben Samuel by briefly hanging him from a tree. According to legend, they lashed young firstnameplaceholder.[4]Frank secondnameplaceholder eluded capture and was believed to have joined the guerrilla organization led by William C. Quantrill known as Quantrill's Raiders. It is thought that he took part in the notorious massacre of some two hundred men and boys in Lawrence, Kansas, a center of abolitionists.[12][13] Frank followed Quantrill to Sherman, Texas over the winter of 1863–1864. In the spring he returned in a squad commanded by Fletch Taylor. After they arrived in Clay County, 16-year-old firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder joined his brother in Taylor's group.[4]Taylor was severely wounded in the summer of 1864, losing his right arm to a shotgun blast. The secondnameplaceholder brothers then joined the bushwhacker group led by William "Bloody Bill" Anderson. firstnameplaceholder suffered a serious wound to the chest that summer. The Clay County provost marshal reported that both Frank and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder took part in the Centralia Massacre in September, in which guerrillas stopped a train carrying unarmed Union soldiers returning home from duty and killed or wounded some 22 of them; the guerrillas scalped and dismembered some of the dead. The guerrillas also ambushed and defeated a pursuing regiment of Major A.V.E. Johnson's Union troops, killing all who tried to surrender, who numbered more than 100. Frank later identified firstnameplaceholder as a member of the band who had fatally shot Major Johnson.[14]As a result of the secondnameplaceholder brothers' activities, Union military authorities forced their family to leave Clay County. Though ordered to move South beyond Union lines, they moved north across the nearby state border into Nebraska Territory.[15]After "Bloody Bill" Anderson was killed in an ambush in October, the secondnameplaceholder brothers separated. Frank followed Quantrill into Kentucky, while firstnameplaceholder went to Texas under the command of Archie Clement, one of Anderson's lieutenants. He is known to have returned to Missouri in the spring.[14] At the age of 17, firstnameplaceholder suffered the second of two life-threatening chest wounds when he was shot while trying to surrender after they ran into a Union cavalry patrol near Lexington, Missouri.[16][17]
<h2>After the Civil War</h2>
At the end of the Civil War, Missouri remained deeply divided. The conflict split the population into three bitterly opposed factions: anti-slavery Unionists identified with the Republican Party; segregationist conservative Unionists identified with the Democratic Party; and pro-slavery, ex-Confederate secessionists, many of whom were also allied with the Democrats, especially in the southern part of the state.The Republican-dominated Reconstruction legislature passed a new state constitution that freed Missouri's slaves. It temporarily excluded former Confederates from voting, serving on juries, becoming corporate officers, or preaching from church pulpits. The atmosphere was volatile, with widespread clashes between individuals and between armed gangs of veterans from both sides of the war.[18][19]firstnameplaceholder recovered from his chest wound at his uncle's boardinghouse in Harlem, Missouri (north across the Missouri River from the City of Kansas' River Quay [changed to Kansas City in 1889]). He was tended to by his first cousin, Zerelda "Zee" Mimms, named after firstnameplaceholder's mother.[14] firstnameplaceholder and his cousin began a nine-year courtship that culminated in their marriage. Meanwhile, his former commander Archie Clement kept his bushwhacker gang together and began to harass Republican authorities.[11]These men were the likely culprits in the first daylight armed bank robbery in the United States during peacetime,[20] the robbery of the Clay County Savings Association in the town of Liberty, Missouri, on February 13, 1866. The bank was owned by Republican former militia officers. They had recently conducted the first Republican Party rally in Clay County's history. During the gang's escape from the town, an innocent bystander, 17-year-old George C. "Jolly" Wymore, a student at William Jewell College, was shot dead on the street.[21]It remains unclear whether firstnameplaceholder and Frank took part in the Clay County robbery. After the secondnameplaceholder brothers successfully conducted other robberies and became legendary, some observers retroactively credited them with being the leaders of the robbery.[14] Others have argued that firstnameplaceholder was at the time still bedridden with his wound and could not have participated. No evidence has been found that connects either brother to the crime, nor conclusively rules them out.[22] On June 13, 1866, in Jackson County, Missouri, the gang freed two jailed members of Quantrill's gang, killing the jailer in the effort.[23] Historians believe that the secondnameplaceholder brothers were involved in this crime.Local violence continued to increase in the state; Governor Thomas Clement Fletcher had recently ordered a company of militia into Johnson County to suppress guerrilla activity.[24] Archie Clement continued his career of crime and harassment of the Republican government, to the extent of occupying the town of Lexington, Missouri on election day in 1866. Shortly afterward, the state militia shot Clement dead. secondnameplaceholder wrote about this death with bitterness a decade later.[21][22]The survivors of Clement's gang continued to conduct bank robberies during the next two years, though their numbers dwindled through arrests, gunfights, and lynchings. While they later tried to justify robbing the banks, most of their targets were small, local banks based on local capital, and the robberies only penalized the locals they claimed to support.[25] On May 23, 1867, for example, they robbed a bank in Richmond, Missouri, in which they killed the mayor and two others.[14][26] It remains uncertain whether either of the secondnameplaceholder brothers took part, although an eyewitness who knew the brothers told a newspaper seven years later "positively and emphatically that he recognized firstnameplaceholder and Frank secondnameplaceholder ... among the robbers."[27] In 1868, Frank and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder allegedly joined Cole Younger in robbing a bank in Russellville, Kentucky.firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder did not become well known until December 7, 1869, when he and (most likely) Frank robbed the Daviess County Savings Association in Gallatin, Missouri. The robbery netted little money. firstnameplaceholder is believed to have shot and killed the cashier, Captain John Sheets, mistakenly believing him to be Samuel P. Cox, the militia officer who had killed "Bloody Bill" Anderson during the Civil War.[28]secondnameplaceholder claimed he was taking revenge, and the daring escape he and Frank made through the middle of a posse shortly afterward attracted newspaper coverage for the first time.[29][30] An 1882 history of Daviess County said, "The history of Daviess County has no blacker crime in its pages than the murder of John W. Sheets."[31]The only known civil case involving Frank and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was filed in the Common Pleas Court of Daviess County in 1870. In the case, Daniel Smoote asked for $223.50 from Frank and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder to replace a horse, saddle, and bridle stolen as they fled the robbery of the Daviess County Savings Bank. The brothers denied the charges, saying they were not in Daviess County on December 7, the day the robbery occurred. Frank and firstnameplaceholder failed to appear in court, and Smoote won his case against them.[32] It is unlikely that he ever collected the money due.The 1869 robbery marked the emergence of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder as the most famous survivor of the former Confederate bushwhackers. It was the first time he was publicly labeled an "outlaw"; Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden set a reward for his capture.[31] This was the beginning of an alliance between secondnameplaceholder and John Newman Edwards, editor and founder of the Kansas City Times. Edwards, a former Confederate cavalryman, was campaigning to return former secessionists to power in Missouri. Six months after the Gallatin robbery, Edwards published the first of many letters from firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder to the public, asserting his innocence. Over time, the letters gradually became more political in tone and secondnameplaceholder denounced the Republicans and expressed his pride in his Confederate loyalties. Together with Edwards's admiring editorials, the letters helped secondnameplaceholder become a symbol of Confederate defiance of federal Reconstruction policy. secondnameplaceholder' initiative in creating his rising public profile is debated by historians and biographers. The high tensions in politics accompanied his outlaw career and enhanced his notoriety.[30][33]
<h2>James–Younger Gang</h2>
Meanwhile, the secondnameplaceholder brothers joined with Cole Younger and his brothers John, Jim, and Bob, as well as Clell Miller and other former Confederates, to form what came to be known as the secondnameplaceholder–Younger Gang. With firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder as the most public face of the gang (though with operational leadership likely shared among the group), the gang carried out a string of robberies from Iowa to Texas, and from Kansas to West Virginia.[34] They robbed banks, stagecoaches, and a fair in Kansas City, often carrying out their crimes in front of crowds, and even hamming it up for the bystanders.On July 21, 1873, they turned to train robbery, derailing a Rock Island Line train west of Adair, Iowa and stealing approximately $3,000 (equivalent to $65,000 in 2020). For this, they wore Ku Klux Klan masks. By this time, the Klan had been suppressed in the South by President Grant's use of the Enforcement Acts. Former rebels attacked the railroads as symbols of threatening centralization.[35]The gang's later train robberies had a lighter touch. The gang held up passengers only twice, choosing in all other incidents to take only the contents of the express safe in the baggage car. John Newman Edwards made sure to highlight such techniques when creating an image of secondnameplaceholder as a kind of Robin Hood. Despite public sentiment toward the gang's crimes, there is no evidence that the secondnameplaceholder gang ever shared any of the robbery money outside their personal circle.[33]firstnameplaceholder and his cousin Zee married on April 24, 1874. They had two children who survived to adulthood: firstnameplaceholder Edward secondnameplaceholder (b. 1875) and Mary Susan secondnameplaceholder (later Barr, b. 1879).[36] Twins Gould and Montgomery secondnameplaceholder (b. 1878) died in infancy. firstnameplaceholder Jr. became a lawyer who practiced in Kansas City, Missouri and Los Angeles, California.[37]In 1874, the Adams Express Company turned to the Pinkerton National Detective Agency to stop the secondnameplaceholder–Younger Gang. The Chicago-based agency worked primarily against urban professional criminals, as well as providing industrial security, such as strike breaking. Because the gang received support by many former Confederate soldiers in Missouri, they eluded the Pinkertons. Joseph Whicher, an agent dispatched to infiltrate Zerelda Samuel's farm, was soon found killed. Two other agents, Captain Louis J. Lull and John Boyle, were sent after the Youngers; Lull was killed by two of the Youngers in a roadside gunfight on March 17, 1874. Before he died, Lull fatally shot John Younger. A deputy sheriff named Edwin Daniels also died in the skirmish.[38][39]Allan Pinkerton, the agency's founder and leader, took on the case as a personal vendetta. He began to work with former Unionists who lived near the secondnameplaceholder family farm. On the night of January 25, 1875, he staged a raid on the homestead. Detectives threw an incendiary device into the house; it exploded, killing secondnameplaceholder's young half-brother Archie (named for Archie Clement) and blowing off one of Zerelda Samuel's arms. Afterward, Pinkerton denied that the raid's intent was arson. But biographer Ted Yeatman found a letter by Pinkerton in the Library of Congress in which Pinkerton declared his intention to "burn the house down."[40][41]Many residents were outraged by the raid on the family home. The Missouri state legislature narrowly defeated a bill that praised the secondnameplaceholder and Younger brothers and offered them amnesty.[11] Allowed to vote and hold office again, former Confederates in the legislature voted to limit the size of rewards the governor could offer for fugitives. This extended a measure of protection over the secondnameplaceholder–Younger gang by minimizing the incentive for attempting to capture them. The governor had offered rewards higher than the new limit only on Frank and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[42][43]Across a creek and up a hill from the secondnameplaceholder house was the home of Daniel Askew, who is thought to have been killed by secondnameplaceholder or his gang on April 12, 1875. They may have suspected Askew of cooperating with the Pinkertons in the January 1875 arson of the secondnameplaceholder house.[citation needed]On September 7, 1876, the opening day of hunting season in Minnesota, the secondnameplaceholder–Younger gang attempted a raid on the First National Bank of Northfield, Minnesota. The robbery quickly went wrong, however, and after the robbery, only Frank and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder remained alive and free.[44]Cole and Bob Younger later said they selected the bank because they believed it was associated with the Republican politician Adelbert Ames, the governor of Mississippi during Reconstruction, and Union general Benjamin Butler, Ames' father-in-law and the Union commander of occupied New Orleans. Ames was a stockholder in the bank, but Butler had no direct connection to it.[45]The gang attempted to rob the bank in Northfield at about 2 pm. To carry out the robbery, the gang divided into two groups. Three men entered the bank, two guarded the door outside, and three remained near a bridge across an adjacent square. The robbers inside the bank were thwarted when acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe, falsely claiming that it was secured by a time lock even as they held a Bowie knife to his throat and cracked his skull with a pistol butt. Assistant cashier Alonzo Enos Bunker was wounded in the shoulder as he fled through the back door of the bank. Meanwhile, the citizens of Northfield grew suspicious of the men guarding the door and raised the alarm. The five bandits outside fired into the air to clear the streets, driving the townspeople to take cover and fire back from protected positions. They shot two bandits dead and wounded the rest in the barrage. Inside, the outlaws turned to flee. As they left, one shot the unarmed cashier Heywood in the head. Historians have speculated about the identity of the shooter but have not reached consensus.The gang barely escaped Northfield, leaving two dead companions behind. They killed Heywood and Nicholas Gustafson, a Swedish immigrant from the Millersburg community west of Northfield. A substantial manhunt ensued. It is believed that the gang burned 14 Rice County mills shortly after the robbery.[46] The secondnameplaceholder brothers eventually split from the others and escaped to Missouri. The militia soon discovered the Youngers and one other bandit, Charlie Pitts. In a gunfight, Pitts died and the Youngers were taken prisoner. Except for Frank and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, the secondnameplaceholder–Younger Gang was destroyed.[47][48]Later in 1876, firstnameplaceholder and Frank secondnameplaceholder surfaced in the Nashville, Tennessee area, where they went by the names of Thomas Howard and B. J. Woodson, respectively. Frank seemed to settle down, but firstnameplaceholder remained restless. He recruited a new gang in 1879 and returned to crime, holding up a train at Glendale, Missouri (now part of Independence),[49] on October 8, 1879. The robbery was the first in a spree of crimes, including the hold-up of the federal paymaster of a canal project in Killen, Alabama, and two more train robberies. But the new gang was not made up of battle-hardened guerrillas; they soon turned against each other or were captured. secondnameplaceholder grew suspicious of other members; he scared away one man and some believe that he killed another gang member.In 1879, the secondnameplaceholder gang robbed two stores in far western Mississippi, at Washington in Adams County and Fayette in Jefferson County. The gang left with $2,000 cash from the second robbery and took shelter in abandoned cabins on the Kemp Plantation south of St. Joseph, Louisiana. A law enforcement posse attacked and killed two of the outlaws but failed to capture the entire gang. Among the deputies was Jefferson B. Snyder, later a long-serving district attorney in northeastern Louisiana.[50]By 1881, with local Tennessee authorities growing suspicious, the brothers returned to Missouri, where they felt safer. secondnameplaceholder moved his family to St. Joseph, Missouri in November 1881, not far from where he had been born and reared. Frank, however, decided to move to safer territory and headed east to settle in Virginia. They intended to give up crime. The secondnameplaceholder gang had been reduced to the two of them.[51][52]With his gang nearly annihilated, secondnameplaceholder trusted only the Ford brothers, Charley and Robert.[53] Although Charley had been out on raids with secondnameplaceholder, Bob Ford was an eager new recruit. For protection, secondnameplaceholder asked the Ford brothers to move in with him and his family. secondnameplaceholder had often stayed with their sister Martha Bolton and, according to rumor, he was "smitten" with her.[1] By that time, Bob Ford had conducted secret negotiations with Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden, planning to bring in the famous outlaw.[53] Crittenden had made capture of the secondnameplaceholder brothers his top priority; in his inaugural address he declared that no political motives could be allowed to keep them from justice. Barred by law from offering a large reward, he had turned to the railroad and express corporations to put up a $5,000 bounty for the delivery of each of them and an additional $5,000 for the conviction of either of them.[54]On April 3, 1882, after eating breakfast, the Fords and secondnameplaceholderes went into the living room before traveling to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, secondnameplaceholder had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that secondnameplaceholder had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, secondnameplaceholder walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon and shot the unarmed firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in the back of the head.[56][57][58]
secondnameplaceholder' two previous bullet wounds and partially missing middle finger served to positively identify the body.[14]The death of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder became a national sensation. The Fords made no attempt to hide their role. Robert Ford wired the governor to claim his reward. Crowds pressed into the little house in St. Joseph to see the dead bandit. The Ford brothers surrendered to the authorities and were dismayed to be charged with first-degree murder. In the course of a single day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, were sentenced to death by hanging, and were granted a full pardon by Governor Crittenden.[59] The governor's quick pardon suggested he knew the brothers intended to kill secondnameplaceholder rather than capture him. The implication that the chief executive of Missouri conspired to kill a private citizen startled the public and added to secondnameplaceholder' notoriety.[60][61][62]After receiving a small portion of the reward, the Fords fled Missouri. Sheriff secondnameplaceholder Timberlake and Marshal Henry H. Craig, who were law enforcement officials active in the plan, were awarded the majority of the bounty.[63] Later, the Ford brothers starred in a touring stage show in which they re-enacted the shooting.[64][65] Public opinion was divided between those against the Fords for murdering firstnameplaceholder, and those of the opinion that it had been time for the outlaw to be stopped. Suffering from tuberculosis (then incurable) and a morphine addiction, Charley Ford committed suicide on May 6, 1884, in Richmond, Missouri. Bob Ford operated a tent saloon in Creede, Colorado. On June 8, 1892, Edward O'Kelley went to Creede, loaded a double-barrel shotgun, entered Ford's saloon and said "Hello, Bob," before shooting Ford in the throat, killing him instantly. O'Kelley was sentenced to life in prison, but his sentence was subsequently commuted because of a 7,000-signature petition in favor of his release, as well as a medical condition. The Governor of Colorado pardoned him on October 3, 1902.[66]secondnameplaceholder's original grave was on his family property, but he was later moved to a cemetery in Kearney. The original footstone is still there, although the family has replaced the headstone. secondnameplaceholder's mother Zerelda Samuel wrote the following epitaph for him: "In Loving Memory of my Beloved Son, Murdered by a Traitor and Coward Whose Name is not Worthy to Appear Here."[53] secondnameplaceholder' widow Zerelda Mimms secondnameplaceholder died alone and in poverty.Rumors of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's survival proliferated almost as soon as the newspapers announced his death. Some said that Robert Ford killed someone other than secondnameplaceholder in an elaborate plot to allow him to escape justice.[11] These tales have received little credence, then or since. None of secondnameplaceholder' biographers accepted them as plausible. The body buried in Kearney, Missouri marked firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was exhumed in 1995 and subjected to mitochondrial DNA typing. The report, prepared by Anne C. Stone, Ph.D., secondnameplaceholder E. Starrs, L.L.M., and Mark Stoneking, Ph.D., confirmed the mtDNA recovered from the remains was consistent with the mtDNA of one of secondnameplaceholder's relatives in the female line.[67]The theme of survival was featured in a 2009 documentary, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' Hidden Treasure, which aired on the History Channel. The documentary was dismissed as pseudo-history and pseudoscience by historian Nancy Samuelson in a review she wrote for the Winter 2009–2010 edition of The secondnameplaceholder-Younger Gang Journal.[68]J. Frank Dalton claimed to be firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder; he died August 15, 1951, in Granbury, Texas.[69] Dalton was allegedly 101 years old at the time of his first public appearance, in May 1948. Oran Baker, Hood County Sheriff, conducted a visual post-mortem exam and found he had thirty-two bullet wounds and a rope burn around his neck. He was buried in Granbury Cemetery, where the headstone bears the name of "firstnameplaceholder Woodson secondnameplaceholder".[70] His story did not hold up to questioning from secondnameplaceholder' surviving relatives.[71]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's turn to crime after the end of the Reconstruction era helped cement his place in American life and memory as a simple but remarkably effective bandit. After 1873, he was covered by the national media as part of social banditry.[72] During his lifetime, secondnameplaceholder was celebrated chiefly by former Confederates, to whom he appealed directly in his letters to the press. Displaced by Reconstruction, the antebellum political leadership mythologized the secondnameplaceholder Gang exploits. Frank Triplett wrote about secondnameplaceholder as a "progressive neo-aristocrat" with "purity of race".[73] Some historians credit secondnameplaceholder' myth as contributing to the rise of former Confederates to dominance in Missouri politics.[citation needed] In the 1880s, both U.S. Senators from the state, former Confederate military commander Francis Cockrell, and former Confederate Congressman George Graham Vest, were identified with the Confederate cause.In the 1880s, after secondnameplaceholder' death, the secondnameplaceholder Gang became the subject of dime novels that represented the bandits as pre-industrial models of resistance.[73] During the Populist and Progressive eras, secondnameplaceholder became an icon as America's Robin Hood, standing up against corporations in defense of the small farmer, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. There is no evidence that he shared the loot of his robberies with anyone other than his gang members; only they enjoyed the riches with him.[1]In the 1950s, secondnameplaceholder was pictured as a psychologically troubled man rather than a social rebel. Some filmmakers portrayed the former outlaw as a revenger, replacing "social with exclusively personal motives."[74] While his "heroic outlaw" image is commonly portrayed in films, as well as in songs and folklore, since the late 20th century, historians such as Stiles have classified him as a self-aware vigilante and terrorist who used local tensions to create his own myth among the widespread insurgent guerrillas and vigilantes following the American Civil War.[2]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder remains a controversial symbol, one who can always be reinterpreted in various ways according to cultural tensions and needs. Some of the neo-Confederate movement regard him as a hero.[60][75][76] But renewed cultural battles over the place of the Civil War in American history have replaced the long-standing interpretation of secondnameplaceholder as a Western frontier hero.Museums and sites devoted to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder:The Defeat of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Days in Northfield, Minnesota, is among the largest outdoor celebrations in the state.[88] It is held annually in September during the weekend after Labor Day. Thousands of visitors watch reenactments of the robbery, a championship rodeo, a carnival, performances of a 19th-century style melodrama musical, and a parade during the five-day event.[89]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's boyhood home in Kearney, Missouri, is operated as a museum dedicated to the town's most famous resident. Each year a recreational fair, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Festival, is held during the third weekend in September.[90]The annual Victorian Festival in Jersey County, Illinois is held on Labor Day weekend[91] at the 1866 Col. William H. Fulkerson estate Hazel Dell. Festivities include telling firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's history in stories and by reenactments of stagecoach holdups. Over the three-day event, thousands of spectators learn of the documented secondnameplaceholder Gang's stopover at Hazel Dell and of their connection with ex-Confederate Fulkerson.Russellville, Kentucky, the site of the robbery of the Southern Bank in 1868, holds a reenactment of the robbery every year as of the Logan County Tobacco and Heritage Festival.[92]The small town of Oak Grove, Louisiana, also hosts a town-wide annual firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Outlaw Roundup Festival, usually in the early to mid-autumn. This is a reference to a short time secondnameplaceholder supposedly spent near this area.[93]

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (May 10, 1838 – April 26, 1865) was an American stage actor who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. A member of the prominent 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland,[1] he was a noted actor who was also a Confederate sympathizer; denouncing President Lincoln, he lamented the recent abolition of slavery in the United States.[2]Originally, Booth and his small group of conspirators had plotted to kidnap Lincoln, and they later agreed to murder him as well as Vice President Andrew firstnameplaceholderson and Secretary of State William H. Seward, likewise to aid the Confederate cause.[3] Although its Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Robert E. Lee, had surrendered to the Union Army four days earlier, Booth believed that the Civil War remained unresolved because the Confederate Army of General Joseph E. firstnameplaceholderston continued fighting.Booth shot President Lincoln once in the back of the head. Lincoln's death the next morning completed Booth's piece of the plot. Seward, severely wounded, recovered, whereas Vice President firstnameplaceholderson was never attacked. Booth fled on horseback to Southern Maryland; twelve days later, at a farm in rural Northern Virginia, he was tracked down sheltered in a barn. Booth's companion David Herold surrendered, but Booth maintained a standoff. After the authorities set the barn ablaze, Union soldier Boston Corbett fatally shot him in the neck. Paralyzed, he died a few hours later. Of the eight conspirators later convicted, four were soon hanged.
<h2>Background and early life</h2>
Booth's parents were noted British Shakespearean actor Junius Brutus Booth and his mistress, Mary Ann Holmes, who moved to the United States from England in June 1821.[4] They purchased a 150-acre (61 ha) farm near Bel Air, Maryland, where firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born in a four-room log house on May 10, 1838, the ninth of ten children.[5] He was named after English radical politician firstnameplaceholder Wilkes, a distant relative.[6][7] Junius' wife Adelaide Delannoy Booth was granted a divorce in 1851 on grounds of adultery, and Holmes legally wed Junius on May 10, 1851, firstnameplaceholder Wilkes' 13th birthday.[8] Nora Titone suggests in her book My Thoughts Be Bloody (2010) that the shame and ambition of Junius Brutus Booth's actor sons Edwin and firstnameplaceholder Wilkes eventually spurred them to strive for achievement and acclaim as rivals—Edwin as a Unionist and firstnameplaceholder Wilkes as the assassin of Abraham Lincoln.[9]Booth's father built Tudor Hall on the Harford County property as the family's summer home in 1851, while also maintaining a winter residence on Exeter Street in Baltimore.[10][11][12][13] The Booth family was listed as living in Baltimore in the 1850 census.[14]As a boy, Booth was athletic and popular, and he became skilled at horsemanship and fencing.[15] He attended the Bel Air Academy and was an indifferent student whom the headmaster described as "not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time".[16] In 1850–1851, he attended the Quaker-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks, Maryland, and later St. Timothy's Hall, an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville, Maryland.[17] At the Milton school, students recited classical works by such authors as Cicero, Herodotus, and Tacitus.[18] Students at St. Timothy's wore military uniforms and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline.[18] Booth left school at 14 after his father's death.[19]While attending the Milton Boarding School, Booth met a Romani fortune-teller who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling him that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young and "meeting a bad end".[20] His sister recalled that he wrote down the palm-reader's prediction, showed it to his family and others, and often discussed its portents in moments of melancholy.[20][21]By age 16, Booth was interested in the theater and in politics, and he became a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis, the anti-immigrant party's candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections.[22] Booth aspired to follow in the footsteps of his father and his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.[23]
<h2>Theatrical career</h2>
Booth made his stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855 in the supporting role of the Earl of Richmond in Richard III at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre.[24][25][26][27] The audience jeered at him when he missed some of his lines.[25][28] He also began acting at Baltimore's Holliday Street Theater, owned by firstnameplaceholder T. Ford, where the Booths had performed frequently.[29] In 1857 he joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, where he played for a full season.[30] At his request, he was billed as "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison with other members of his famous thespian family.[25][31] Jim Bishop wrote that Booth "developed into an outrageous scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him."[28] In February 1858, he played in Lucrezia Borgia at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright and stumbled over one of his lines. Instead of introducing himself by saying, "Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo", he stammered, "Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet—Pedolfio Pat—Pantuchio Ped—dammit! Who am I?", causing the audience to roar with laughter.[25][32]Later that year, Booth played the part of Mohegan Indian Chief Uncas in a play staged in Petersburg, Virginia, and then became a stock company actor at the Richmond Theatre in Virginia, where he became increasingly popular with audiences for his energetic performances.[33] On October 5, 1858, he played the part of Horatio in Hamlet, alongside his older brother Edwin in the title role. Afterward, Edwin led him to the theater's footlights and said to the audience, "I think he's done well, don't you?" In response, the audience applauded loudly and cried, "Yes! Yes!"[33] In all, Booth performed in 83 plays in 1858. Booth said that, of all Shakespearean characters, his favorite role was Brutus, the slayer of a tyrant.[34]Some critics called Booth "the handsomest man in America" and a "natural genius", and noted his having an "astonishing memory"; others were mixed in their estimation of his acting.[34][35] He stood 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic.[36] Noted Civil War reporter George Alfred Townsend described him as a "muscular, perfect man" with "curling hair, like a Corinthian capital".[37] Booth's stage performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical, with him leaping upon the stage and gesturing with passion.[36][38] He was an excellent swordsman, although a fellow actor once recalled that Booth occasionally cut himself with his own sword.[36]Historian Benjamin Platt Thomas wrote that Booth "won celebrity with theater-goers by his romantic personal attraction", and that he was "too impatient for hard study" and his "brilliant talents had failed of full development."[38] Author Gene Smith wrote that Booth's acting may not have been as precise as his brother Edwin's, but his strikingly handsome appearance enthralled women.[39] As the 1850s drew to a close, Booth was becoming wealthy as an actor, earning $20,000 a year (equivalent to about $576,000 more recently).[40]Booth embarked on his first national tour as a leading actor after finishing the 1859–1860 theatre season in Richmond, Virginia. He engaged Philadelphia attorney Matthew Canning to serve as his agent.[41] By mid-1860, he was playing in such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Columbus, Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans.[28][42] Poet and journalist Walt Whitman said of Booth's acting, "He would have flashes, passages, I thought of real genius."[43] The Philadelphia Press drama critic said, "Without having [his brother] Edwin's culture and grace, Mr. Booth has far more action, more life, and, we are inclined to think, more natural genius."[43] In October 1860, while performing in Columbus, Georgia, Booth was shot accidentally in his hotel, leaving a wound some thought would end his life.[44]When the Civil War began on April 12, 1861, Booth was starring in Albany, New York. He was outspoken in his admiration for the South's secession, publicly calling it "heroic." This so enraged local citizens that they demanded that he be banned from the stage for making "treasonable statements".[45] Albany's drama critics were kinder, giving him rave reviews. One called him a genius, praising his acting for "never fail[ing] to delight with his masterly impressions."[46] As the Civil War raged across the divided land in 1862, Booth appeared mostly in Union and border states. In January, he played the title role in Richard III in St. Louis and then made his Chicago debut. In March, he made his first acting appearance in New York City.[47] In May 1862, he made his Boston debut, playing nightly at the Boston Museum in Richard III (May 12, 15 and 23), Romeo and Juliet (May 13), The Robbers (May 14 and 21), Hamlet (May 16), The Apostate (May 19), The Stranger (May 20), and The Lady of Lyons (May 22). Following his performance of Richard III on May 12, the Boston Transcript's review the next day called Booth "the most promising young actor on the American stage".[48]Starting in January 1863, he returned to the Boston Museum for a series of plays, including the role of villain Duke Pescara in The Apostate, that won him acclaim from audiences and critics.[49] Back in Washington in April, he played the title roles in Hamlet and Richard III, one of his favorites. He was billed as "The Pride of the American People, A Star of the First Magnitude," and the critics were equally enthusiastic. The National Republican drama critic said that Booth "took the hearts of the audience by storm" and termed his performance "a complete triumph".[50][51] At the beginning of July 1863, Booth finished the acting season at Cleveland's Academy of Music, as the Battle of Gettysburg raged in Pennsylvania. Between September and November 1863, Booth played a hectic schedule in the northeast, appearing in Boston, Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut. Every day he received fan mail from infatuated women.[52]Family friend firstnameplaceholder T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth was one of the first leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart.[53][54] In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek sculptor in costume, making marble statues come to life.[54] Lincoln watched the play[55] from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you."[56] The President replied, "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?"[56] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose.[56] Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.[56]On November 25, 1864, Booth performed for the only time with his brothers Edwin and Junius in a single engagement production of Julius Caesar at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York.[57] He played Mark Antony and his brother Edwin had the larger role of Brutus in a performance acclaimed as "the greatest theatrical event in New York history."[56] The proceeds went towards a statue of William Shakespeare for Central Park, which still stands today (2019).[57][58] In January 1865, he acted in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in Washington, again garnering rave reviews. The National Intelligencer called Booth's Romeo "the most satisfactory of all renderings of that fine character," especially praising the death scene.[59] Booth made the final appearance of his acting career at Ford's on March 18, 1865, when he again played Duke Pescara in The Apostate.[60][61]
<h2>Business ventures</h2>
Booth invested some of his growing wealth in various enterprises during the early 1860s, including land speculation in Boston's Back Bay section.[62] He also started a business partnership with firstnameplaceholder A. Ellsler, manager of the Cleveland Academy of Music, and with Thomas Mears to develop oil wells in northwestern Pennsylvania, where an oil boom had started in August 1859, following Edwin Drake's discovery of oil there,[63] initially calling their venture Dramatic Oil but later renaming it Fuller Farm Oil. The partners invested in a 31.5-acre (12.7 ha) site along the Allegheny River at Franklin, Pennsylvania in late 1863 for drilling.[63] By early 1864, they had a producing 1,900-foot (579 m) deep oil well named Wilhelmina for Mears' wife, yielding 25 barrels (4 kL) of crude oil daily, then considered a good yield. The Fuller Farm Oil company was selling shares with a prospectus featuring the well-known actor's celebrity status as "Mr. J. secondnameplaceholder, a successful and intelligent operator in oil lands".[63] The partners were impatient to increase the well's output and attempted the use of explosives, which wrecked the well and ended production.Booth was already growing more obsessed with the South's worsening situation in the Civil War and angered at Lincoln's re-election. He withdrew from the oil business on November 27, 1864, with a substantial loss of his $6,000 investment ($81,400 in 2010 dollars).[63][64]
<h2>Civil War years</h2>
Booth was strongly opposed to the abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the United States. He attended the hanging of abolitionist leader firstnameplaceholder Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for treason, murder, and inciting a slave insurrection, charges resulting from his raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia).[65] Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he read in a newspaper about Brown's upcoming execution. So as to gain access that the public would not have, he donned a borrowed uniform of the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500 men traveling to Charles Town for Brown's hanging, to guard against a possible attempt to rescue Brown from the gallows by force.[65][66] When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate, although he admired the condemned man's bravery in facing death stoically.[43][67]Lincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently never delivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery.[68] On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth's native Maryland, some of the slaveholding portion of the population favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53–13) against secession on April 28, 1861,[69][70] it also voted not to allow federal troops to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland.[71] The legislature seems to have wanted to remain in the Union while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against Southern neighbors.[71] Adhering to Maryland's demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C., exposed, and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature's intention. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Baltimore and other portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Fort McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore.[72] Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in Ex parte Merryman, that Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus in Maryland was unconstitutional.[73]As a popular actor in the 1860s, Booth continued to travel extensively to perform in the North and South, and as far west as New Orleans. According to his sister Asia, Booth confided to her that he also used his position to smuggle the anti-malarial drug quinine, which was crucial to the lives of residents of the Gulf coast, to the South during his travels there, since it was in short supply due to the Northern blockade.[62]Booth was pro-Confederate, but his family was divided, like many Marylanders. He was outspoken in his love of the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred of Lincoln.[56][74] As the Civil War went on, Booth increasingly quarreled with his brother Edwin, who declined to make stage appearances in the South and refused to listen to firstnameplaceholder Wilkes' fiercely partisan denunciations of the North and Lincoln.[62] In early 1863, Booth was arrested in St. Louis while on a theatre tour, when he was heard saying that he "wished the President and the whole damned government would go to hell."[75][76] He was charged with making "treasonous" remarks against the government, but was released when he took an oath of allegiance to the Union and paid a substantial fine.Booth is alleged to have been a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret society whose initial objective was to acquire territories as slave states.[77]In February 1865, Booth became infatuated with Lucy Lambert Hale, the daughter of U.S. Senator firstnameplaceholder P. Hale of New Hampshire, and they became secretly engaged when Booth received his mother's blessing for their marriage plans. "You have so often been dead in love," his mother counseled Booth in a letter, "be well assured she is really and truly devoted to you."[78] Booth composed a handwritten Valentine card for his fiancée on February 13, expressing his "adoration". She was unaware of Booth's deep antipathy towards Lincoln.[78]As the 1864 presidential election drew near, the Confederacy's prospects for victory were ebbing, and the tide of war increasingly favored the North. The likelihood of Lincoln's re-election filled Booth with rage towards the President, whom Booth blamed for the war and all of the South's troubles. Booth had promised his mother at the outbreak of war that he would not enlist as a soldier, but he increasingly chafed at not fighting for the South, writing in a letter to her, "I have begun to deem myself a coward and to despise my own existence."[79] He began to formulate plans to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the Old Soldiers Home, three miles (4.8 km) from the White House, and to smuggle him across the Potomac River and into Richmond, Virginia. Once in Confederate hands, Lincoln would be exchanged for Confederate Army prisoners of war held in Northern prisons and, Booth reasoned, bring the war to an end by emboldening opposition to the war in the North or forcing Union recognition of the Confederate government.[79][80][81][82]Throughout the Civil War, the Confederacy maintained a network of underground operators in southern Maryland, particularly Charles and St. Mary's Counties, smuggling recruits across the Potomac River into Virginia and relaying messages for Confederate agents as far north as Canada.[83] Booth recruited his friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O'Laughlen as accomplices.[84] They met often at the house of Confederate sympathizer Maggie Branson at 16 North Eutaw Street in Baltimore.[29] He also met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at The Parker House in Boston.In October, Booth made an unexplained trip to Montreal, which was a center of clandestine Confederate activity. He spent ten days in the city, staying for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a rendezvous for the Confederate Secret Service, and meeting several Confederate agents there.[85][86] No conclusive proof has linked Booth's kidnapping or assassination plots to a conspiracy involving the leadership of the Confederate government, but historian David Herbert Donald states that "at least at the lower levels of the Southern secret service, the abduction of the Union President was under consideration."[87] Historian Thomas Goodrich concludes that Booth entered the Confederate Secret Service as a spy and courier.[88]Lincoln won a landslide re-election in early November 1864, on a platform that advocated abolishing slavery altogether, by Constitutional amendment.[89] Booth, meanwhile, devoted increased energy and money to his kidnapping plot.[90][91] He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including David Herold, George Atzerodt, Lewis Powell (also known as Lewis Payne or Paine), and rebel agent firstnameplaceholder Surratt.[83][92] They began to meet routinely at the boarding house of Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt.[92]By this time, firstnameplaceholder was arguing vehemently with his older, pro-Union brother Edwin about Lincoln and the war, and Edwin finally told him that he was no longer welcome at his New York home. Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister Asia. "That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes, and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds. He is made the tool of the North, to crush out slavery."[93] Asia recalled that he decried Lincoln's re-election, "making himself a king", and that he went on "wild tirades" in 1865, as the Confederacy's defeat became more certain.[94]Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4 as the guest of his secret fiancée Lucy Hale. In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There was no attempt to assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, Booth remarked about his "excellent chance...to kill the President, if I had wished."[79] On March 17, he learned that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play Still Waters Run Deep at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. He assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home in hope of kidnapping Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the President did not appear.[95] Booth later learned that Lincoln had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington — where Booth was staying.[79]
<h2>Assassination of Lincoln</h2>
On April 12, 1865, Booth heard the news that Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of firstnameplaceholder Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.[96]The previous day, Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. During the speech, Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting suffrage to the former slaves; infuriated, Booth declared that it would be the last speech that Lincoln would ever make.[95][97][98]On the morning of Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Booth went to Ford's Theatre to get his mail. While there, he was told by firstnameplaceholder Ford's brother that the President and Mrs. Lincoln would be attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre that evening, accompanied by Gen. and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant.[99] He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included making arrangements with livery stable owner James W. Pumphrey for a getaway horse and an escape route. Later that night, at 8:45 pm, Booth informed Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate Secretary of State William H. Seward and Atzerodt to do so to Vice President Andrew firstnameplaceholderson. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia.[100]Historian Michael W. Kauffman wrote that, by targeting Lincoln and his two immediate successors to the presidency, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion.[101] In 1865, however, the second presidential successor would have been the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, Lafayette S. Foster, rather than Secretary Seward.[102] The possibility of assassinating the Union Army's commanding general as well was foiled when Grant declined the theatre invitation at his wife's insistence. Instead, the Grants departed Washington by train that evening for a visit to relatives in New Jersey.[29] Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war if one Confederate army remained in the field or, that failing, would avenge the South's defeat.[103]Booth had free access to all parts of Ford's Theatre as a famous and popular actor who had frequently performed there and who was well known to its owner firstnameplaceholder T. Ford, even having his mail sent there.[104] Many believe that Booth had bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day, so that he could observe the box's occupants and verify that the President had made it to the play. Conversely, an April 1962 letter from Frank Ford, son of the theatre manager Harry Clay Ford, to George Olszewski, a National Park Service historian, includes: "Booth did not bore the hole in the door leading to the box [...]. The hole was bored by my father ... [to] allow the guard ... to look into the box".[105]After spending time at the saloon during intermission, Booth entered Ford's Theater one last time at 10:10 pm. In the theater, he slipped into Lincoln's box at around 10:14 p.m. as the play progressed and shot the President in the back of the head with a .41 caliber Deringer pistol.[106] Booth's escape was almost thwarted by Major Henry Rathbone, who was in the presidential box with Mary Todd Lincoln.[107] Booth stabbed Rathbone when the startled officer lunged at him.[83] Rathbone's fiancée Clara Harris was also in the box but was not harmed.Booth then jumped from the President's box to the stage, where he raised his knife and shouted "Sic semper tyrannis". (Latin for "Thus always to tyrants," attributed to Brutus at Caesar's assassination; state motto of Virginia and mentioned in the new "Maryland, My Maryland", future anthem of Booth's Maryland.) According to some accounts, Booth added, "I have done it, the South is avenged!"[36][108][109] Some witnesses reported that Booth fractured or otherwise injured his leg when his spur snagged a decorative U.S. Treasury Guard flag while leaping to the stage.[110] Historian Michael W. Kauffman questioned this legend in his book American Brutus: firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and the Lincoln Conspiracies, writing that eyewitness accounts of Booth's hurried stage exit made it unlikely that his leg was broken then. Kauffman contends that Booth was injured later that night during his flight to escape when his horse tripped and fell on him, calling Booth's claim to the contrary an exaggeration to portray his own actions as heroic.[111]Booth was the only one of the assassins to succeed. Powell was able to stab Seward, who was bedridden as a result of an earlier carriage accident; Seward was seriously wounded, but survived. Atzerodt lost his nerve and spent the evening drinking alcohol, never making an attempt to kill firstnameplaceholderson.
<h2>Reaction and pursuit</h2>
In the ensuing pandemonium inside Ford's Theatre, Booth fled by a stage door to the alley, where his getaway horse was held for him by Joseph "Peanuts" Burroughs.[112] The owner of the horse had warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and would break halter if left unattended. Booth left the horse with Edmund Spangler and Spangler arranged for Burroughs to hold it.The fleeing assassin galloped into southern Maryland, accompanied by David Herold, having planned his escape route to take advantage of the sparsely settled area's lack of telegraphs and railroads, along with its predominantly Confederate sympathies.[100][113] He thought that the area's dense forests and the swampy terrain of Zekiah Swamp made it ideal for an escape route into rural Virginia.[90][100][114] At midnight, Booth and Herold arrived at Surratt's Tavern on the Brandywine Pike, 9 miles (14 km) from Washington, where they had stored guns and equipment earlier in the year as part of the kidnap plot.[115]The fugitives then continued southward, stopping before dawn on April 15 for treatment of Booth's injured leg at the home of Dr. Samuel Mudd in St. Catharine, 25 miles (40 km) from Washington.[115] Mudd later said that Booth told him the injury occurred when his horse fell.[116] The next day, Booth and Herold arrived at the home of Samuel Cox around 4 am. As the two fugitives hid in the woods nearby, Cox contacted Thomas A. Jones, his foster brother and a Confederate agent in charge of spy operations in the southern Maryland area since 1862.[83][117] The War Department advertised a $100,000 reward ($1.69 million in 2021 USD) by order of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton for information leading to the arrest of Booth and his accomplices, and Federal troops were dispatched to search southern Maryland extensively, following tips reported by Federal intelligence agents to Col. Lafayette Baker.[118]Federal troops combed the rural area's woods and swamps for Booth in the days following the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room.[119] A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin's lower half.[120] Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol's lawn.[121] Prominent African-American abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an "unspeakable calamity".[122] Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an "accursed devil," "monster," "madman," and a "wretched fiend."[123] Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: "Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth card out of their albums: some threw it away, some burned it, some crumpled it angrily."[124] Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept.[125] Confederate general Joseph E. firstnameplaceholderston called Booth's act "a disgrace to the age".[126] Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln's death by Booth's hand.[122]Not all were grief-stricken. In New York City, a man was attacked by an enraged crowd when he shouted, "It served Old Abe right!" after hearing the news of Lincoln's death.[125] Elsewhere in the South, Lincoln was hated in death as in life, and Booth was viewed as a hero as many rejoiced at news of his deed.[122] Other Southerners feared that a vengeful North would exact a terrible retribution upon the defeated former Confederate states. "Instead of being a great Southern hero, his deed was considered the worst possible tragedy that could have befallen the South as well as the North," writes Kunhardt.[127]Booth lay in hiding in the Maryland woods, waiting for an opportunity to cross the Potomac River into Virginia. He read the accounts of national mourning reported in the newspapers brought to him by Jones each day.[127] By April 20, he was aware that some of his co-conspirators had already been arrested: Mary Surratt, Powell (or Paine), Arnold, and O'Laughlen.[128] Booth was surprised to find little public sympathy for his action, especially from those anti-Lincoln newspapers that had previously excoriated the President in life. News of the assassination reached the far corners of the nation, and indignation was aroused against Lincoln's critics, whom many blamed for encouraging Booth to act. The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized:Booth wrote of his dismay in a journal entry on April 21, as he awaited nightfall before crossing the Potomac River into Virginia (see map):That same day, the nine-car funeral train bearing Lincoln's body departed Washington on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, arriving at Baltimore's Camden Station at 10 am, the first stop on a 13-day journey to Springfield, Illinois, its final destination.[83][132][133] The funeral train slowly made its way westward through seven states, stopping en route at Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Trenton, New York, Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis during the following days. About 7 million people[134] lined the railroad tracks along the 1,662-mile (2,675 km) route, holding aloft signs with legends such as "We mourn our loss," "He lives in the hearts of his people," and "The darkest hour in history."[135][136]In the cities where the train stopped, 1.5 million people viewed Lincoln in his coffin.[122][133][135] Aboard the train was Chauncey Depew, a New York politician and later president of the New York Central Railroad, who said, "As we sped over the rails at night, the scene was the most pathetic ever witnessed. At every crossroads the glare of innumerable torches illuminated the whole population, kneeling on the ground."[133] Dorothy Kunhardt called the funeral train's journey "the mightiest outpouring of national grief the world had yet seen."[137]Mourners were viewing Lincoln's remains when the funeral train steamed into Harrisburg at 8:20 pm, while Booth and Herold were provided with a boat and compass by Jones to cross the Potomac at night on April 21.[83] Instead of reaching Virginia, they mistakenly navigated upriver to a bend in the broad Potomac River, coming ashore again in Maryland on April 22.[138] The 23-year-old Herold knew the area well, having frequently hunted there, and recognized a nearby farm as belonging to a Confederate sympathizer. The farmer led them to his son-in-law, Col. firstnameplaceholder J. Hughes, who provided the fugitives with food and a hideout until nightfall, for a second attempt to row across the river to Virginia.[139] Booth wrote in his diary:The pair finally reached the Virginia shore near Machodoc Creek before dawn on April 23.[140] There, they made contact with Thomas Harbin, whom Booth had previously brought into his erstwhile kidnapping plot. Harbin took Booth and Herold to another Confederate agent in the area named William Bryant who supplied them with horses.[139][141]While Lincoln's funeral train was in New York City on April 24, Lieutenant Edward P. Doherty was dispatched from Washington at 2 p.m. with a detachment of 26 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment to capture Booth in Virginia,[142] accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Everton Conger, an intelligence officer assigned by Lafayette Baker. The detachment steamed 70 miles (113 km) down the Potomac River on the boat firstnameplaceholder S. Ide, landing at Belle Plain, Virginia, at 10 pm.[142][143] The pursuers crossed the Rappahannock River and tracked Booth and Herold to Richard H. Garrett's farm, about 2 miles (3 km) south of Port Royal, Virginia. Booth and Herold had been led to the farm on April 24 by William S. Jett, a former private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry, whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock.[138] The Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination; Booth was introduced to them as "James W. Boyd", a Confederate soldier, they were told, who had been wounded in the battle of Petersburg and was returning home.[144]Garrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, he became a Baptist minister and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm.[144] In 1921, Garrett's lecture was published in the Confederate Veteran as the "True Story of the Capture of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder."[145] According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3 p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased with the collapse of the Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination.[145] After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of firstnameplaceholderston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination had failed.[146] The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs.[145] Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, "Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him."[147]
<h2>Death</h2>
Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Before dawn on April 26, the soldiers caught up with the fugitives, who were hiding in Garrett's tobacco barn. David Herold surrendered, but Booth refused Conger's demand to surrender, saying, "I prefer to come out and fight." The soldiers then set the barn on fire.[148][149] As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him. According to Corbett's later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive "raised his pistol to shoot" at them.[149] Conger's report to Stanton stated that Corbett shot Booth "without order, pretext or excuse," and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive.[149] Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged from the barn to the porch of Garrett's farmhouse, where he died three hours later, aged 26.[144] The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him.[21][148] In his dying moments, he reportedly whispered, "Tell my mother I died for my country."[144][148] Asking that his hands be raised to his face so that he could see them, Booth uttered his last words, "Useless, useless," and died as dawn was breaking of asphyxiation as a result of his wounds.[148][150] In Booth's pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women (actresses Alice Grey, Helen Western, Effie Germon, Fannie Brown, and Booth's fiancée Lucy Hale), and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln's death, "Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment."[151]Shortly after Booth's death, his brother Edwin wrote to his sister Asia, "Think no more of him as your brother; he is dead to us now, as he soon must be to all the world, but imagine the boy you loved to be in that better part of his spirit, in another world."[152] Asia also had in her possession a sealed letter that Booth had given her in January 1865 for safekeeping, only to be opened upon his death.[153] In the letter, Booth had written:Booth's letter was seized by Federal troops, along with other family papers at Asia's house, and published by The New York Times while the manhunt was still underway. It explained his reasons for plotting against Lincoln. In it he decried Lincoln's war policy as one of "total annihilation", and said:
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
Booth's body was shrouded in a blanket and tied to the side of an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain.[154] There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him.[155] Among the identifying features used to make sure that the man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.[156]
The third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae were removed during the autopsy to allow access to the bullet. These bones are still on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C.[157] The body was then buried in a storage room at the Old Penitentiary, later moved to a warehouse at the Washington Arsenal on October 1, 1867.[158] In 1869, the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family, where they were buried in the family plot at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, after a burial ceremony conducted by Fleming James, minister of Christ Episcopal Church, in the presence of more than 40 people.[158][159][160][161] Russell Conwell visited homes in the vanquished former Confederate states during this time, and he found that hatred of Lincoln still smoldered. "Photographs of secondnameplaceholder, with the last words of great martyrs printed upon its borders...adorn their drawing rooms".[122]Eight others implicated in Lincoln's assassination were tried by a military tribunal in Washington, D.C., and found guilty on June 30, 1865.[162] Mary Surratt,[163] Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7, 1865.[164] Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life imprisonment at Fort Jefferson in Florida's isolated Dry Tortugas. Edmund Spangler was given a six-year term in prison.[78] O'Laughlen died in a yellow fever epidemic there in 1867. The others were eventually pardoned in February 1869 by President Andrew firstnameplaceholderson.[165]Forty years later, when the centenary of Lincoln's birth was celebrated in 1909, a border state official reflected on Booth's assassination of Lincoln: "Confederate veterans held public services and gave public expression to the sentiment, that 'had Lincoln lived' the days of Reconstruction might have been softened and the era of good feeling ushered in earlier."[122] The majority of Northerners viewed Booth as a madman or monster who murdered the savior of the Union, while in the South, many cursed Booth for bringing upon them the harsh revenge of an incensed North instead of the reconciliation promised by Lincoln.[166] A century later, Goodrich concluded in 2005, "For millions of people, particularly in the South, it would be decades before the impact of the Lincoln assassination began to release its terrible hold on their lives".[167]Author Francis Wilson was 11 years old at the time of Lincoln's assassination. He wrote an epitaph of Booth in his 1929 book firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: "In the terrible deed he committed, he was actuated by no thought of monetary gain, but by a self-sacrificing, albeit wholly fanatical devotion to a cause he thought supreme."[168] Others have seen more selfish motives, such as shame, ambition, and sibling rivalry for achievement and fame.[9]In 1907, Finis L. Bates wrote Escape and Suicide of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, contending that a Booth look-alike was mistakenly killed at the Garrett farm while Booth eluded his pursuers.[169] Booth, said Bates, assumed the pseudonym "firstnameplaceholder St. Helen" and settled on the Paluxy River near Glen Rose, Texas, and later moved to Granbury, Texas. He fell gravely ill and made a deathbed confession that he was the fugitive assassin, but he then recovered and fled, eventually committing suicide in 1903 in Enid, Oklahoma, under the alias "David E. George".[11][169][170] By 1913, more than 70,000 copies of the book had been sold, and Bates exhibited St. Helen's mummified body in carnival sideshows.[11]In response, the Maryland Historical Society published an account in 1913 by Baltimore mayor William M. Pegram, who had viewed Booth's remains upon the casket's arrival at the Weaver funeral home in Baltimore on February 18, 1869, for burial at Green Mount Cemetery. Pegram had known Booth well as a young man; he submitted a sworn statement that the body which he had seen in 1869 was Booth's.[171] Others positively identified this body as Booth at the funeral home, including Booth's mother, brother, and sister, along with his dentist and other Baltimore acquaintances.[11] In 1911, The New York Times had published an account by their reporter detailing the burial of Booth's body at the cemetery and those who were witnesses.[159] The rumor periodically revived, as in the 1920s when a corpse was exhibited on a national tour by a carnival promoter and advertised as the "Man Who Shot Lincoln". According to a 1938 article in the Saturday Evening Post, the exhibitor said that he obtained St. Helen's corpse from Bates' widow.[172]The Lincoln Conspiracy (1977) contended that there was a government plot to conceal Booth's escape, reviving interest in the story and prompting the display of St. Helen's mummified body in Chicago that year.[173] The book sold more than one million copies and was made into a feature film called The Lincoln Conspiracy which was theatrically released later that year.[174] The 1998 book The Curse of Cain: The Untold Story of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder contended that Booth had escaped, sought refuge in Japan, and eventually returned to the United States.[175] In 1994 two historians together with several descendants sought a court order for the exhumation of Booth's body at Green Mount Cemetery which was, according to their lawyer, "intended to prove or disprove longstanding theories on Booth's escape" by conducting a photo-superimposition analysis.[176][177] The application was blocked by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan, who cited, among other things, "the unreliability of petitioners' less-than-convincing escape/cover-up theory" as a major factor in his decision. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the ruling.[156][178]In December 2010, descendants of Edwin Booth reported that they obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor's body to obtain DNA samples to compare with a sample of his brother firstnameplaceholder's DNA to refute the rumor that firstnameplaceholder had escaped after the assassination. Bree Harvey, a spokesman from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Edwin Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin's body.[179] The family hoped to obtain samples of firstnameplaceholder Wilkes's DNA from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland.[180] On March 30, 2013, museum spokeswoman Carol firstnameplaceholderson announced that the family's request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.[181]

firstnameplaceholder Herbert secondnameplaceholder (June 22, 1903 – July 22, 1934) was an American gangster of the Great Depression. He led a group known as the "secondnameplaceholder Gang", which was accused of robbing 24 banks and four police stations. secondnameplaceholder was imprisoned several times but escaped twice. He was charged, but not convicted, of the murder of an East Chicago, Indiana, police officer who shot secondnameplaceholder in his bullet-proof vest during a shootout; it was the only time secondnameplaceholder was charged with homicide.secondnameplaceholder courted publicity. The media ran exaggerated accounts of his bravado and colorful personality and cast him as a Robin Hood.[1][2][3] In response, J. Edgar Hoover, then director of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI), used secondnameplaceholder and his gang as his campaign platform to evolve the BOI into the Federal Bureau of Investigation, developing more sophisticated investigative techniques as weapons against organized crime.[1]After evading police in four states for almost a year, secondnameplaceholder was wounded and went to his father's home to mend. He returned to Chicago in July 1934 and sought refuge in a brothel owned by Ana Cumpănaș. She informed authorities of his whereabouts. On July 22, 1934, local and federal law enforcement closed in on the Biograph Theater.[4] As BOI agents moved to arrest secondnameplaceholder as he exited the theater, he drew a gun while attempting to flee, but was killed; this was later ruled as justifiable homicide.[5][6]
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on June 22, 1903 at 2053 Cooper Street (now Caroline Avenue), Indianapolis, Indiana,[7] the younger of two children born to firstnameplaceholder Wilson secondnameplaceholder (1864–1943) and Mary Ellen "Mollie" Lancaster (1870–1907).[8]:10According to some biographers, his German grandfather, Matthias secondnameplaceholder, immigrated to the United States in 1851 from Metz, in the region of Lorraine, then still under French sovereignty.[9] Matthias secondnameplaceholder was born in Gisingen, near Dillingen in the present-day German state of Saarland. firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's parents had married on August 23, 1887. secondnameplaceholder's father was a grocer by trade and, reportedly, a harsh man.[8]:9 In an interview with reporters, secondnameplaceholder said that he was firm in his discipline and believed in the adage "spare the rod and spoil the child".[8]:12secondnameplaceholder's older sister, Audrey, was born March 6, 1889. Their mother died in 1907 just before his fourth birthday.[8][10]
Audrey married Emmett "Fred" Hancock that year and they had seven children together. She cared for her brother firstnameplaceholder for several years until their father remarried in 1912 to Elizabeth "Lizzie" Fields (1878–1933). They had three children, Hubert M. secondnameplaceholder (1913–1974) Doris M. secondnameplaceholder Hockman (1918–2001) and Frances secondnameplaceholder Thompson (1922–2015).[10][11]As a teenager, secondnameplaceholder was frequently in trouble with the law for fighting and petty theft; he was also noted for his "bewildering personality" and bullying of smaller children.[8]:14 He quit school to work in an Indianapolis machine shop. His father feared that the city was corrupting his son, prompting him to move the family to Mooresville, Indiana, in 1921.[8]:15 secondnameplaceholder's wild and rebellious behaviour was unchanged, despite his new rural life. In 1922, he was arrested for auto theft, and his relationship with his father deteriorated.[8]:16–17In 1923, secondnameplaceholder's troubles led to him enlisting in the United States Navy, where he was a Petty officer third class Machinery Repairman assigned aboard the battleship USS Utah,[12] but he deserted a few months later when his ship was docked in Boston. He was eventually dishonorably discharged some months later.[8]:18–20secondnameplaceholder then returned to Mooresville where he met Beryl Ethel Hovious.[13] The two married on April 12, 1924. He attempted to settle down, but he had difficulty holding a job and preserving his marriage.[1] Unable to find a job, he began planning a robbery with his friend Ed Singleton,[8]:22 who was an ex-convict and umpire for a semi-professional baseball team, the AC Athletics, for which secondnameplaceholder played shortstop.[14] The two robbed a local grocery store, stealing $50.[8]:26 While leaving the scene, the criminals were spotted by a minister who recognized the men and reported them to the police. During the robbery, secondnameplaceholder had struck a victim on the head with a machine bolt wrapped in a cloth and had also carried a gun which, although it discharged, hit no one. The two men were arrested the next day. Singleton pleaded not guilty, but after secondnameplaceholder's father (the local Mooresville Church deacon) discussed the matter with Morgan County prosecutor Omar O'Harrow, his father convinced secondnameplaceholder to confess to the crime and plead guilty without retaining a defence attorney.[8]:24secondnameplaceholder was convicted of assault and battery with intent to rob, and conspiracy to commit a felony. He expected a lenient probation sentence as a result of his father's discussion with O'Harrow but instead was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison for his crimes.[10] His father told reporters he regretted his advice and was appalled by the sentence. He pleaded with the judge to shorten the sentence, but with no success.[8]:25 En route to Mooresville to testify against Singleton, secondnameplaceholder briefly escaped his captors but was apprehended within a few minutes.[8]:27 Singleton had a change of venue and was sentenced to a jail term of 2 to 14 years. He died September 2, 1937 from fatal gunshot wounds. [15]
<h2>Prison time</h2>
Incarcerated at Indiana Reformatory and Indiana State Prison from 1924 to 1933, secondnameplaceholder began to become embroiled in a criminal lifestyle. Upon being admitted to prison, he was quoted as saying, "I will be the meanest bastard you ever saw when I get out of here."[8]:26 His physical examination at the prison showed that he had gonorrhea, and the treatment for the condition was, apparently, extremely painful.[8]:22 He became embittered against society because of his long prison sentence and befriended other criminals, including seasoned bank robbers Harry "Pete" Pierpont, Charles Makley, Russell Clark, and Homer Van Meter, who taught secondnameplaceholder how to be a successful criminal. The men planned heists that they would commit soon after they were released.[8]:32 secondnameplaceholder also studied Herman Lamm's meticulous bank-robbing system and used it extensively throughout his criminal career.[16]secondnameplaceholder's father launched a campaign to have him released and was able to obtain 188 signatures on a petition. On May 10, 1933, after serving nine and a half years, secondnameplaceholder was paroled. Just before he was released from the prison his stepmother became sick, and she died before he arrived at her home.[8]:37 Released at the height of the Great Depression, secondnameplaceholder had little prospect of finding gainful employment.[8]:35 He immediately returned to crime.[8]:39On June 21, 1933, he robbed his first bank, taking $10,000 from the New Carlisle National Bank, which occupied the building at the southeast corner of Main Street and Jefferson (State Routes 235 and 571) in New Carlisle, Ohio.[17] On August 14, secondnameplaceholder robbed a bank in Bluffton, Ohio. Tracked by police from Dayton, Ohio, he was captured and later transferred to the Allen County Jail in Lima to be indicted in connection to the Bluffton robbery. After searching him before letting him into the prison, the police discovered a document which appeared to be a prison escape plan. They demanded secondnameplaceholder tell them what the document meant, but he refused.[10]Earlier, while in prison, secondnameplaceholder had helped conceive a plan to enable the escape of Pete Pierpont, Russell Clark, and six others he had met while in prison, most of whom worked in the prison laundry. secondnameplaceholder had friends smuggle guns into their cells which they used to escape four days after secondnameplaceholder's capture. The group that formed up, known as "the First secondnameplaceholder Gang,” consisted of Pierpont, Clark, Charles Makley, Ed Shouse, Harry Copeland, and firstnameplaceholder "Red" Hamilton, a member of the Herman Lamm Gang. Pierpont, Clark, and Makley arrived in Lima on October 12, 1933, where they impersonated Indiana State Police officers, claiming they had come to extradite secondnameplaceholder to Indiana. When the sheriff, Jess Sarber, asked for their credentials, Pierpont shot Sarber dead, then released secondnameplaceholder from his cell. The four men escaped back to Indiana, where they joined the rest of the gang.[10]
<h2>Bank robberies</h2>
secondnameplaceholder is known to have participated with the secondnameplaceholder Gang in 12 separate bank robberies, between June 21, 1933, and June 30, 1934.[18]
<h2>Evelyn Frechette</h2>
Evelyn "Billie" Frechette met firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in October 1933, and they began a relationship on November 20. After secondnameplaceholder's death, Billie was offered money for her story and wrote a memoir for the Chicago Herald and Examiner in August 1934.[19]
<h2>Escape from Crown Point, Indiana</h2>
On January 25, 1934, secondnameplaceholder and his gang were captured in Tucson, Arizona.[20][21] He was extradited to Indiana and escorted back by Matt Leach,[22] the chief of the Indiana State Police. secondnameplaceholder was taken to the Lake County Jail in Crown Point, Indiana and imprisoned to face charges for the murder of a policeman who was killed during a secondnameplaceholder gang bank robbery in East Chicago, Indiana, on January 15, 1934. The local police boasted to area newspapers that the jail was escape-proof and had even posted extra guards as a precaution. However, at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 3, 1934, secondnameplaceholder was able to escape. During morning exercises at the jail with 15 other immates, secondnameplaceholder produced a pistol, catching deputies and guards by surprise, and he was able to leave the premises without firing a shot. Almost immediately afterwards conjecture began whether the gun secondnameplaceholder displayed was real or not. According to Deputy Ernest Blunk, secondnameplaceholder had escaped using a real pistol. FBI files, on the other hand, indicate that secondnameplaceholder used a carved fake pistol. Sam Cahoon, a trustee who secondnameplaceholder took hostage in the jail, also believed secondnameplaceholder had carved the gun, using a razor and some shelving in his cell. In another version, according to an unpublished interview with secondnameplaceholder's attorney, Louis Piquett, investigator Art O'Leary claimed to have snuck the gun in himself.[23]On March 16, Herbert Youngblood, who escaped from Crown Point alongside secondnameplaceholder, was shot dead by three police officers in Port Huron, Michigan. Deputy Sheriff Charles Cavanaugh was mortally wounded in the battle and died a few hours later. Before he died, Youngblood told the officers that secondnameplaceholder was in the neighborhood of Port Huron, and immediately officers began a search for the escaped man, but no trace of him was found. An Indiana newspaper reported that Youngblood later retracted the story and said he did not know where secondnameplaceholder was at that time, as he had parted with him soon after their escape.[24]secondnameplaceholder was indicted by a local grand jury, and the Bureau of Investigation (a precursor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation)[4] organized a nationwide manhunt for him.[25] Just hours after his escape from the Crown Point jail, secondnameplaceholder reunited with his girlfriend, Evelyn "Billie" Frechette, at her half-sister Patsy's Chicago apartment at 3512 North Halsted, where she was also staying.[citation needed]According to Frechette's trial testimony, secondnameplaceholder stayed with her there for "almost two weeks." However, the two had actually traveled to the Twin Cities and taken lodgings at the Santa Monica Apartments (Unit 106) at 3252 Girard Avenue South, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where they stayed for 15 days, from March 4 to March 19, 1934.[26][27] secondnameplaceholder then met up with firstnameplaceholder "Red" Hamilton (who had been recovering for the past month from his gunshot wounds in the East Chicago robbery), and the two mustered up a new gang consisting of themselves and Baby Face Nelson's gang, including Nelson, Homer Van Meter, Tommy Carroll and Eddie Green.Three days after secondnameplaceholder's escape from Crown Point, the second Gang robbed a bank in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A week later they robbed First National Bank in Mason City, Iowa.[28]
<h2>Lincoln Court Apartments shootout</h2>
On Tuesday, March 20, 1934, secondnameplaceholder and Frechette moved into apartment 303 of the Lincoln Court Apartments, 93–95 South Lexington Avenue (now Lexington Parkway South) in St. Paul, Minnesota, using the aliases "Mr. & Mrs. Carl T. Hellman." The three-story apartment complex[29] had 32 apartments — 10 units on each floor, plus two basement units.[30][31]Daisy Coffey, the landlord/owner, would later testify at Frechette's trial that she spent most evenings during secondnameplaceholder's stay furnishing apartment 310, which enabled her to observe what was happening in apartment 303 directly across the courtyard. On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments.As a result of Coffey's tip, the building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they saw nothing unusual, mainly because the blinds were drawn.[32] The next morning at approximately 10:15 a.m., Nalls circled around the block looking for the Hudson, but observed nothing. He parked, first on Lincoln Avenue (the north side of the apartments), then on the west side of Lexington Avenue, at the northwest corner of Lexington and Lincoln, and remained in his car while watching Coulter and St. Paul Police detective Henry Cummings, pull up, park, and enter the building.[33] Ten minutes later, by Nalls's estimate, Van Meter parked a green Ford coupe on the north side of the apartment building.[34]Meanwhile, Coulter and Cummings knocked on the door of apartment 303. Frechette answered, opening the door two to three inches. She said she was not dressed and to come back. Coulter told her they would wait. After waiting two to three minutes, Coulter went to the basement apartment of the caretakers, Louis and Margaret Meidlinger, and asked to use the phone to call the bureau. He quickly returned to Cummings, and the two of them waited for Frechette to open the door. Van Meter then appeared in the hall and asked Coulter if his name was firstnameplaceholderson. Coulter said it was not, and as Van Meter passed on to the landing of the third floor, Coulter asked him for a name. Van Meter replied, "I am a soap salesman." Asked where his samples were, Van Meter said they were in his car. Coulter asked if he had any credentials. Van Meter said "no", and continued down the stairs. Coulter waited 10 to 20 seconds, then followed Van Meter. As Coulter got to the lobby on the ground floor, Van Meter opened fire on him.[35] Coulter hastily fled outside, chased by Van Meter. Van Meter ran back into the front entrance.Recognizing Van Meter, Nalls pointed out the Ford to Coulter and told him to disable it. Coulter shot out the rear left tire. While Coulter stayed with Van Meter's Ford, Nalls went to the corner drugstore and called the local police, then the bureau's St. Paul office, but could not get through because both lines were busy.[36][37] Van Meter, meanwhile, escaped by hopping on a passing coal truck.[38]Frechette, in her harboring trial testimony, said that she told secondnameplaceholder that the police had showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, secondnameplaceholder opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. secondnameplaceholder then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit secondnameplaceholder in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated down the stairs to the front entrance.[39] Once Cummings retreated, secondnameplaceholder and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.[citation needed]After the shootout, secondnameplaceholder and Frechette drove to Eddie Green's apartment in Minneapolis. Green called his associate Dr. Clayton E. May at his office at 712 Masonic Temple in downtown Minneapolis (still extant). With Green, his wife Beth, and Frechette following in Green's car, the doctor drove secondnameplaceholder to an apartment belonging to Augusta Salt, who had been providing nursing services and a bed for May's illicit patients for several years, patients he could not risk seeing at his regular office. May treated secondnameplaceholder's wound with antiseptics. Green visited secondnameplaceholder on Monday, April 2, just hours before Green would be mortally wounded by the FBI in St. Paul. secondnameplaceholder convalesced at Dr. May's for five days, until Wednesday, April 4. Dr. May was promised $500 for his services, but received nothing.[40][41]
<h2>Return to Mooresville</h2>
After the events in Minneapolis, secondnameplaceholder and Frechette traveled to Mooresville to visit secondnameplaceholder's father. Friday, April 6, 1934 was spent contacting family members, particularly his half-brother Hubert secondnameplaceholder. On April 6, Hubert and secondnameplaceholder left Mooresville at about 8:00 p.m. and proceeded to Leipsic, Ohio (approximately 210 miles away), to see Joseph and Lena Pierpont, parents of Prohibition Era gangster, Harry Pierpont. The Pierponts were not home, so the two headed back to Mooresville around midnight.[42]On April 7 at approximately 3:30 a.m., they rammed a car driven by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Manning near Noblesville, Indiana, after Hubert fell asleep behind the wheel. They crashed through a farm fence and about 200 feet into the woods. Both men made it back to the Mooresville farm. Swarms of police showed up at the accident scene within hours. Found in the car were maps, a machine gun magazine, a length of rope, and a bullwhip. According to Hubert, his brother planned to pay a visit with the bullwhip to his former one-armed "shyster" lawyer at Crown Point, Joseph Ryan, who had run off with his retainer after being replaced by Louis Piquett. At about 10:30 a.m. on April 7, Billie, Hubert and Hubert's wife purchased a black four-door Ford V8, registering it in the name of Mrs. Fred Penfield (Billie Frechette). At 2:30 p.m., Billie and Hubert picked up the V8 and returned to Mooresville.[citation needed]On Sunday, April 8, the secondnameplaceholders enjoyed a family picnic while the FBI had the farm under surveillance nearby.[42]  Later in the afternoon, suspecting they were being watched (agents J. L. Geraghty and T. J. Donegan were cruising in the vicinity in their car), the group left in separate cars. Billie drove the new Ford V8, with two of secondnameplaceholder's nieces, Mary Hancock in the front seat and Alberta Hancock in the back. secondnameplaceholder was on the floor of the car. He was later seen, but not recognized, by Donegan and Geraghty. Eventually, Norman, driving the V8, proceeded with secondnameplaceholder and Billie to Chicago, where they separated from Norman.[42]The following afternoon, Monday, April 9, secondnameplaceholder had an appointment at a tavern at 416 North State Street. Sensing trouble, Billie went in first. She was promptly arrested by agents, but refused to reveal secondnameplaceholder's whereabouts. secondnameplaceholder was waiting in his car outside the tavern and then drove off unnoticed.[43] The two would never see each other again.[citation needed]secondnameplaceholder reportedly became despondent after Billie was arrested. The other gang members tried to talk him out of rescuing her, but Van Meter encouraged him by saying that he knew where they could find bulletproof vests. That Friday morning, late at night, secondnameplaceholder and Van Meter took a hostage, Warsaw, Indiana police officer Judd Pittenger. They marched Pittenger at gunpoint into the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests. After separating, secondnameplaceholder picked up Hamilton, who was recovering from the Mason City robbery. The two then traveled to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where they visited Hamilton's sister Anna Steve.[citation needed]
<h2>Escape at Little Bohemia</h2>
The Bureau, or Division, of Investigations - precursor to federal jurisdiction and 1935 name change to FBI -[44][45] received a call Sunday morning, April 22 that firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and several of his confederates were hiding out at a small vacation lodge called Little Bohemia near present-day Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin.Special Agent in Charge Purvis and several BOI agents approached the lodge when three men exited the building and began to drive off. Agents yelled for the car to stop, but the men had been drinking and did not hear the agents. Agents opened up fire on the car and the driver was killed.secondnameplaceholder and some of the gang were upstairs in the lodge and began shooting out the windows. While the BOI agents ducked for cover, secondnameplaceholder and his men got out the back of the lodge toward the lake and were able to get out of the area very quietly.[46]
<h2>Hiding in Chicago</h2>
By July 1934, secondnameplaceholder had dropped completely out of sight, and the federal agents had no solid leads to follow. He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to secondnameplaceholder. Working as a clerk, secondnameplaceholder found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, he was able to lead an anonymous existence for a while. What he did not realize was that the center of the federal agents' dragnet happened to be Chicago. When the authorities found secondnameplaceholder's blood-spattered getaway car on a Chicago side street, they were positive that he was in the city.[10]secondnameplaceholder had always been a fan of the Chicago Cubs, and attended Cubs games at Wrigley Field during June and July.[47] He is known to have been at Wrigley on Friday, June 8, only to watch the Cubs lose to Cincinnati 4–3. Also in attendance at the game were secondnameplaceholder's lawyer, Louis Piquett, and Captain firstnameplaceholder Stege of the secondnameplaceholder Squad.[42][48]
<h2>Plastic surgery</h2>
According to Art O'Leary, as early as March 1934, secondnameplaceholder expressed an interest in plastic surgery and had asked O'Leary to check with Piquett on such matters. At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett's help.[citation needed] He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on the tips of his fingers by the application of a caustic soda preparation. Piquett said secondnameplaceholder would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O'Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would take place at the home of Piquett's longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.[citation needed]On May 28, Loeser was picked up at his home at 7:30 p.m. by O'Leary and Cassidy. The three of them then drove to Probasco's place. secondnameplaceholder chose to have a general anaesthetic. Loeser later testified:Cassidy administered an overdose of ether, which caused secondnameplaceholder to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled secondnameplaceholder's tongue out of his mouth with a pair of forceps, and at the same time forcing both elbows into his ribs. secondnameplaceholder gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on secondnameplaceholder's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.[citation needed]Loeser met with Piquett again on Saturday, June 2, with Piquett saying that more work was needed on secondnameplaceholder and that Van Meter now wanted the same work done to him. Also, both now wanted work done on their fingertips. The price for the fingerprint procedure would be $500 per hand or $100 a finger. Loeser used a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid—commonly known as aqua regia.[50][page needed]Loeser met O'Leary the following night at Clark and Wright at 8:30, and they once again drove to Probasco's. Present this evening were secondnameplaceholder, Van Meter, Probasco, Piquett, Cassidy, and Peggy Doyle, Probasco's girlfriend. Loeser testified that he worked for only about 30 minutes before O'Leary and Piquett had left.Loeser testified:Minor work was done two nights later, Tuesday, June 5. Loeser made some small corrections first on Van Meter, then secondnameplaceholder. Loeser stated:Peggy Doyle later told agents:O'Leary stated that secondnameplaceholder expressed dissatisfaction with the facial work that Loeser had performed on him. O'Leary said that, on another occasion, "that Probasco told him, 'the son of a bitch has gone out for one of his walks'; that he did not know when he would return; that Probasco raved about the craziness of secondnameplaceholder, stating that he was always going for walks and was likely to cause the authorities to locate the place where he was staying; that Probasco stated frankly on this occasion that he was afraid to have the man around."[citation needed]Agents arrested Loeser at 1127 South Harvey, Oak Park, Illinois, on Tuesday, July 24. O'Leary returned from a family fishing trip on July 24, the day of Loeser's arrest, and had read in the newspapers that the Department of Justice was looking for two doctors and another man in connection with some plastic work that was done on secondnameplaceholder. O'Leary left Chicago immediately, but returned two weeks later, learned that Loeser and others had been arrested, phoned Piquett, who assured him everything was all right, then left again. He returned from St. Louis on August 25 and was promptly taken into custody.[53]On Friday, July 27, Probasco fell to his death from the 19th floor of the Bankers' Building in Chicago while in custody. On Thursday, August 23, Homer Van Meter was shot and killed in a dead-end alley in St. Paul by Tom Brown, former St. Paul Chief of Police, and then-current chief Frank Cullen.[citation needed]
<h2>Polly Hamilton</h2>
Rita "Polly" Hamilton was a teenage runaway from Fargo, North Dakota.[8] She met Ana Ivanova Akalieva (Ana Cumpănaș; a.k.a. Ana Sage) in Gary, Indiana, and worked periodically as a prostitute in Ana's brothel until marrying Gary police officer Roy O. Keele in 1929. They divorced in March 1933.[8]In the summer of 1934, the now 26-year-old[1] Hamilton was a waitress in Chicago at the S&S Sandwich Shop located at 1209½ Wilson Avenue. She had remained friends with Sage and was sharing living space with Sage and Sage's 24-year-old son, Steve, at 2858 Clark Street.[8]secondnameplaceholder and Hamilton, a Billie Frechette look-a-like,[1][8] met in June 1934 at the Barrel of Fun night club located at 4541 Wilson Avenue. secondnameplaceholder introduced himself as Jimmy Lawrence and said he was a clerk at the Board of Trade. They dated until secondnameplaceholder's death at the Biograph Theater in July 1934.[1][8]
<h2>Betrayal</h2>
Division of Investigations chief J. Edgar Hoover created a special task force headquartered in Chicago to locate secondnameplaceholder. On July 21, Ana Cumpănaș, a madam from a brothel in Gary, Indiana, also known as "The Woman in Red" contacted the FBI. She was a Romanian immigrant threatened with deportation for "low moral character"[54] and offered agents information on secondnameplaceholder in exchange for their help in preventing her deportation. The FBI agreed to her terms, but she was later deported nonetheless. Cumpănaș revealed that secondnameplaceholder was spending his time with another prostitute, Polly Hamilton, and that she and the couple were going to see a movie together on the following day. She agreed to wear an orange dress,[55] so police could easily identify her. She was unsure which of two theaters they would attend, the Biograph or the Marbro.[10]On December 15, 1934, pardons were issued by Indiana Governor Harry G. Leslie for the offenses of which Ana Cumpănaș was convicted.[56]Cumpănaș stated that on Sunday afternoon, July 22, secondnameplaceholder asked her whether she wanted to go to the show with them (Polly and him).A team of federal agents and officers from police forces from outside of Chicago was formed, along with a very small number of Chicago police officers. Among them was Sergeant Martin Zarkovich, the officer to whom Cumpănaș had acted as an informant. At the time, federal officials felt that the Chicago police had been compromised and therefore could not be trusted; Hoover and Purvis also wanted more of the credit.[55] Not wanting to take the risk of another embarrassing escape of secondnameplaceholder, the police were split into two groups. On Sunday, one team was sent to the Marbro Theater on the city's west side, while another team surrounded the Biograph Theater at 2433 N. Lincoln Avenue on the north side.[10]
<h2>Shooting at the Biograph Theater and death</h2>
At approximately 8:30 p.m., Sage, Hamilton, and secondnameplaceholder were observed entering the Biograph Theater,[6][56][58] which was showing the crime drama Manhattan Melodrama, starring Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, and William Powell. During the stakeout, the Biograph's manager thought the agents were criminals setting up a robbery. He called the Chicago police, who dutifully responded and had to be waved off by the federal agents, who told them that they were on a stakeout for an important target.[10]When the film ended, Purvis[59] stood by the front door and signaled secondnameplaceholder's exit by lighting a cigar. Both he and the other agents reported that secondnameplaceholder turned his head and looked directly at the agent as he walked by, glanced across the street, then moved ahead of his female companions, reached into his pocket but failed to extract his gun,[8]:353 and ran into a nearby alley.[55] Other accounts stated secondnameplaceholder ignored a command to surrender, whipped out his gun, then headed for the alley. Agents already had the alley closed off.[60]Three men pursued secondnameplaceholder into the alley and fired. Clarence Hurt shot twice, Charles Winstead three times, and Herman Hollis once. secondnameplaceholder was hit from behind and fell face first to the ground.[61]secondnameplaceholder was struck four times, with two bullets grazing him and one causing a superficial wound to the right side. The fatal bullet entered through the back of his neck, severed the spinal cord, passed into his brain and exited just under the right eye, severing two sets of veins and arteries.[5] An ambulance was summoned, although it was soon apparent secondnameplaceholder had died from the gunshot wounds; he was officially pronounced dead at Alexian Brothers Hospital.[10][61] According to investigators, secondnameplaceholder died without saying a word.[62] Winstead was later thought to have fired the fatal shot, and as a consequence received a personal letter of commendation[specify] from J. Edgar Hoover.[55]Two female bystanders, Theresa Paulas and Etta Natalsky, were wounded. secondnameplaceholder bumped into Natalsky just as the shooting started.[42][55] Natalsky was shot and was subsequently taken to Columbus Hospital.[63]secondnameplaceholder was shot and killed by the special agents on July 22, 1934,[6][64][65] at approximately 10:40 p.m, according to a New York Times report the next day.[58] secondnameplaceholder's death came only two months after the deaths of fellow notorious criminals Bonnie and Clyde. There were reports of people dipping their handkerchiefs and skirts into the pool of blood that had formed, as secondnameplaceholder lay in the alley, as keepsakes: "Souvenir hunters madly dipped newspapers in the blood that stained the pavement. Handkerchiefs were whipped out and used to mop up the blood."[66]
<h2>Funeral</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's body was available for public display at the Cook County morgue.[67] An estimated 15,000 people viewed the corpse over a day and a half. As many as four death masks were also made.[68]secondnameplaceholder is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. secondnameplaceholder's gravestone has been replaced several times because of vandalism by people chipping off pieces as souvenirs.[69] Hilton Crouch (1903–1976), an associate of secondnameplaceholder's on some early heists, is buried only a few yards to the west.[70]In October 2019, Indiana state officials approved plans to exhume the remains buried in secondnameplaceholder's grave, at the request of secondnameplaceholder's relatives who believe that the man shot at the Biograph theater was not actually secondnameplaceholder. The FBI has dismissed this claim as a "conspiracy theory". The exhumation was scheduled for December 31, 2019.[71]
According to information from January 2020, secondnameplaceholder’s body will not be exhumed. His nephew and his niece quit those plans and History Channel also cancelled the idea.[72]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (March 17, 1942 – May 10, 1994) was an American serial killer and sex offender known as the Killer Clown who assaulted and murdered at least 33 young men and boys. Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as "Pogo the Clown" or "Patches the Clown", personas he had devised. He was also active in his local community as a Democratic Party precinct captain, and building contractor.According to Gacy, he committed all of his murders inside his ranch house near Norridge, a village in Norwood Park Township, metropolitan Chicago, Illinois. Typically, he would lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning handcuffs on the pretext of demonstrating a magic trick, then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either asphyxiation or strangulation with a garrote. Twenty-six victims were buried in the crawl space of his home, and three others were buried elsewhere on his property. Four were discarded in the Des Plaines River.Gacy was convicted of the sodomy of a teenage boy in Waterloo, Iowa, in 1968 and was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but served 18 months. He murdered his first victim in 1972, had murdered twice more by the end of 1975, and murdered at least 30 subsequent victims after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. The investigation into the disappearance of Des Plaines teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.His conviction for 33 murders (by one individual) then covered the most homicides in United States legal history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at Menard Correctional Center, he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center on May 10, 1994.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born in Chicago on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of firstnameplaceholder Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 – December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robison (May 4, 1908 – December 6, 1989).[2][3] His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and his mother was a homemaker.[4][5] Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic.[6] His paternal grandparents (who spelled the family name as "Gatza" or "Gaca") had immigrated to the United States from Poland (then part of Prussia in Germany).[2][7]Gacy was close to his mother and two sisters, but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an alcoholic who was physically abusive to his wife and children.[8][9] His father also belittled him, calling him "dumb and stupid" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.[2] One of Gacy's earliest memories was being beaten with a leather belt for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.[10] His mother tried to shield her son from his father's abuse, which only resulted in accusations that he was a "sissy" and a "Mama's boy" who would "probably grow up queer".[8][4][11] Despite his mistreatment, Gacy still loved his father,[9] but felt he was "never good enough" in his father's eyes.[12]In 1949, Gacy's father was informed his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl. His father whipped him with a razor strop as punishment.[13] The same year, a family friend and contractor would sometimes molest Gacy in his truck.[8][9] Gacy never told his father about this, afraid that his father would blame him.[2]Gacy was an overweight and unathletic child. Because of a heart condition, he was told to avoid all sports at school.[2] During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience blackouts. He was hospitalized on occasion because of these episodes and also, in 1957, for a burst appendix.[14] Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in hospital and attributed the decline of his grades to missing school. His father suspected these episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention and openly accused his son of faking the condition as Gacy lay in a hospital bed.[15] Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.[12][a]One of Gacy's friends in high school recalled several instances when his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, he witnessed Gacy's father emerging drunk from the family basement to begin belittling, then assaulting his son for no apparent reason.[b] Gacy's mother attempted to intervene as her son simply "put up his hands to defend himself". According to the friend, Gacy never struck his father back during these altercations.[18]In 1960, at 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant precinct captain for a Democratic Party candidate in his neighborhood. This led to more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a "patsy". Gacy later speculated his decision to become involved in politics was actually to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.[19]The same year Gacy's political involvement began, his father bought him a car. He kept the vehicle's title in his own name until Gacy had finished paying for it. These monthly payments took several years for him to complete. His father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as he said. In 1962, Gacy purchased an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the distributor cap, keeping the component for three days. Gacy recalled he felt "totally sick" and "drained" after this incident.[11]Hours after his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left home and drove to Las Vegas, Nevada. He found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. As a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the embalming room. He worked there for three months, observing morticians embalming dead bodies. He later confessed that one evening, while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.[8][c] This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.[11] His father agreed, and the same day he drove back to Chicago.[20]On returning home, Gacy enrolled at Northwestern Business College, despite having failed to graduate from high school. He graduated in 1963 and took a management trainee position with the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.[11][14] In 1964, the shoe company transferred him to Springfield, Illinois, to work as a salesman, and eventually promoted him to manager of his department.[8] In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker.[14]During their courtship, Gacy joined the local Jaycees and worked tirelessly for them, being named Key Man in April 1964.[2] That same year, he had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening on his sofa, he agreed; the colleague then performed oral sex on him while he was drunk.[21] By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.[14] The same year, he was named the third most outstanding Jaycee in the State of Illinois.[11]

After a six-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964.[13] Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) restaurants in Waterloo, Iowa. The couple moved there so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' former home, which had been vacated for the couple.[8][14] The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of about $123,900 as of 2021[update]), plus a share of the restaurant's profits.[11]Following the obligatory completion of a management course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife.[14] He opened a "club" in his basement where his employees could drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with the young men. Gacy gave many of them alcohol before he made sexual advances; if they rebuffed him, he would claim his advances were simply jokes or a test of morals.[8]Gacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy later described this period of his life as "perfect"—he had finally earned his father's approval. When Gacy's parents visited in July 1966, his father privately apologized for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted throughout his son's childhood and adolescence and said, "Son, I was wrong about you," as he shook Gacy's hand.[22]In Waterloo, Gacy joined the local Jaycees chapter, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three KFCs. At meetings, Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called "Colonel".[11] Although Gacy was considered ambitious and something of a braggart, the other Jaycees held him in high regard for his fund-raising work, and in 1967 named him "outstanding vice-president" of the Waterloo Jaycees.[14] The same year, Gacy served on the board of directors.[23] Gacy and other Waterloo Jaycees were also deeply involved in wife swapping, prostitution, pornography, and drug use.[8][21]In August 1967, Gacy sexually assaulted 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house upon the promise of showing him heterosexual stag films regularly played at Jaycee events. Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol, allowed him to watch a stag movie, then persuaded him to engage in mutual oral sex, adding "You have to have sex with a man before you start having sex with women."[22] Over the following months Gacy similarly abused several other youths, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before blackmailing him into performing oral sex on him. Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned to conduct homosexual experiments in the interests of scientific research, and paid them up to $50 each.[8]In March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police who arrested Gacy and subsequently charged him with performing oral sodomy on Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.[8] Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a polygraph test. The results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to both young men.[24]Gacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated—Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees. Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.[24]On August 30, 1968, Gacy persuaded one of his employees, 18-year-old Russell Schroeder, to physically assault Voorhees in an effort to discourage the boy from testifying. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300. Schroeder agreed, and in early September lured Voorhees to an isolated country park, sprayed Mace in his eyes, then beat him.[24][25]Voorhees escaped and reported the assault to police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. They arrested him the following day. While initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to assaulting Voorhees, indicating he had done so at Gacy's request. Police arrested Gacy and laid an additional charge of hiring Schroeder to assault and intimidate Voorhees against him.[8]On September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at the Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Iowa. Two doctors examined him over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an antisocial personality disorder (the clinical term for sociopathy and/or psychopathy), was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society. The doctors concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.[8][26]On November 7, 1968, Gacy pleaded guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths. Gacy claimed Voorhees had offered himself to him and that he had acted out of curiosity. His story was not believed. Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3 and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, to be served at the Anamosa State Penitentiary.[8][27][28]That same day, his wife petitioned for divorce, requesting she be awarded the couple's home and property, sole custody of their two children, and alimony.[29][30] The Court ruled in her favor, and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.[8]During his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.[8] Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased its membership from 50 to 650 men in less than 18 months. He is known to have secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates in the prison.[29] Gacy once oversaw the installation of a miniature golf course in the prison recreation yard.[31][d]In June 1969, Gacy was denied parole. To prepare for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.[8]On Christmas Day 1969, Gacy's father died from cirrhosis of the liver. When told the news, Gacy collapsed to the floor sobbing.[8] His request for supervised compassionate leave to attend the funeral was denied.[29]
<h2>Return to Chicago</h2>
Gacy was granted parole with 12 months' probation on June 18, 1970, after having served 18 months of his 10-year sentence.[31][33] Conditions of his probation included that Gacy relocate to Chicago to live with his mother, and that he must observe a 10:00 p.m. curfew.[8][29]On his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane—who picked him up from the prison and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence—that he would "never go back to jail" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy had relocated to Chicago.[8] He arrived there on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a short-order cook in a restaurant.[33]On February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy who claimed that he had lured him into his car at Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the boy into sex. The court dismissed this complaint when the boy failed to appear.[29]On June 22, Gacy was arrested and charged with aggravated sexual battery and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth who claimed that Gacy had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.[34] These charges were dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy.[33]The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of these incidents and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.[29] The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions were sealed.[e]With financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a ranch house near the village of Norridge in Norwood Park Township, an unincorporated area of Cook County, a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where, according to Gacy, he committed all his murders.[36]Gacy was active in his local community. His neighbors considered him helpful. He willingly loaned his construction tools and plowed snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.[37] Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by up to four hundred people, including politicians.[38]In August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a divorcee with two young daughters whom he had briefly dated in high school. They were married on July 1, 1972.[8] His fiancée and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.[33] Gacy's mother moved out of the house shortly before the wedding.[8]By 1975, Gacy had told his wife that he was bisexual.[39] After the couple had sex on Mother's Day that year, he informed her this would be "the last time" they would ever have sex.[34] He began spending most evenings away from home only to return in the early hours of the morning with the excuse he had been working late. His wife observed Gacy bringing teenage boys into his garage in the early hours and also found gay pornography and men's wallets and identification inside the house. When she confronted Gacy about who these items belonged to, he informed her angrily that it was none of her business.[33]Following a heated argument when she failed to balance a checkbook correctly in October 1975, Carole Gacy asked her husband for a divorce.[40] Gacy agreed to his wife's request although, by mutual consent, Carole continued to live at 8213 West Summerdale until February 1976, when she and her daughters moved into their own apartment. One month later, on March 2, the Gacys' divorce—decreed upon the false grounds of Gacy's infidelity with women—was finalized.[37][41][42][f]In 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors. The initials "PDM" were for "Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance".[33] With the approval of his probation officer, he worked evenings on his construction contracts while working as a cook during the day. Initially, Gacy undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete and redecorating, but he later expanded to include projects such as interior design, remodeling, installation, assembly and landscaping. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook so he could commit fully to his construction business.[34]By 1975, PDM was expanding rapidly, and Gacy was working up to 16 hours per day. In March 1977, he became a supervisor for PE Systems, a firm specializing in the remodeling of drugstores. Between PE Systems and PDM, Gacy worked on up to four projects simultaneously and frequently traveled to other states.[44] By 1978, PDM's annual revenue was over $200,000.[43][g]Through his membership in a local Moose Club, Gacy became aware of a "Jolly Joker" clown club, whose members regularly performed at fundraising events and parades in addition to voluntarily entertaining hospitalized children.[40] In late 1975, Gacy joined the clown club and created his own clown characters "Pogo the Clown" and "Patches the Clown", devising his own makeup and costumes. He described Pogo as a "happy clown", whereas Patches was a "more serious" character.[46]Gacy seldom earned money for his performances and later said that acting as a clown allowed him to "regress into childhood". He performed as both Pogo and Patches at numerous local parties, political functions, charitable events, and children's hospitals.[40] Sometimes Gacy would remain in his clowning garb after a performance, and briefly drink at a local bar before returning home.[47][48] Gacy's voluntary public service as a clown throughout the years of his murders led to him being known as the "Killer Clown".[49]Much of PDM's workforce consisted of high school students and young men.[50] Gacy would often proposition his workers for sex, or insist on sexual favors in return for acts such as lending his vehicles, financial assistance or promotions.[51] He also claimed to own guns, once telling an employee "Do you know how easy it would be to get one of my guns and kill you—and how easy it would be to get rid of the body?"[52]In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee traveled to Florida to view a property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped him in their hotel room. After returning to Chicago, this employee drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy told his wife he had been attacked for refusing to pay him for poor quality painting work.[34]In May 1975, Gacy hired 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci. In July 1975, Gacy went to Antonucci's home. The two drank a bottle of wine, then watched a heterosexual stag film before Gacy wrestled Antonucci to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back. One cuff was loose and Antonucci freed his arm while Gacy was out of the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci—a high school wrestler—pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key, and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. At first, Gacy threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if he would remove the handcuffs. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left. Antonucci later recalled that Gacy told him: "Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs, you got them on me."[34]On July 26, 1976, Gacy picked up 18-year-old David Cram as he hitchhiked on Elston Avenue. Gacy offered him a job with PDM, and he began work the same evening. On August 21, Cram moved into his house. The next day, he and Gacy had several drinks to celebrate his 19th birthday, with Gacy dressed as Pogo. Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs, his wrists cuffed in front of his body rather than behind. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself from the handcuffs.[51]A month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door intending to rape him, saying "Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want." Cram resisted, straddling Gacy, who left the bedroom, stating "You ain't no fun." Cram moved out on October 5, and left PDM, although he did periodically work for Gacy over the following two years.[51][53]
Shortly after Cram moved out of Gacy's house another employee, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved in.[33][44][54] Rossi had worked for PDM Contractors since May 1976.[55] He lived with Gacy until April 1977.[i] Rossi sometimes assisted Gacy in clowning at grand openings of businesses: Gacy as Pogo and Rossi as Patches.[40][46]Gacy also entered local Democratic Party politics, initially offering use of his employees to clean party headquarters at no charge. He was rewarded for his community service with an appointment to serve on the Norwood Park Township street lighting committee, subsequently earning the title of precinct captain.[33][43][35]In 1975, Gacy was appointed director of Chicago's annual Polish Constitution Day Parade—he supervised the annual event from 1975 until 1978. Through his work with the parade, Gacy met and was photographed with First Lady Rosalynn Carter on May 6, 1978.[43] The event later became an embarrassment to the United States Secret Service. In the pictures, Gacy is wearing an "S" pin, indicating a person given special clearance.[56]
<h2>Murders</h2>
Gacy murdered at least 33 young men and boys, and buried 26 of them in the crawl space of his house. Gacy usually lured a lone victim to his house, although on more than one occasion Gacy also had what he called "doubles"—two victims killed in the same evening.[57] Several victims were lured with the promise of a job with PDM, others with an offer of drink, drugs, or money for sex. His victims included people he knew and random individuals lured from Chicago's Greyhound Bus station, Bughouse Square, or simply off the streets. Some victims were grabbed by force, others conned into believing Gacy (who often carried a sheriff's badge and had spotlights on his black Oldsmobile) was a policeman.[36][58]Inside Gacy's home his usual modus operandi was to ply a youth with drink, drugs, or generally gain his trust. Gacy would then produce a pair of handcuffs to show a magic trick, sometimes as part of a clowning routine. He typically cuffed his own hands behind his back, then surreptitiously released himself with the key which he hid between his fingers. He then offered to show his intended victim how to release himself from the handcuffs.[59] With his victim manacled and unable to free himself, Gacy then made a statement to the effect that "The trick is, you have to have the key."[60] Gacy referred to this act of restraining his victim as the "handcuff trick".[51]Having restrained his victim, Gacy proceeded to rape and torture his captive. He frequently began by sitting on his victim's chest before forcing the victim to fellate him.[61] He then inflicted acts of torture including burning with cigars, making his captive imitate a horse as he sat on their back and pulled upon makeshift reins around their necks, and violation with foreign objects such as dildos and prescription bottles after he had sodomized his captive.[62] To immobilize his captives' legs before engaging in acts of torture, Gacy frequently manacled their ankles to a two-by-four with handcuffs attached at each end, an act inspired by the Houston Mass Murders.[63][j] He is also known to have verbally taunted many of his victims throughout their continued abuse,[67] and to have dragged or forced several victims to crawl into his bathroom, where he partly drowned them in the bathtub before repeatedly reviving them, enabling him to continue his prolonged assault.[62][68]Gacy typically murdered his victims by placing a rope tourniquet around their neck before progressively tightening the rope with a hammer handle.[69] He referred to this act as the "rope trick", frequently informing his captive, "This is the last trick."[62] In at least one instance, he had read part of Psalm 23 as he tightened the rope around his victim's neck.[36] Occasionally, the victim had convulsed for an "hour or two" before dying, although several victims died by asphyxiation from cloth gags stuffed deep into their throat.[70] Except for his two final victims, all were murdered between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.[36]After death, Gacy usually stored the victims' bodies under his bed for up to 24 hours before burying his victim in the crawl space, where he periodically poured quicklime to hasten the decomposition of his victims.[36][k] Some victims' bodies were taken to his garage and embalmed prior to their burial.[20]Gacy's first known murder occurred on January 3, 1972. According to Gacy's later account, following a family party on the evening of January 2, he decided to drive to the Civic Center in the Loop to view a display of ice sculptures in the early hours of the following morning. He then lured a 16-year-old named Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound Bus Terminal into his car. McCoy was traveling from Michigan to Omaha, Nebraska. Gacy took McCoy on a sightseeing tour of Chicago and then drove him to his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station in time to catch his bus.[72][l] Prior to McCoy's identification, he was known simply as the "Greyhound Bus Boy".[74]Gacy claimed he woke early the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand.[20] He then jumped from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm.[m] Gacy twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against the bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked Gacy in the stomach, doubling him over. Gacy then grabbed McCoy, shouting, "Motherfucker! I'll kill you!"[76] He then wrestled McCoy to the floor and stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him.[39]As McCoy lay dying, Gacy claimed he washed the knife in his bathroom, then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand.[20] Gacy buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered his grave with a layer of concrete.[39] In an interview several years after his arrest, Gacy said that immediately after killing McCoy, he felt "totally drained", yet noted that as he stabbed McCoy and as he listened to the "gurgulations" and gasping for air that he had experienced a mind-numbing orgasm. He added: "That's when I realized that death was the ultimate thrill."[20]Gacy said the second time he committed murder was around January 1974.[77] This victim remains unidentified. Gacy strangled him and then placed the body in his closet before burial.[78][79] He later stated that bodily fluids leaked from the victim's mouth and nose, staining his carpet. As a result, Gacy regularly stuffed cloth rags, the victim's own underwear, or a sock into the mouths of subsequent victims to prevent this leakage from recurring.[80]On July 31, 1975, another of Gacy's employees, firstnameplaceholder Butkovich, an 18-year-old from Lombard, disappeared.[81] Butkovich's car was found parked near the corner of Sheridan and Lawrence with his jacket and wallet inside and the keys still in the ignition.[82]The day before his disappearance, Butkovich had confronted Gacy over two weeks' outstanding back pay. Butkovich's father, a Yugoslav immigrant, called Gacy, who claimed he was happy to help search for his son but was sorry Butkovich had "run away". When questioned by police, Gacy said Butkovich and two friends had arrived at his house demanding the overdue pay, but they had reached a compromise, and all three had left. Over the following three years, Butkovich's parents called police more than 100 times, urging them to investigate Gacy further.[37][82]Gacy later admitted to encountering Butkovich exiting his car at the corner of West Lawrence Avenue, waving to attract his attention. According to Gacy, Butkovich approached his car, stating "I wanna talk to you." Gacy invited Butkovich into his car, then invited him back to his home, ostensibly to settle the issue of his overdue wages.[n]At his home, Gacy offered Butkovich a drink, then conned him into allowing his wrists to be cuffed behind his back. Gacy later confessed to having "sat on the kid's chest for a while" before he strangled him. He stowed Butkovich's body in his garage, intending to bury the body later in the crawl space. When his wife and stepdaughters returned earlier than expected, Gacy buried Butkovich's body under the concrete floor of the garage in an empty space where he had initially intended to dig a drain tile.[82]In addition to being the year his business expanded, Gacy freely admitted 1975 was also when he began to increase the frequency of his excursions for sex with young males.[34] He often referred to these jaunts as "cruising".[38] Gacy committed most of his murders between 1976 and 1978, as he largely lived alone following his divorce. He later referred to these as his "cruising years".Although Gacy remained gregarious and civic-minded, several neighbors noticed erratic changes in his behavior after his 1976 divorce. This included seeing him keeping company with young males, hearing his car arrive or depart in the early hours of the morning, or seeing lights in his home switch on and off in the early hours.[41] One neighbor later recollected that, for several years, the sounds of muffled high-pitched screaming, shouting, and crying had repeatedly awakened her and her son in the early morning hours. She identified the sounds as emanating from a house adjacent to theirs on Summerdale Avenue.[70]One month after his divorce was finalized, Gacy abducted and murdered 18-year-old Darrell Samson. He was last seen alive in Chicago on April 6, 1976.[38] Gacy buried him under the dining room, with a section of cloth lodged in his throat.[83] Five weeks later, on the afternoon of May 14, 15-year-old Randall Reffett disappeared while walking home from Senn High School. Hours after Gacy abducted Reffett, 14-year-old Samuel Stapleton vanished as he walked home from his sister's apartment.[41][84] They were buried together in the crawl space, and investigators believe both victims were murdered the same evening.[85]On June 3, Gacy killed a 17-year-old Lakeview teenager named Michael Bonnin. He disappeared while traveling from Chicago to Waukegan. Gacy strangled Bonnin with a ligature and buried him under the spare bedroom.[85][86][87] Ten days later, Gacy murdered a 16-year-old Uptown youth named William Carroll and buried him in a common grave in the crawl space. Carroll seems to have been the first of four victims known to have been murdered between June 13 and August 6, 1976.[84] Three were between 16 and 17 years old, and one unidentified murder victim appears to have been an adult.On August 5, a 16-year-old Minnesota youth named James Haakenson is last known to have phoned his family, possibly from Gacy's home.[88][89] Haakenson died of suffocation. His body was buried in the crawl space beneath the body of a 17-year-old Bensenville youth named Rick firstnameplaceholderston, who was last seen alive on August 6.[90][91][o]Gacy is thought to have murdered two further unidentified males between August and October 1976. On October 24, Gacy abducted and killed teenage friends Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino: the two were last seen outside a restaurant on Clark Street in Chicago.[93][94] Two days later, a 19-year-old construction worker, William Bundy, disappeared after informing his family he was to attend a party.[95] Bundy died of suffocation. Gacy buried the body beneath his master bedroom.[96] Apparently he had worked for Gacy.[97]In December 1976, another PDM employee, 17-year-old Gregory Godzik, disappeared. His girlfriend last saw him outside her house after he had driven her home following a date.[98][99] Godzik had worked for PDM for only three weeks before he disappeared. He had informed his family that Gacy had had him "dig trenches for some kind of (drain) tiles" in his crawl space. Godzik's car was later found abandoned in Niles. His parents and older sister, Eugenia, contacted Gacy about Godzik's disappearance. Gacy claimed that he had run away from home, having indicated before that he wished to do so. Gacy also claimed to have received an answering machine message from Godzik shortly after he had disappeared. When asked if he could play back the message to Godzik's parents, Gacy said he had erased it.[54][100]On January 20, 1977, Gacy lured 19-year-old firstnameplaceholder Szyc to his house on the pretext of buying his Plymouth Satellite.[99] He later confessed to strangling Szyc in his spare bedroom, claiming Rossi was asleep in the house the following morning. Gacy later sold the car to Rossi for $300.[44]Between December 1976 and March 1977, it is known Gacy killed an unidentified adult male. He buried him in the crawl space beneath the body of a 20-year-old Michigan native named Jon Prestidge, who had disappeared on March 15.[85] Shortly before his disappearance, Prestidge had mentioned he had obtained work with a local contractor.[101]Gacy murdered one additional unidentified youth and buried him in the crawl space in the spring or early summer of 1977; the exact time of this murder is unknown. On July 5, Gacy killed a 19-year-old from Crystal Lake, Matthew Bowman. Bowman's mother last saw him at a suburban train station.[85]The following month, Rossi was arrested for stealing gasoline while driving firstnameplaceholder Szyc's car. The gas station attendant noted the license plate and police traced the car to Gacy's house. When questioned, Gacy told officers that Szyc had sold the car to him in February, saying he needed money to leave town. A check of the VIN confirmed the car had belonged to Szyc.[55] The police did not pursue the matter further, although they did inform Szyc's mother that her son had sold his car.[44][p]By the end of 1977, it is known Gacy had murdered six more young men between the ages of 16 and 21. The first of these victims was 18-year-old Robert Gilroy, the son of a Chicago police sergeant, last seen alive on September 15.[85][56] Gilroy lived just four blocks from Gacy. He was murdered and buried in the crawl space. On September 12, Gacy had flown to Pittsburgh to supervise a remodeling project, and did not return to Chicago until September 16.[102] Because Gacy is known to have been in another state at the time Gilroy was last seen, this is cited to support Gacy's claim of assistance from one or more accomplices in several homicides. Ten days after Gilroy was last seen, 19-year-old former U.S. Marine firstnameplaceholder Mowery disappeared after leaving his mother's house to walk to his apartment.[85] Gacy strangled Mowery and buried his body beneath the master bedroom.[96]On October 17, 21-year-old Minnesota native Russell Nelson disappeared: he was last seen outside a Chicago bar. Nelson was looking for contracting work.[101] Gacy murdered him and buried him beneath the guest bedroom. Less than four weeks later, Gacy murdered a 16-year-old Kalamazoo teenager named Robert Winch and buried him in the crawl space. On November 18, 20-year-old father-of-one Tommy Boling disappeared after leaving a Chicago bar.[85]Three weeks after the murder of Tommy Boling, on December 9, a 19-year-old U.S. Marine, David Talsma, disappeared after informing his mother he was to attend a rock concert in Hammond.[85][44] Gacy strangled Talsma with a ligature and buried him in the crawl space, close to the body of firstnameplaceholder Mowery.[96]On December 30, Gacy abducted 19-year-old student Robert Donnelly from a Chicago bus stop at gunpoint.[103] Gacy drove him to his home, where he raped, tortured, and repeatedly dunked Donnelly's head into a bathtub until he passed out. Gacy taunted him with statements such as, "Aren't we playing fun games tonight?"[68] Donnelly later testified at Gacy's trial that he was in such pain that he asked Gacy to kill him. Gacy replied "I'm getting 'round to it."[103] After several hours, Gacy drove Donnelly to his workplace and released him, warning him that if he complained to police, they would not believe him.[68]Donnelly reported the assault, and police questioned Gacy on January 6, 1978. Gacy admitted to having had a "slave-sex" relationship with Donnelly, but insisted everything was consensual, adding that he "didn't pay the kid" the money he had promised him.[104] The police believed him and filed no charges.[56] The following month, Gacy killed 19-year-old William Kindred, who disappeared on February 16 after telling his fiancée, who knew Gacy,[105] that he was to spend the evening in a bar.[56] Kindred was the final victim Gacy buried in his crawl space.[46][43]On March 21, Gacy lured 26-year-old Jeffrey Rignall into his car.[106] Shortly after Rignall entered the car, Gacy chloroformed him and drove him to his house, where his arms and head were restrained in a pillory device affixed to the ceiling and his feet locked into another device. Gacy explained to Rignall he had complete control over him and that he intended to do whatever he wanted to him, when he wanted, and how he wanted.[107] He then raped and tortured Rignall with various instruments including lit candles and whips and repeatedly chloroformed him into unconsciousness. Gacy then drove Rignall to Chicago's Lincoln Park, where he was dumped, unconscious but alive.[q]Rignall managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment. Police were informed of the assault but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the haze of that night, the Oldsmobile, the Kennedy Expressway and particular side streets. He and two friends staked out the Cumberland exit of the Expressway and in April Rignall saw the Oldsmobile, which he and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale.[43] Police obtained an arrest warrant, and Gacy was arrested on July 15. He faced trial for battery against Rignall.[56]By 1978, the crawl space had no room for further bodies.[108][36][8] Gacy later confessed to police that he considered stowing bodies in his attic initially, but had been worried about complications arising from "leakage".[39] Therefore, he chose to dispose of his victims off the I-55 bridge into the Des Plaines River.[56] Gacy stated he had thrown five bodies into a river in 1978. He believed one had landed on a passing barge;[36] only four bodies were ever found.[101]The first known victim thrown from the I-55 bridge into the Des Plaines River was 20-year-old Timothy O'Rourke. He was murdered in mid-June after leaving his Dover Street apartment to purchase cigarettes. Shortly before his disappearance, O'Rourke had told his roommate a contractor on the Northwest Side had offered him a job.[43][84]On November 4, Gacy killed 19-year-old Frank Landingin. His naked body was found in the Des Plaines River in Channahon, on November 12.[84] On November 24, a 20-year-old Elmwood Park resident, James Mazzara, disappeared after sharing Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Mazzara had informed his sister the day prior to his disappearance that he was working in the construction industry and "doing all right".[84] He was last seen alive walking in the direction of Bughouse Square, carrying a suitcase.[43]On the afternoon of December 11, 1978, Gacy visited the Nisson Pharmacy in Des Plaines, to discuss a potential remodeling deal with the store owner, Phil Torf.[109] While he was within earshot of 15-year-old part-time employee Robert Piest, Gacy mentioned his firm often hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour—almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.[1]Shortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest's mother arrived at the store to drive her son home so the family could celebrate her birthday together.[43] Piest asked his mother to wait, adding that "some contractor wants to talk to me about a job". He left the store at 9:00 p.m., promising to return shortly.[1]Piest was murdered shortly after 10:00 p.m. at Gacy's home.[1] Gacy later stated that at his house, he asked Piest whether there was anything he "wouldn't do for the right price", to which Piest replied that he did not mind working hard. In response, Gacy stated "good money" could be earned by hustling, although Piest was dismissive. Gacy then duped Piest into donning handcuffs before saying, "I'm going to rape you, and you can't do anything about it" as Piest began weeping.[43] He also stated that as he placed the rope around Piest's neck, the boy was "crying, scared".[110] Gacy admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying, suffocating on his bedroom floor.[43]
<h2>Investigation</h2>
When Piest failed to return, his family filed a missing person report with the Des Plaines police. Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk to about a job. Lieutenant Joseph Kozenczak, whose son attended Maine West High School like Piest, chose to investigate Gacy further.[111] Having spoken with Piest's mother on the morning of December 12, Kozenczak became convinced Piest had not run away from home.[112] A routine check of Gacy's criminal background revealed that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.[113]Kozenczak and two Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them—whom he believed to be Piest—whether there were any remodeling materials behind the store.[113] He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job, and had only returned to the pharmacy shortly after 8:00 p.m. as he had left his appointment book at the store.[43] Gacy promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded, "You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?"[58]At 3:20 a.m., Gacy arrived at the police station covered in mud, claiming he had been involved in a car accident. On returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in Piest's disappearance and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy, Gacy reiterated that he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who denied calling Gacy. At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.[113]Suspecting Gacy might be holding Piest against his will at his home, Des Plaines police obtained a warrant to search Gacy's house on December 13.[113] This search of Gacy's property revealed several suspicious items, including several police badges and a 6mm Brevettata starter pistol inside an office drawer, and a syringe and hypodermic needle inside a cabinet in Gacy's bathroom. Investigators also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and pederasty,[114] seven pornographic films, capsules of amyl nitrite, and an 18 in (46 cm) dildo in Gacy's bedroom.[115] A 39 in (99 cm) two-by-four with two holes drilled into each end, bottles of Valium and atropine, and several driver's licenses were found in the northwest bedroom. A blue hooded parka was found atop a tool box inside the laundry room, and underwear too small to fit Gacy was located inside a bathroom closet.[116]In the northwest bedroom, investigators found a class of 1975 Maine West High School ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.[117] Investigators also recovered a Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt from a trash can, alongside a 36 in (91 cm) section of nylon rope.[58]The Des Plaines police confiscated Gacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles. Police assigned two, two-man surveillance teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.[118] These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.[119] The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river earlier that year.[99][120]On December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details of Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, then chloroformed, raped and tortured him before dumping him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of firstnameplaceholder Butkovich.[117] The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a firstnameplaceholder Alan Szyc.[99] An interview with Szyc's mother revealed that several items from her son's apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.[121]By December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or at his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers more than once.[122] That afternoon, Cram consented to a police interview, in which he described Gacy's hard-working lifestyle, and "open-minded" attitude regarding sex between men. Cram also revealed that, because of his poor timekeeping, Gacy had once given him a watch, explaining he got it "from a dead person".[123]Investigators conducted a formal interview of Rossi on December 17. He informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him, explaining that he had bought the car from Szyc because he needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained German shepherd search dogs to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles. One dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay on the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a "death reaction", indicating Piest's body had been present in the vehicle.[117]That evening, Gacy invited detectives Albrecht and Hachmeister to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited them into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during the conversation, Gacy remarked: "You know ... clowns can get away with murder."[117][124]By December 18, Gacy was beginning to show signs of strain from the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 civil suit against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance.[121] The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy. Byers admitted, when contacted in person the following day, that she had worn the jacket on December 11 to shield herself from the cold. She had placed the receipt in the parka pocket just before she gave the coat to Piest as he left the store, claiming a contractor wanted to speak with him.[120] This statement contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.[125]The same evening, Rossi was interviewed a second time. This time he was more cooperative. He informed detectives that in the summer of 1977, at Gacy's behest, he had spread ten bags of lime in the crawl space of Gacy's house.[60]On December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant for Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing for the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited the surveillance detectives inside his house again. As officer Robinson distracted Gacy with conversation, officer Schultz walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to firstnameplaceholder Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, the officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a heating duct. The officers who had searched Gacy's house previously had failed to notice this, as the house had been cold.[118]Investigators interviewed both Cram and Rossi on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with firstnameplaceholder Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had concealed Piest's body, Rossi replied Gacy may have placed the body in the crawl space, adding that he thought Szyc's car was stolen.[126][46] Rossi agreed to submit to a polygraph test. He denied any involvement in Piest's disappearance, also denying any knowledge of his whereabouts. He soon refused to continue the questioning, and Rossi's "erratic and inconsistent" responses to questions while attached to the polygraph machine rendered Kozenczak "unable to render a definite opinion" as to the truthfulness of his answers.[60] Rossi did, however, further discuss the trench digging he did in the crawl space and remarked on Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.[127]Cram informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976. He stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale after seeing a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram said Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had once been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and had also dug trenches, which Gacy had explained were for drainage pipes. Cram stated these trenches were 2 feet (0.61 m) wide, 6 feet (1.8 m) long and 2 feet (0.61 m) deep—the size of graves.[60]On the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in Park Ridge to attend a scheduled meeting, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. On his arrival Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. On his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the Daily Herald from Amirante's desk, pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and said, "This boy is dead. He's dead. He's in a river."[128]Gacy then proceeded to give a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had "been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.[129] He said he buried most of his victims in his crawl space, and had disposed of five other bodies in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as "male prostitutes", "hustlers" and "liars" to whom he gave "the rope trick", adding he sometimes awoke to find "dead, strangled kids" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.[51] He had buried their bodies in his crawl space as he believed they were his property.[20]As a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession. Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00 a.m. that morning. On awakening several hours later, Gacy shook his head when informed by Amirante he had confessed to killing approximately 30 people, saying, "Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do." Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.[130]Gacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being "hazy", adding he knew his arrest was inevitable and that he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells. After leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of cannabis to the attendant, who immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him, "The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me." Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor and friend, Ronald Rhode. Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying, "I've been a bad boy. I killed thirty people, give or take a few."[126] Gacy left Rhode and drove to Cram's home to meet with Cram and Rossi. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a rosary to his chin, praying while he drove.[131]After talking with Cram and Rossi, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with lawyer Leroy Stevens. As Gacy spoke with him, Cram informed the surveillance officers that Gacy had told him and Rossi that he had confessed to over 30 murders with his lawyers the previous evening. Gacy then had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.[126]As Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined the formal draft of their second search warrant, specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. On hearing from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy may be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him on a charge of possession and distribution of cannabis in order to hold him in custody, as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented.[r][131] At 4:30 p.m. on December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, Judge Marvin J. Peters granted the request for a second search warrant.[133] After police informed Gacy of their intentions to search his crawl space for the body of Piest, Gacy denied the teenager was buried there, but confessed to having killed a young man in self-defense and whose body was buried under his garage.[101]Armed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians drove to Gacy's home. On their arrival, officers found Gacy had unplugged his sump pump, flooding the crawl space with water; to clear it, they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the 28-by-38-foot (8.5 m × 11.6 m) crawl space, crawled to the southwest area and began digging.[2] Within minutes, he had uncovered putrefied flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder, adding, "I think this place is full of kids." A police photographer then dug in the northeast corner of the crawl space, uncovering a patella. The two then began digging in the southeast corner, uncovering two lower leg bones.[36]The victims were too decomposed to be Piest. As the body discovered in the northeast corner was later unearthed, a crime scene technician discovered the skull of a second victim alongside this body. Later excavations of the feet of this second victim revealed a further skull beneath the body.[84] Because of this, technicians returned to the trench where the first body was unearthed, discovering the rib cage of a fourth victim within the crawl space, confirming the scale of the murders.[134]After being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to "clear the air", adding he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.[36]In the early morning hours of December 22, and in the presence of his lawyers, Gacy provided a formal statement in which he confessed to murdering approximately 30 young males—all of whom he claimed had entered his house willingly.[36] Some victims were referred to by name, but Gacy claimed not to know or remember most of the names.[61] He claimed all were teenage male runaways or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.[36] Gacy claimed to have only dug five of the victims' graves in this location and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would "have graves available".[110] One victim hailed from Round Lake; another had been a Michigan native. When shown a driver's license issued to a Robert Hasten which had been found on his property, Gacy claimed not to know him but admitted this license had been in the possession of one of his victims.[135] In January 1979, he had planned to conceal the corpses even further by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.[43]When questioned specifically about Piest, Gacy confessed to luring him to his house and strangling him on the evening of December 11. He also admitted to having slept alongside Piest's body that evening, before disposing of the corpse in the Des Plaines River in the early hours of December 13.[136] On his way to the police station, he had been in a minor traffic accident after disposing of Piest. His vehicle had slid off an ice-covered road and had to be towed from its location.[36]Accompanied by police, his lawyers, and his older sister, Gacy was driven to the I-55 bridge on December 23 to pinpoint the precise spot where he confessed to having thrown the body of Robert Piest and four other victims into the Des Plaines River.[137][43] Gacy was then taken to his house and instructed to mark his garage floor with orange spray-paint to show where he had buried the individual he had supposedly killed in self-defense, whom he named as firstnameplaceholder Butkovich.[54]To assist officers in their search for the victims buried beneath his house, during his confession, Gacy drew a rough diagram of his basement on a phone message sheet to indicate where their bodies were buried.[s] Twenty-six bodies were unearthed from Gacy's crawl space over the next week; three more were also unearthed elsewhere on his property.[84]Cook County medical examiner Robert Stein supervised the exhumations.[138] Each victim unearthed from the crawl space was placed in a body bag, which was placed near the front door awaiting transportation to the mortuary.[84]The crawl space was marked in sections and each body was given an identifying number. The first body recovered from the crawl space was assigned a marker denoting the victim as Body 1. Gacy had buried this victim in the northeast section of the crawl space directly beneath the room he used as his office.[96] No cause of death could be determined.The body of firstnameplaceholder Butkovich was labelled as Body 2.[135] On December 23, investigators returned to unearth the three corpses which had been buried in the same trench as Body 1.[139] Body 3 was buried in the crawl space directly above Body 4.[84] Alongside them, Body 5 was buried directly beneath Body 1.[96]The search for victims was postponed temporarily over Christmas. Four more bodies were unearthed on December 26.[140] Bodies number 6 and 7 were buried in the same grave.[46] Body 7 was found in a fetal position. A cloth gag was found in the mouth, leading investigators to conclude this victim most likely died of asphyxiation.[85][86] Body 8 was found with the tourniquet used to strangle him still knotted around his neck.[141] Body 9 was found beneath a layer of concrete and was found to have several stab wounds to the ribs and sternum, suggesting he was Gacy's first victim.[39]On December 27, eight more bodies were discovered.[142] Body 10 was buried face upwards, parallel to the wall of the crawl space directly beneath the entrance to Gacy's home.[96] Both Body 11 and Body 12 were found face downwards with a ligature around their necks and both were buried beside each other in the center of the crawl space, directly beneath the hallway.[96] Body 13 was found beneath the spare bedroom; Bodies 14 and 15 were recovered from a common grave diagonal to Body 10. Both 14 and 15 were found with their head and upper torsos inside separate plastic bags. Body 16 was found close to Body 13. This victim was found with a cloth rag lodged deep in his throat, causing him to die of suffocation. The seventeenth victim was found with a ligature around his neck.[143]The following day, four more bodies were exhumed.[144] Body 19 was buried directly beneath Gacy's master bedroom, perpendicular to Body 18, which was located beneath the spare bedroom, and found with a ligature around the neck.[96] Body 20 was buried in the northwest corner of the crawl space perpendicular to Body 19.[96]By December 29, six more bodies were unearthed. Bodies 22, 23, 24, and 26 were buried in a common grave located beneath Gacy's kitchen and laundry room,[84] with Body 25 located beneath Gacy's bathroom.[96] Body 22 was found directly beneath Gacy's kitchen with a section of cloth-like material lodged in his throat. Two socks were recovered from the pelvic region.[85] This victim was buried directly beneath Body 21 (recovered the previous day). The bones of victims 23 and 24 were commingled together, and a section of cloth was found inside the mouth of Bodies 24 and 26.[84][145] Body 25 was found beneath Gacy's bathroom with a section of cloth lodged in the throat. The final victim recovered from the crawl space was also found beneath the bathroom, buried ten inches below the surface of the soil. This victim was found to have a section of cloth lodged deep in his throat.[96]Operations were suspended due to the Chicago Blizzard of 1979, but resumed in March despite Gacy's insistence that all the buried victims had been found.[25][146] On March 9, Body 28 was found wrapped within several plastic bags and buried beneath the patio approximately 15 feet (4.6 m) from the barbecue pit in Gacy's backyard.[147] On March 16, Body 29 was found beneath the dining room floor.[103]All the victims discovered at 8213 W. Summerdale were in an advanced state of decomposition. Dental records and X-ray charts helped Stein identify the remains.[143][148] Twenty-three victims were identified via dental records, with two further victims identified via skeletal trauma. These identifications were also supported with personal artifacts found in Gacy's home.[149]The head and upper torso of several bodies unearthed beneath Gacy's property had been placed into plastic bags.[t] Several were also found with a rope still around their necks. In some cases, bodies were found with foreign objects such as prescription bottles lodged into their pelvic region, the position of which indicated the items had been thrust into the victims' anus.[96]Stein concluded 12 victims recovered from Gacy's property died not of strangulation, but of asphyxiation.[43] Gacy's vacant house was demolished in April 1979.[150]The victim found 6 miles (9.7 km) downstream from the I-55 bridge on June 30 was not connected initially to Gacy.[151][84] In January 1979, this victim was identified using fingerprint records and a distinctive tattoo on his left biceps reading "Tim Lee" (an homage to Bruce Lee) as Timothy O'Rourke. An autopsy was unable to rule out strangulation as the cause of death.[43][152] This victim was numbered 31. Following Gacy's arrest, investigators discovered he was a further victim.Frank Landingin's cause of death was certified at autopsy as suffocation through his own underwear being lodged down his throat, plugging his airway and effectively causing him to drown in his own vomit. He was assigned victim number 32.[70]On December 28, one further body linked to Gacy was found 1 mile (1.6 km) from the I-55 bridge. This victim was identified as James Mazzara, whom Gacy confessed to having murdered shortly after Thanksgiving.[43] Mazzara had been strangled with a ligature.[70][153]On April 9, 1979, a decomposed body was discovered entangled in exposed roots on the edge of the Des Plaines River in Grundy County. The body was identified using dental records as being that of Robert Piest. A subsequent autopsy revealed that three wads of "paper-like material" had been shoved down his throat while he was still alive, causing him to suffocate.[135][154]
<h2>Trial</h2>
Gacy was brought to trial on February 6, 1980, charged with 33 murders.[155] He was tried in Cook County, Illinois, before Judge Louis Garippo; the jury was selected from Rockford, because of significant press coverage in Cook County.[156]At the request of his defense counsel, Gacy spent over three hundred hours with doctors at the Menard Correctional Center in Chester in the year before his trial. He underwent a variety of psychological tests before a panel of psychiatrists to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial.[126] Gacy attempted to convince the doctors that he had multiple personality disorder.[157] He claimed to have four personalities: the hard-working, civic-minded contractor, the clown, the active politician, and a policeman called Jack Hanley, whom he referred to as "Bad Jack". When Gacy had confessed to police, he claimed to be relaying the crimes of Jack, who detested homosexuality and who viewed male prostitutes as "weak, stupid and degraded scum".[38][158] His lawyers opted to have Gacy plead not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges against him. Presenting Gacy as a Jekyll and Hyde character, the defense produced several psychiatric experts who had examined Gacy.[157][159] Three psychiatric experts at Gacy's trial testified they found him to be a paranoid schizophrenic with multiple personalities.[108][160]The prosecutors presented the case that Gacy was sane and in full control of his actions.[103] To support this contention, they produced several witnesses to testify to the premeditation of Gacy's actions and the efforts he took to escape detection. Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personalities and insanity. Cram and Rossi testified that Gacy had made them dig drainage trenches and spread bags of lime in his crawl space.[u] Both said Gacy looked periodically into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees they supervised did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.[53][127][162]On February 18, Robert Stein testified that all the bodies recovered from Gacy's property were "markedly decomposed [and] putrefied, skeletalized remains", and that of all the autopsies he performed, thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation, six of ligature strangulation, one of multiple stab wounds to the chest and ten in undetermined ways.[39][163][v] When Gacy's defense team suggested that all 33 deaths were caused by accidental erotic asphyxia, Stein called this highly improbable.[43][164]Jeffrey Rignall testified on behalf of the defense on February 21.[164] Recounting his ordeal, Rignall wept repeatedly while describing Gacy's torture of him in March 1978. Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the "beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me".[165] During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.[166]On February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands and his subsequent attempts to dissuade him from testifying by paying another youth to spray Mace in his face and beat him. Voorhees felt unable to testify but did briefly attempt to do so before being asked to step down.[167]Robert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recalled the abuse he endured and came close to breaking down several times. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him, but Donnelly finished his testimony.[68] During Donnelly's cross-examination, one of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.[167]During the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a mistrial for a number of reasons, including that he did not approve of his lawyers' insanity plea; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had wanted to do); that his defense had not called enough medical witnesses, and that the police were lying with regard to verbal statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were "self-serving" for use by the prosecution.[20][168] Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that both counsels had not been denied the opportunity or funds to summon expert witnesses to testify, and that, under the law, he had the choice whether he wished to testify, and was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.[169]On March 11, final arguments by both prosecution and defense attorneys began; they concluded the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan spoke first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing his surviving victims—Voorhees and Donnelly—as "living dead". Referring to Gacy as the "worst of all murderers", Sullivan stated, "firstnameplaceholder Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all."[86][135]After the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante spoke for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.[159] Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a "man driven by compulsions he was unable to control", contending the State had not met their burden of proving Gacy sane beyond a reasonable doubt.[135]In support of these arguments, the defense referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and a former business associate of Gacy's—both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions. Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client and asked they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that Gacy was a danger to both himself and to others, and that studying his psychology and behavior would be of benefit to science.[159]On the morning of March 12, William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution.[159] Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as "a sham", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of one of the doctors who had examined Gacy in 1968 and had concluded he was an antisocial personality, capable of committing crimes without remorse and unlikely to benefit from social or psychiatric treatment, stating that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would not have been freed.[135]At the close of his argument, Kunkle removed photos of Gacy's 22 identified victims from a display board and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to "show justice". Kunkle then asked the jury to "show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them there!" before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door from Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom. After Kunkle had finished his testimony, the jury retired to consider their verdict.[135]The jury deliberated for less than two hours and found Gacy guilty of 33 charges of murder; he was also found guilty of sexual assault and taking indecent liberties with a child; both convictions in reference to Robert Piest.[135][170][171] At the time, his conviction for 33 murders was the most for which any person in U.S. history had been convicted.[48][172]In the sentencing phase of the trial, the jury deliberated for more than two hours before sentencing Gacy to death for each murder committed after the Illinois statute on capital punishment came into effect in June 1977.[135][173] His execution was set for June 2, 1980.[174]
<h2>Death row</h2>
On being sentenced, Gacy was transferred to the Menard Correctional Center, where he remained incarcerated on death row for 14 years.[174]Before his trial, Gacy initiated contact with WLS-TV journalist Russ Ewing, to whom he granted numerous interviews between 1979 and 1981.[175] Ewing later collaborated with author Tim Cahill to publish the book Buried Dreams.[176] Later, the information Gacy divulged to Ewing would prove instrumental in establishing the identity of his first victim.[177]On February 15, 1983, Henry Brisbon, a fellow death row inmate known as the I-57 killer, stabbed Gacy in the upper arm with a sharpened wire as Gacy was participating in a voluntary work program. A second death row inmate injured in the attack, William Jones, received a superficial stab wound to the head. Both received treatment in the prison hospital for their wounds.[178]After his incarceration, Gacy read numerous law books and filed voluminous motions and appeals, although he did not prevail in any of them. His appeals related to issues such as the validity of the first search warrant granted to the Des Plaines police on December 13, 1978, and his objection to his lawyers' insanity plea defense at his trial. Gacy also contended that, although he had "some knowledge" of five of the murders (those of McCoy, Butkovich, Godzik, Szyc and Piest), the other 28 murders had been committed by employees who had keys to his house while he was away on business trips.[20]In mid-1984, the Supreme Court of Illinois upheld Gacy's conviction and ordered his execution by lethal injection on November 14.[20] Gacy filed an appeal against this decision, which was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States on March 4, 1985. The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, Richard Kling, argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial. This post-conviction petition was dismissed on September 11, 1986.[179]Gacy appealed the 1985 decision that he be executed. The Illinois Supreme Court upheld his conviction on September 29, 1988, setting a new execution date of January 11, 1989.[180]After the U.S. Supreme Court denied Gacy's final appeal in October 1993, the Illinois Supreme Court formally set an execution date for May 10, 1994.[181]On the morning of May 9, 1994, Gacy was transferred from the Menard Correctional Center to Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, to be executed. That afternoon, he was allowed a private picnic on the prison grounds with his family. For his last meal, Gacy ordered a bucket of KFC, a dozen fried shrimp, french fries, fresh strawberries and a Diet Coke.[182] That evening, he observed prayer with a Catholic priest before being escorted to the Stateville execution chamber to receive a lethal injection.[183][184]Before the execution began, the chemicals used to effect the execution solidified unexpectedly, clogging the IV tube used to administer the chemicals into Gacy's arm, complicating the procedure. Blinds covering the window through which witnesses observed the execution were drawn. The execution team replaced the clogged tube. After ten minutes, the blinds were reopened, and the execution resumed. The entire procedure took 18 minutes.[185] Anesthesiologists blamed the problem on the prison officials' inexperience at conducting an execution, saying that had correct execution procedures been followed, the complications would never have occurred. This error apparently led to Illinois' adopting an alternative method of lethal injection. On this subject, one prosecutor at Gacy's trial, William Kunkle, said, "He got a much easier death than any of his victims."[186]According to published reports, Gacy was a diagnosed psychopath who did not express any remorse for his crimes.[187] His final statement to his lawyer before his execution was that killing him would not compensate for the loss of others, and that the state was murdering him.[186] His final spoken words were reported to be "Kiss my ass".[188]In the hours leading up to Gacy's execution, a crowd estimated at over 1,000 gathered outside the correctional center; a vocal majority were in favor of the execution, although a number of anti-death penalty protesters were also present.[189] Some of those in favor of the execution wore T-shirts hearkening to Gacy's previous community services as a clown and bearing satirical slogans such as "No tears for the clown".[190] The anti-death penalty protesters present observed a silent candlelight vigil.[191]After Gacy's death was confirmed at 12:58 a.m. on May 10, 1994, his brain was removed. It is in the possession of Helen Morrison, a witness for the defense at Gacy's trial, who has interviewed Gacy and other serial killers in an attempt to isolate common personality traits of violent sociopaths.[168] His body was cremated.[192]
<h2>Victims</h2>
Only 27 of Gacy's victims were conclusively identified. Of these, the youngest were Samuel Stapleton and Michael Marino, both 14; the oldest was Russell Nelson, who was 21. Six victims have never been identified.[193]The first victims to be identified were firstnameplaceholder Butkovich (Body 2), firstnameplaceholder Szyc (Body 3), and Gregory Godzik (Body 4). Dental records confirmed their identities on December 29, 1978. The thirty-third victim linked to Gacy, James Mazzara, was identified the following day.[101] The twenty-third victim exhumed from Gacy's property was identified as Rick firstnameplaceholderston on January 1, 1979.[84]Four further victims were identified on January 6. Body 18 was identified as Michael Bonnin and Body 25 as Robert Gilroy. The first victim exhumed from the crawl space was identified as Jon Prestidge, and the victim labelled Body 16 as Russell Nelson. A fishing license issued to Bonnin had been found previously in Gacy's home.[101] Three days later, the victim recovered from the Des Plaines River on June 30 was identified as Timothy O'Rourke.[101] On January 27, dental charts were used to identify Body 20 as firstnameplaceholder Mowery. Two days later, Body 8 was identified as Matthew Bowman.[101]Two months later, on March 17, the twenty-second victim recovered from Gacy's property was identified using dental records as William Carroll.[101] The following month, the identity of the seventh victim was confirmed using X-Ray records as Randall Reffett,[101] and on May 21, dental records confirmed that Body 27 was William Kindred.[101]On September 11, Bodies 11 and 12 were identified as Robert Winch and Tommy Boling, respectively. Winch was identified via X-ray records of a distinctive healed bone fracture. A distinctive brown "tiger's eye" metal buckle with black striping belonging to Winch was also found alongside his body.[101]Using dental records, the sixth victim exhumed from Gacy's property was identified on November 14, 1979, as Samuel Stapleton.[101] On November 16, Body 17 was identified as David Talsma using radiology images of a healed fracture of the left scapula.[143] Two days later, the final victim recovered from Gacy's property, Body 29, was identified as Darrell Samson.[101]In March 1980, Bodies 14 and 15 were identified using dental records and radiology images as those of Michael Marino and Kenneth Parker. Their identities were confirmed too late to include among the victims identified before Gacy's trial.[94][194][195]In May 1986, the ninth victim exhumed from Gacy's property was identified as Timothy Jack McCoy, Gacy's first victim.[196][197] Dental records and a distinctive belt buckle assisted with his identification.[177]In October 2011, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart announced that investigators, having obtained full DNA profiles from each of the unidentified victims, were to renew their efforts to identify them. At a press conference held to announce this, Sheriff Dart stated investigators are actively seeking DNA samples from individuals across the United States related to any male missing between 1970 and 1979.[198]Results of tests conducted thus far have confirmed the identification of two victims, ruled out the possibility of numerous other missing youths as being victims of Gacy,[199][200] and solved four unrelated cold cases dating between 1972 and 1979.[201][202][203][204] In November 2011, the victim previously known as Body 19 was identified through DNA testing as William Bundy.[97] Shortly after Gacy's arrest, Bundy's family had contacted his dentist in the hope of submitting his dental records for comparison with the unidentified bodies, but the records had been destroyed after his dentist had retired.[205] The most recent victim to be identified is 16-year-old James Haakenson, previously known as Body 24, who was identified in July 2017 using DNA testing.[206]Six victims remain unidentified, five of whom had been buried beneath Gacy's crawl space, and one buried approximately 15 feet (4.6 m) from the barbecue pit in his backyard.[207] In the fall of 1979,[208] forensic expert Betty Pat Gatliff used the skulls of the remaining unidentified victims to create facial reconstructions.[209][210]Based on Gacy's confession, the location of the victims buried in the crawl space, and forensic analysis, police determined the most likely dates for when his unidentified victims were killed.[211]Gacy's likely second murder victim, Body 28, had brown hair, stood approximately 5 ft 9 in (180 cm) in height, and is estimated to be aged between 14 and 18. He was buried near Gacy's barbecue pit, possibly in 1975.[100] He wore a silver ring on his left ring finger, suggesting he may have been married.[103][w]Body 26 was a man with medium dark brown hair estimated to have been aged between 23 and 30 years old and approximately 5 ft 4 in (160 cm) in height. This man had two missing upper front teeth at the time of his disappearance, leading investigators to believe he likely wore a denture. He was almost certainly murdered between June 13 and August 5, 1976.[212][213]Body 13 was a man likely to have been murdered between August and October 1976. He was between 5 ft 9 in and 6 ft 2 in (180 and 190 cm) in height. He had long, dark brown, wavy hair and was between 17 and 22 years old. This victim is known to have suffered from an abscessed tooth, and may have injured his left third rib months or years before his disappearance.[214][215] While Rossi also claimed to dig this grave in 1977, Cram claimed that during his time living at 8213 W. Summerdale, Gacy had him dig a trench in the southwest corner of the crawl space where this victim was recovered.[162] In 2018, an updated facial reconstruction was released to the media.[216]Body 21 is estimated to have been aged between 15 and 24 years old and approximately 5 ft 10 in (180 cm) in height. He had light brown hair.[217][218] This victim was buried directly above the body of William Carroll, indicating his murder had occurred on or after June 13, 1976. It is theorized Cram may not have lived with Gacy at the time of this victim's death, so a possible date for this murder is between August 6 and 20, 1976, although investigators have not discounted the possibility he may have been murdered later in 1976.[162][x]Body 5 was a man with brown hair, approximately 5 ft 9 in (180 cm) in height, and estimated to have been between 22 and 32 years old.[220] An inscription on a leather key fob found with his body suggests his first name may have been Greg or Gregory, and he is known to have fractured his nose months or years before his disappearance.[221] He was almost certainly murdered between December 1976 and March 15, 1977.[85]Body 10 is estimated to have been aged between 17 and 21 years old and between 5 ft 7 in and 5 ft 11 in (170 and 180 cm). He had suffered a fractured left collarbone months or years before his disappearance.[222] The two victims murdered on the same day in May 1976 were buried alongside him, yet sequential burial patterns of three victims murdered in 1977 leave an equal possibility he may have been murdered in the spring or summer of 1977. Statements made by Gacy following his arrest also suggest this unidentified victim may have been murdered as early as 1974.[223] In 2018, an updated facial reconstruction was released to the media.[216]
<h2>Possible additional victims</h2>
At the time of Gacy's arrest, he had claimed to both Des Plaines and Chicago investigators that the total number of murder victims could be as high as 45.[63] However, only 33 victims were ever linked to Gacy. Investigators excavated the grounds of his property until they had exposed the substratum of clay beneath the foundations, finding 29 bodies.[224] Gacy said that after he had assaulted and then released Jeffrey Rignall in March 1978, he began to throw his murder victims into the Des Plaines River. He confessed to having disposed of five bodies in this manner; however, only four bodies recovered from the Des Plaines River were linked to him.[43][225]
When asked whether there were more victims, Gacy stated, "That's for you guys to find out."[226]Disputed DNA and dental tests conducted between 2012 and 2016 indicate that neither body found in the common grave in Gacy's crawl space and identified as those of Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino in 1980 was actually Marino.[227][228][229] Marino's mother had always doubted her son 's identification because the clothing found on Body 14 was inconsistent with what he had worn when she last saw him.[230] DNA testing conducted upon the exhumed body of Parker has proven that Marino's body had not been mistaken for his.[y]In addition, the dental X-ray conducted on the victim identified as Michael Marino had revealed they had all of their second molars; a dental X-ray conducted on Marino in March 1976 revealed one molar had not erupted.[231] The original identification of the body identified as Michael Marino has been disputed because the exhumed body had neither an upper nor lower jaw bone.[232] Nonetheless, the orthodontist who had identified Marino's remains has stated his conviction in the accuracy of his findings, adding he had "compared 32 teeth, probably half a dozen of them had very distinct fillings and every one of them was consistent with Michael Marino".[233]On May 23, 1978, 25-year-old Charles Antonio Hattula was found drowned in the Pecatonica River near Freeport, Illinois. He had been missing since May 13.[234] Hattula was an employee of PDM and had been linked to the initial investigation of Gacy after Michael Rossi informed investigators of both Godzik's disappearance and Hattula's death. Moreover, Rossi had stated that Hattula was known to have conflicts with Gacy, and when he had "failed to show up at work", Gacy had informed him and several other employees that he had drowned.[121] At the time of Hattula's death, no more bodies could be stored in Gacy's crawl space, which leaves a possibility he had disposed of Hattula's body in the Pecatonica River. However, Des Plaines authorities had contacted Freeport during their investigation into Gacy, and were told Hattula had fallen to his death from a bridge. Hattula's death has been officially ruled as asphyxia by drowning.[120]Retired Chicago police officer Bill Dorsch stated he had reason to believe there may be more victims buried in the grounds of the apartment building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago—a property where Gacy is known to have been the caretaker for several years before his 1978 arrest.[235] In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis), holding a shovel in the early hours of the morning. When Dorsch confronted him, Gacy said he was doing work that he was too busy to do during the day. Dorsch also said that several other residents of West Miami Avenue stated they had seen Gacy digging trenches in the grounds of the property in the early to mid-1970s;[236] one of these residents also said that Gacy later placed plants in the elongated trenches he had dug. At the time these actions were observed, Gacy was still married to Carole Hoff.[237]In March 2012, Cook County Sheriff's officials submitted a request to excavate the grounds of this property. The Cook County State's Attorney denied the request, citing a lack of probable cause as the reason, including the results of a 1998 search of the property.[238] However, the sheriff's office noted that in 1998, a radar survey suggested 14 areas of interest within the property grounds, yet only two of these 14 anomalies had been excavated. Of the 12 remaining anomalies, four were described as being "staggeringly suggestive" of human skeletons.[239] Moreover, Bill Dorsch had provided police with a letter from the radar company which confirmed the 1998 search of the grounds was incomplete.[235]A second request to excavate the grounds of West Miami Avenue was submitted to the Cook County State's Attorney by Sheriff Tom Dart in October 2012. This request was granted in January 2013, and a search of the property was conducted in the spring. Both FBI sniffer dogs and ground-penetrating radar equipment were used in the second search of West Miami Avenue; however, the search yielded no human remains.[240][z]
<h2>Potential accomplices</h2>
One of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether "my associates" had been arrested. When questioned whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, "Directly". He later claimed Cram and Rossi were involved in several of the murders.[36] Some criminal defense attorneys and investigators researching the possibility Gacy had not acted alone in several of the murders have said there is "overwhelming evidence Gacy worked with an accomplice".[242]In the 1980s, he informed FBI profiler Robert Ressler that "two or three" PDM employees had assisted in several murders. Ressler believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims in multiple states. Gacy neither confirmed nor denied Ressler's suspicions.[aa][ab]Jeffrey Rignall, who had been assaulted and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant that at one point during his abuse and torture, a young man with brown hair had knelt before him and watched his abuse.[43] Rignall also said that he saw a light come on in another part of the house.[81]On one occasion, three days before his arrest, during their surveillance of Gacy, two officers followed him to a bar where he met two employees—Michael Rossi and Ed Hefner. An anxious Gacy was observed walking with the two out of earshot of the surveillance officers to talk privately before returning closer to the officers. Gacy said to both young men: "You'd better not let me down, you fuckers. You owe it to me." The officers then overheard sections of a hushed conversation between Gacy and the two during which Rossi asked Gacy, "And what? Buried like the other five?"[121]In interviews from death row, Gacy said that at the time of his arrest, three PDM employees were also considered suspects in the murders—all of whom he said were in possession of keys to his house.[80] In addition to Cram and Rossi, Gacy named his former employee Philip Paske, who was known to have been a close associate of firstnameplaceholder Norman and an acquaintance of David Cram. In the late 1970s, Norman operated a nationwide sex trafficking ring based in Chicago known as the Delta Project.[243] At least two victims believed to have been murdered by Gacy, Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino, are known to have last been seen alive close to where Norman lived.[244] This led to the theory Gacy may have been connected to this trafficking ring.[245]Gacy claimed that he was not in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In 2012, two Chicago lawyers said travel records show that Gacy had been in another state at the time of three of the murders, implying he was assisted by one or more accomplices.[246][247] For example, Gacy had flown to Pittsburgh three days before the disappearance of Robert Gilroy, and only returned to Chicago the day after he disappeared.[247][248]Investigators note that Robert Young, the traveling companion with whom victim Russell Nelson was visiting Chicago at the time of his October 1977 disappearance, gave differing accounts of his disappearance to Nelson's family and investigators. Young told Nelson's family he failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time, but had told investigators he had last seen Nelson standing in a crowd that had gathered outside a Chicago bar, and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson had simply disappeared. Investigators contend this could not have happened without Young noticing.[249]Young is known to have filed a missing person's report with Chicago police, before unsuccessfully requesting money from Nelson's parents to finance a search for their son. When Nelson's two brothers arrived in Chicago to search for him, Young offered them a job with PDM.[247] Young was never summoned to testify at Gacy's trial.[249]In a third case, travel records indicate Gacy was at a scheduled job site in Michigan at 6:00 a.m. on September 26, 1977—the day following the disappearance of 19-year-old firstnameplaceholder Mowery, who was last seen leaving his mother's house at 10:00 p.m. on September 25.[247] Mowery's roommate was a PDM employee who formerly lived with Gacy and had moved into Mowery's apartment less than one week before Mowery's disappearance. Two witnesses have stated that this roommate had suggested to Mowery that he meet "a man who is going out of town" two days before Mowery disappeared.[81]
<h2>Notoriety</h2>
In 1984, Sam Amirante, one of Gacy's two defense attorneys at his 1980 trial, authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984. Amirante has since said the primary inspiration for this legislation was that at the time of the Gacy murders, Illinois police had to wait 72 hours before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.[250]The Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed the 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures. As a result, a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known today as an Amber Alert.[250]Isolated in his prison cell, Gacy began to paint. He drew inspiration from a wide range of sources for his artwork, with his paintings depicting subjects as diverse as Christ, birds, skulls, his own home, and firstnameplaceholder Dillinger.[251] Many paintings were of clowns, including himself as Pogo or Patches. His "Hi Ho" series featured scenes of Walt Disney's versions of the Seven Dwarfs. Although Gacy was permitted to earn money from the sale of his paintings until 1985, he claimed his artwork was intended "to bring joy into people's lives".[252]Many of Gacy's paintings have been displayed at exhibitions;[253][254] others have been sold at various auctions, with individual prices ranging between $200 to $20,000.[189] Following Gacy's execution, family members of his victims publicly burned several of his paintings.[255][256]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (now known as Mayrhoff[27]) was born on 9 April 1935, in Amstetten to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Sr. and Maria secondnameplaceholder. He grew up as an only child raised solely by his working mother. His father had deserted the family when secondnameplaceholder was four, and never again came into contact with him. secondnameplaceholder Sr. later fought as a soldier in the Wehrmacht during World War II, and was killed in action in 1944. His name appears on a memorial plaque in Amstetten.[28]In 1956, at the age of 21, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder married Rosemarie, 17, with whom he had two sons and five daughters.After completing his education at an HTL Technical College with a qualification in electrical engineering, secondnameplaceholder obtained a job at Voestalpine in Linz. From 1969 until 1971, he obtained a job in a construction-material firm in Amstetten. Later, he became a technical equipment salesman, travelling throughout Austria. He retired from active employment when he turned 60 in 1995, but continued some commercial activities. In addition to his apartment building in Amstetten, secondnameplaceholder rented out several other properties.[7][1][29][30] In 1972, he purchased a guesthouse and an adjacent campsite at Lake Mondsee. He ran it, together with his wife, until 1996.In 1967, secondnameplaceholder broke into the Linz home of a 24-year-old nurse while her husband was away and raped her while holding a knife to her throat, threatening to kill her if she screamed.[31] According to an annual report for 1967 and a press release of the same year, he was also named as a suspect in a case of attempted rape of a 21-year-old woman, and was known for indecent exposure. secondnameplaceholder was arrested and served twelve months of an eighteen-month prison sentence.[32] In accordance with Austrian law, his criminal record was expunged after fifteen years. As a result, more than 25 years later, when he applied to adopt and/or foster Elisabeth's children, the local social service authorities did not discover his criminal history.[33][34]After his arrest, secondnameplaceholder claimed that his behaviour toward his daughter did not constitute rape but was consensual. Mayer forwarded extracts from the minutes of his talks with his client to the Austrian weekly News for publication. According to these statements, secondnameplaceholder said that he "always knew during the whole 24 years that what I was doing was not right, that I must have been crazy to do such a thing, yet it became a normal occurrence to lead a second life in the basement of my house".Regarding his treatment of the family he had with his wife, secondnameplaceholder stated, "I am not the beast the media make me to be". Regarding his treatment of Elisabeth and her children in the cellar, he explained that he brought flowers for Elisabeth and books and toys for the children into the "bunker", as he called it, and often watched videos with the children and ate meals with Elisabeth and the children. secondnameplaceholder decided to imprison Elisabeth after she "did not adhere to any rules any more" when she became a teenager. "That is why I had to do something; I had to create a place where I could keep Elisabeth, by force if necessary, away from the outside world." He suggested that the emphasis on discipline in the Nazi era, during which he grew up until the age of ten, might have influenced his views about decency and good behaviour. The chief editors of News magazine noted in their editorial that they expected secondnameplaceholder's statement to form the basis of the defence strategy of his lawyer. Critics said his statement may have been a ploy to prepare an insanity defence.[35]Reflecting on his childhood, secondnameplaceholder initially described his mother as "the best woman in the world" and "as strict as it was necessary".[10] Later, he expressed a negative opinion of his mother and claimed that "she used to beat me, hit me until I was lying in a pool of blood on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." He also claimed that she called him "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after secondnameplaceholder had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long secondnameplaceholder kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.[36][37]In a report by forensic psychiatrist Adelheid Kastner, secondnameplaceholder's mother is described as unpredictable and abusive. secondnameplaceholder referred to himself as an "alibi" child, meaning that his mother only gave birth to him to prove that she was not barren and could produce children. secondnameplaceholder claims that his pathological behaviour is innate. During his prison stint for the earlier rape conviction, he admits that he planned to lock his daughter up so that he could contain and express his "evil side". He said, "I was born to rape, and I held myself back for a relatively long time. I could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter."[8] The forensic psychiatrist diagnosed secondnameplaceholder as having a "severe combined personality disorder" which included borderline, schizotypal and schizoid personalities and a sexual disorder and recommended that secondnameplaceholder receive psychiatric care for the rest of his life.[8][38][failed verification]Later reports have revealed secondnameplaceholder's premeditated plan to lock his daughter up was not for discipline but for his own gratification.[8][39]Pursuant to the agreement that she would never have to see her father again, Elisabeth secondnameplaceholder gave videotaped testimony before Austrian prosecutors and investigators on 11 July 2008.[40]On 13 November 2008, authorities in Austria released an indictment against firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. He stood trial for the murder of the infant Michael, who died shortly after birth,[41] and faced between 10 years and life imprisonment. He was also charged with rape, incest, kidnapping, false imprisonment and slavery, which carry a maximum 20-year term.[7]The trial of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder commenced on 16 March 2009, in the city of Sankt Pölten, presided over by Judge Andrea Humer.
<h2>History</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on 9 April 1935, in Amstetten, Austria. In 1956, at age 21, he married 17-year-old Rosemarie (born 23 September 1939), with whom he had three sons and four daughters, including Elisabeth, who was born on 6 April 1966. secondnameplaceholder reportedly began abusing Elisabeth in 1977 when she was 11.[5]After completing compulsory education at age 15, Elisabeth started a course to become a waitress. In January 1983, she ran away from home and went into hiding in Vienna with a friend from work. She was found by police within three weeks and returned to her parents. She rejoined her waitress course, finished it in mid-1984, and was offered a job in nearby Linz.On 28 August 1984, after Elisabeth turned 18, secondnameplaceholder lured her into the basement of the family home by saying that he needed help carrying a door. This was the last piece which secondnameplaceholder needed in order to seal what would turn out to be the chamber where Elisabeth was held captive.[6] After Elisabeth held the door in place while secondnameplaceholder fitted it into the frame, he held an ether-soaked towel on his daughter's face until she was unconscious, then threw her into the chamber.[6]After Elisabeth's disappearance, Rosemarie filed a missing persons report. Almost a month later, secondnameplaceholder handed over a letter to the police, the first of several that he had forced Elisabeth to write while she was in captivity. The letter, postmarked Braunau, stated that Elisabeth was tired of living with her family and was staying with a friend; she warned her parents not to look for her or she would leave the country. secondnameplaceholder told police that she had most likely joined a religious cult.[3]Over the next 24 years, secondnameplaceholder visited Elisabeth in the hidden chamber almost every day, or a minimum of three times a week, bringing food and other supplies. After his arrest, he admitted that he repeatedly raped her. Elisabeth gave birth to seven children during her captivity.[3] One child died shortly after birth, and three—Lisa, Monika, and Alexander—were removed from the cellar as infants to live with secondnameplaceholder and his wife, who were approved by local social services authorities as their foster parents. Officials said that secondnameplaceholder "very plausibly" explained how three of his infant grandchildren had appeared on his doorstep. The family received regular visits from social workers, who saw and heard nothing to arouse their suspicions.[7]Following the fourth child's birth in 1994, secondnameplaceholder allowed the enlargement of the prison, from 35 to 55 m2 (380 to 590 sq ft), putting Elisabeth and her children to work digging out soil with their bare hands for years. The captives had a television, a radio, and a video cassette player. Food could be stored in a refrigerator and cooked or heated on hot plates. Elisabeth taught the children to read and write. At times, secondnameplaceholder would punish them by shutting off their lights or refusing to deliver food to them for days at a time.[8]secondnameplaceholder told Elisabeth and the three children who remained (Kerstin, Stefan, and Felix) that they would be gassed if they tried to escape. Investigators concluded that this was just an empty threat to frighten the victims; there was no gas supply to the basement.[9] He stated after his arrest that he told them that they would receive an electric shock and die if they meddled with the cellar door.[10]According to secondnameplaceholder's sister-in-law Christine, he went into the basement every morning at 09:00, ostensibly to draw plans for machines which he sold to firms. He often stayed there for the night and did not allow his wife to bring him coffee. A tenant who rented a ground-floor room in the house for twelve years claimed to hear noises from the basement, which secondnameplaceholder said were caused by the "faulty pipes" or the gas heating system.[11]On 19 April 2008, secondnameplaceholder agreed to seek medical attention after Kerstin, the eldest daughter, fell unconscious. Elisabeth helped him carry Kerstin out of the chamber and saw the outside world for the first time in 24 years. secondnameplaceholder forced her to return to the chamber, where she remained for a final week.[3] Kerstin was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, the Landesklinikum Amstetten, and was admitted in serious condition with life-threatening kidney failure. secondnameplaceholder later arrived at the hospital claiming to have found a note written by Kerstin's mother. He discussed Kerstin's condition and the note with a doctor, Albert Reiter.[12]Medical staff found aspects of secondnameplaceholder's story puzzling and alerted the police on 21 April, who then broadcast an appeal on public media for the missing mother to come forward and provide additional information about Kerstin's medical history.[13][14] The police reopened the case file on Elisabeth's disappearance. secondnameplaceholder repeated his story about Elisabeth being in a cult, and presented what he claimed was the "most recent letter" from her, dated January 2008, posted from the town of Kematen.[3] The police contacted Manfred Wohlfahrt, a church officer and expert on cults, who raised doubts about the existence of the group secondnameplaceholder described. He noted that Elisabeth's letters seemed dictated and oddly written.Elisabeth pleaded with secondnameplaceholder to be taken to the hospital. On 26 April, he released her from the cellar along with her sons Stefan and Felix, bringing them upstairs. He and Elisabeth went to the hospital where Kerstin was being treated on 26 April 2008. Following a tip-off from Reiter that firstnameplaceholder and Elisabeth were at the hospital, the police detained them on the hospital grounds and took them to a police station for questioning.Elisabeth did not provide police with more details until they promised her that she would never have to see her father again. Over the next two hours, she told the story of her 24 years in captivity. Elisabeth told the police that secondnameplaceholder raped her and forced her to watch pornographic videos, which he made her re-enact with him in front of her children in order to humiliate her.[3] Shortly after midnight, police officers completed the investigation. secondnameplaceholder, aged 73, was arrested on 26 April on suspicion of serious crimes against family members.[15]During the night of 27 April, Elisabeth, her children and her mother Rosemarie were taken into care. Police said secondnameplaceholder told investigators how to enter the basement chamber through a small hidden door, opened by a secret keyless entry code. Rosemarie had been unaware of what had been happening to Elisabeth.On 29 April, it was announced that DNA evidence confirmed secondnameplaceholder as the biological father of his daughter's children.[16] His defence lawyer, Rudolf Mayer, said that although the DNA test proved incest, evidence was still needed for the allegations of rape and enslavement.[17] In their 1 May daily press conference, Austrian police said that secondnameplaceholder had forced Elisabeth to write a letter the previous year indicating that he may have been planning to release her and the children. The letter said that she wanted to come home but "it's not possible yet".[18] Police believe secondnameplaceholder was planning to pretend to have rescued his daughter from her fictitious cult.[19] Police spokesman Franz Polzer said police planned to interview at least 100 people who had lived as tenants in the secondnameplaceholder apartment building in the previous 24 years.[20]
<h2>Cell</h2>
The secondnameplaceholder property in Amstetten is a building dating from around 1890. A newer building was added after 1978 when secondnameplaceholder applied for a building permit for an "extension with basement". In 1983, building inspectors visited the site and verified that the new extension had been built according to the dimensions specified on the permit. secondnameplaceholder had illegally enlarged the room by excavating space for a much larger basement, concealed by walls. Around 1981 or 1982, according to his statement,[10] secondnameplaceholder started to turn this hidden cellar into a prison cell and installed a washbasin, toilet, bed, hot plate, and refrigerator. In 1983, he added more space by creating a passageway to a pre-existing basement area under the old part of the property, of which only he knew.The concealed cellar had a 5-metre-long (16 ft) corridor, a storage area, and three small open cells, connected by narrow passageways; and a basic cooking area and bathroom facilities, followed by two sleeping areas, which were equipped with two beds each. It covered an area of approximately 55 m2 (590 sq ft). The cell had two access points: a hinged door that weighed 500 kg (1,100 lb) which is thought to have become unusable over the years because of its weight, and a metal door, reinforced with concrete and on steel rails that weighed 300 kg (650 lb) and measured 1 m (3.3 ft) high and 60 cm (2 ft) wide. It was located behind a shelf in secondnameplaceholder's basement workshop, protected by an electronic code entered using a remote control unit. In order to reach this door, five locking basement rooms had to be crossed. To get to the area where Elisabeth and her children were held, eight doors in total needed to be unlocked, of which two doors were additionally secured by electronic locking devices.[1][2][21]

The key events are as follows:
<h2>Perpetrator</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (now known as Mayrhoff[27]) was born on 9 April 1935, in Amstetten to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Sr. and Maria secondnameplaceholder. He grew up as an only child raised solely by his working mother. His father had deserted the family when secondnameplaceholder was four, and never again came into contact with him. secondnameplaceholder Sr. later fought as a soldier in the Wehrmacht during World War II, and was killed in action in 1944. His name appears on a memorial plaque in Amstetten.[28]In 1956, at the age of 21, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder married Rosemarie, 17, with whom he had two sons and five daughters.After completing his education at an HTL Technical College with a qualification in electrical engineering, secondnameplaceholder obtained a job at Voestalpine in Linz. From 1969 until 1971, he obtained a job in a construction-material firm in Amstetten. Later, he became a technical equipment salesman, travelling throughout Austria. He retired from active employment when he turned 60 in 1995, but continued some commercial activities. In addition to his apartment building in Amstetten, secondnameplaceholder rented out several other properties.[7][1][29][30] In 1972, he purchased a guesthouse and an adjacent campsite at Lake Mondsee. He ran it, together with his wife, until 1996.In 1967, secondnameplaceholder broke into the Linz home of a 24-year-old nurse while her husband was away and raped her while holding a knife to her throat, threatening to kill her if she screamed.[31] According to an annual report for 1967 and a press release of the same year, he was also named as a suspect in a case of attempted rape of a 21-year-old woman, and was known for indecent exposure. secondnameplaceholder was arrested and served twelve months of an eighteen-month prison sentence.[32] In accordance with Austrian law, his criminal record was expunged after fifteen years. As a result, more than 25 years later, when he applied to adopt and/or foster Elisabeth's children, the local social service authorities did not discover his criminal history.[33][34]After his arrest, secondnameplaceholder claimed that his behaviour toward his daughter did not constitute rape but was consensual. Mayer forwarded extracts from the minutes of his talks with his client to the Austrian weekly News for publication. According to these statements, secondnameplaceholder said that he "always knew during the whole 24 years that what I was doing was not right, that I must have been crazy to do such a thing, yet it became a normal occurrence to lead a second life in the basement of my house".Regarding his treatment of the family he had with his wife, secondnameplaceholder stated, "I am not the beast the media make me to be". Regarding his treatment of Elisabeth and her children in the cellar, he explained that he brought flowers for Elisabeth and books and toys for the children into the "bunker", as he called it, and often watched videos with the children and ate meals with Elisabeth and the children. secondnameplaceholder decided to imprison Elisabeth after she "did not adhere to any rules any more" when she became a teenager. "That is why I had to do something; I had to create a place where I could keep Elisabeth, by force if necessary, away from the outside world." He suggested that the emphasis on discipline in the Nazi era, during which he grew up until the age of ten, might have influenced his views about decency and good behaviour. The chief editors of News magazine noted in their editorial that they expected secondnameplaceholder's statement to form the basis of the defence strategy of his lawyer. Critics said his statement may have been a ploy to prepare an insanity defence.[35]Reflecting on his childhood, secondnameplaceholder initially described his mother as "the best woman in the world" and "as strict as it was necessary".[10] Later, he expressed a negative opinion of his mother and claimed that "she used to beat me, hit me until I was lying in a pool of blood on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." He also claimed that she called him "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after secondnameplaceholder had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long secondnameplaceholder kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.[36][37]In a report by forensic psychiatrist Adelheid Kastner, secondnameplaceholder's mother is described as unpredictable and abusive. secondnameplaceholder referred to himself as an "alibi" child, meaning that his mother only gave birth to him to prove that she was not barren and could produce children. secondnameplaceholder claims that his pathological behaviour is innate. During his prison stint for the earlier rape conviction, he admits that he planned to lock his daughter up so that he could contain and express his "evil side". He said, "I was born to rape, and I held myself back for a relatively long time. I could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter."[8] The forensic psychiatrist diagnosed secondnameplaceholder as having a "severe combined personality disorder" which included borderline, schizotypal and schizoid personalities and a sexual disorder and recommended that secondnameplaceholder receive psychiatric care for the rest of his life.[8][38][failed verification]Later reports have revealed secondnameplaceholder's premeditated plan to lock his daughter up was not for discipline but for his own gratification.[8][39]Pursuant to the agreement that she would never have to see her father again, Elisabeth secondnameplaceholder gave videotaped testimony before Austrian prosecutors and investigators on 11 July 2008.[40]On 13 November 2008, authorities in Austria released an indictment against firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. He stood trial for the murder of the infant Michael, who died shortly after birth,[41] and faced between 10 years and life imprisonment. He was also charged with rape, incest, kidnapping, false imprisonment and slavery, which carry a maximum 20-year term.[7]
<h2>Trial</h2>
The trial of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder commenced on 16 March 2009, in the city of Sankt Pölten, presided over by Judge Andrea Humer.On day one, secondnameplaceholder entered the courtroom attempting to hide his face from cameras behind a blue folder, which he was entitled to do under Austrian law. After opening comments, all journalists and spectators were asked to leave the courtroom, whereupon secondnameplaceholder lowered his binder. secondnameplaceholder pleaded guilty to all charges with the exception of murder and grievous assault by threatening to gas his captives if they disobeyed him.[42]In his opening remarks, Rudolf Mayer, the defending counsel, appealed to the jury to be objective and not be swayed by emotions. He insisted secondnameplaceholder was "not a monster", stating that secondnameplaceholder had brought a Christmas tree down to his captives in the cellar during the holiday season.[26]Christiane Burkheiser, prosecuting her first case since being appointed Chief Prosecutor, pressed for life imprisonment in an institution for the criminally insane. She demonstrated for jurors the low height of the ceiling in the cellar dungeon by making a mark on the door to the courtroom at 1m 74 cm (5 ft 8.5in), and described the cellar as "damp and mouldy", passing around a box of musty objects taken from the cellar, the odour of which made jurors flinch.[43][44]On the first day of testimony, jurors watched eleven hours of testimony recorded by Elisabeth in sessions with police and psychologists in July 2008. The tape is said to have been so "harrowing" that the eight jurors did not watch more than two hours at a time. Four replacement jurors were on standby to replace any of the regular jurors in case they could not bear to hear any more of the evidence.[45]Besides the video testimony, Elisabeth's older brother Harald testified and said that he was physically abused by firstnameplaceholder as a child.[46][47] firstnameplaceholder's wife, Rosemarie, and Elisabeth's children refused to testify.[43]On 18 March 2009, Elisabeth secondnameplaceholder attended the second day of the criminal trial against her father firstnameplaceholder, in preparation for a book she wrote about her ordeal.[48] She did not plan to see her father again.[49] secondnameplaceholder's attorney, Rudolf Mayer, confirmed that she had been in the visitors' gallery in disguise at the time her video testimony was aired. "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder recognised that Elisabeth was in court and, from this point on, you could see firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder going pale and he broke down", Mayer said. "It was a meeting of eyes that changed his mind."[50] The next day, secondnameplaceholder began the proceedings by approaching the judge and changing his pleas to guilty on all charges.[51]On 19 March 2009, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 15 years.[7] He said that he accepted the sentence and would not appeal.[52] secondnameplaceholder is currently serving out his sentence in Garsten Abbey, a former monastery in Upper Austria that has been converted into a prison.[53]Chancellor of Austria Alfred Gusenbauer said he planned to launch a foreign public image campaign for his country, in light of the "abominable events".[54]
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
Judge Humer, who presided over the trial, stated medical experts reported Elisabeth and her children were in "relatively good health".After being taken into care, Elisabeth, all six of her surviving children and her mother were housed in a local clinic where they were shielded from the outside environment and received medical and psychological treatment. Members of the secondnameplaceholder family were offered new identities, but it was emphasized that it was their choice to make.[20]Berthold Kepplinger, head of the clinic where Elisabeth and her children were being treated, said that Elisabeth and the three children held captive in the cellar required further therapy to help them adjust to the light after years in semi-darkness. They also needed treatment to help them cope with all the extra space that they now had in which to move about.[55]In May 2008, a handmade poster created by Elisabeth, her children and her mother at the therapy facility was displayed in the Amstetten town centre. The message thanked local people for their support. "We, the whole family, would like to take the opportunity to thank all of you for sympathy at our fate", they wrote in their message. "Your compassion is helping us greatly to overcome these difficult times, and it shows us there also are good and honest people here who really care for us. We hope that soon there will be a time where we can find our way back into a normal life."[55]Kerstin was reunited with her family on 8 June 2008, when she was awakened from her artificially induced coma. Doctors said that she would make a full recovery.[56]It was revealed that Elisabeth and her children were more traumatized than previously thought. During captivity, Kerstin tore out her hair in clumps, and was reported to have shredded her dresses before stuffing them in the toilet. Stefan could not walk properly, because of his height of 1.73 m (5 ft 8 in), which had forced him to stoop in the 1.68-metre-high (5 ft 6 in) cellar. It has also been revealed that normal everyday occurrences, such as the dimming of lights or the closing of doors, plunge Kerstin and Stefan into anxiety and panic attacks. The other three of Elisabeth's children who were raised by their father are being treated for anger and resentment at the events.[57]In late July 2008, it emerged that Elisabeth ordered her mother Rosemarie out of the villa they had been sharing in a secret location set up for them by a psychiatric clinic. Elisabeth was upset about Rosemarie's passiveness during her upbringing.[58]Lawyer Christoph Herbst, who represents Elisabeth and her family, said, "Fortunately, everything is going very well"; they spend their time answering hundreds of letters from all over the world. Felix, Kerstin, and Stefan, brought up underground with their mother, have learned to swim. All of Elisabeth's children attended a four-day summer camp organised by firefighters, with 4,000 other young campers, in August 2008. The children, along with their mother, also have made day trips, including swimming outings, on which care was taken to keep them out of reach of the paparazzi and to protect their privacy.[59]In March 2009, Elisabeth and her children were forced to move out of the family's hide-away home and returned to the psychiatric clinic where medical staff had started trying to heal the family and unite the "upstairs" and "downstairs" siblings during the previous year. Elisabeth was reported to be distraught and close to a breakdown after a British paparazzo had burst into her kitchen and started taking photographs.[45]After the trial, Elisabeth and her six children were moved to an unnamed village in northern Austria, where they were living in a fortress-like house.[60] All of the children require ongoing therapy. Factors that traumatised the "upstairs" children include learning that firstnameplaceholder had lied to them about their mother abandoning them, the abuse they had received from him during their childhood, and finding out that their siblings had been imprisoned in the cellar. The "downstairs" children receive therapy due to their deprivation from normal development, the lack of fresh air and sunshine while living confined in the basement, and the abuse that they and their mother had received from firstnameplaceholder when he visited them in the basement. All of the children might have genetic problems common to children born of an incestuous relationship.[61] Elisabeth was said to be estranged from her mother, Rosemarie, who accepted firstnameplaceholder's story about Elisabeth joining a cult and did not pursue the matter further, but Elisabeth allows her three children who grew up in firstnameplaceholder and Rosemarie's house to visit their grandmother regularly. Rosemarie lives alone in a small apartment.[61]An article in March 2010 in The Independent stated that Elisabeth and her children recovered remarkably well, given the difficult lives they endured for so long.[62] According to firstnameplaceholder's sister-in-law, Christine, Elisabeth enjoys spending her time shopping, taking frequent showers, and driving. She has passed her driving test without difficulty. Her relationship with Thomas, one of her bodyguards (who is 23 years younger than her),[63] was reported to be ongoing, with him becoming a big-brother figure to her children. All of Elisabeth's children have developed normal sibling relationships with each other, and after having trouble dealing with the traumatic events, the three "upstairs" children slowly began recognising Elisabeth as their mother. The children enjoy being outdoors, playing video games, and spending time with their mother and grandmother. Despite their strained relationship, Elisabeth and her mother Rosemarie started visiting each other more, and Elisabeth has reportedly forgiven her mother for believing her father's story.On 28 June 2013, workers began filling the basement of the secondnameplaceholder home with concrete. Estate liquidator Walter Anzboeck stated that the construction would cost €100,000 and would take a week to complete. The house was to be sold on the open market. While most neighbours approved of the proposal, some preferred that the property be demolished due to its sordid history.[64] Asylum seekers were offered the house to live in.[65] The house was sold for €160,000 in December 2016, with the buyers voicing their intention to convert the building into apartments.[66]In May 2017, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder changed his name to firstnameplaceholder Mayrhoff, probably due to getting into a prison fight that resulted in several of his teeth getting knocked out after other inmates set up a fake dating profile with his name and picture.[67] Mark Perry, a British journalist who interviewed secondnameplaceholder in his cell, says he has shown no remorse for his crimes. He recalls he kept saying "just look into the cellars of other people, you might find other families and girls down there".[68]In April 2019, it was reported that firstnameplaceholder's health was declining and that he did not want to live anymore.[69][70]
<h2>True crime media</h2>
The case was featured in the 2008 documentary, The Longest Night: Secrets of the Austrian Cellar[71] and the 2010 documentary, Monster: The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Story.[72]The 2009 book, The Crimes of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: Uncovering the Truth, by Stefanie Marsh and Bojan Pancevski, is about the case.[73] Room author Emma Donoghue was inspired by the crimes, and her novel inspired a film adaptation with the same name.In 2021, Lifetime released a film inspired by the secondnameplaceholder case titled Girl in the Basement which is part of Lifetime's "Ripped from the Headlines" feature films. The film is directed by Elizabeth Röhm and it stars Stefanie Scott, Judd Nelson, and Joely Fisher.[74]Coordinates: 48°7′3.67″N 14°52′14.90″E﻿ / ﻿48.1176861°N 14.8708056°E﻿ / 48.1176861; 14.8708056﻿ (Location of the secondnameplaceholder house on Ybbsstraße, Amstetten, Austria)

Paul firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (German: [ˈpaʊ̯l ˈjoːzɛf ˈɡœbl̩s] (listen);[1]) (29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician who was the Nazi Gauleiter (district leader) of Berlin, chief propagandist for the Nazi Party, and then Reich Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945. He was one of Adolf Hitler's closest and most devoted acolytes, known for his skills in public speaking and his deeply virulent antisemitism, which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust.secondnameplaceholder, who aspired to be an author, obtained a Doctor of Philology degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1921. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924, and worked with Gregor Strasser in its northern branch. He was appointed Gauleiter of Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, secondnameplaceholder's Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted control over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.In 1943, secondnameplaceholder began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce "total war", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby secondnameplaceholder undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments manufacture and the Wehrmacht.As the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, Magda secondnameplaceholder and the secondnameplaceholder children joined him in Berlin. They moved into the underground Vorbunker, part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April. In accordance with Hitler's will, secondnameplaceholder succeeded him as Chancellor of Germany; he served one day in this post. The following day, secondnameplaceholder and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.
<h2>Early life</h2>
Paul firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on 29 October 1897 in Rheydt, an industrial town south of Mönchengladbach near Düsseldorf, Germany.[2] Both of his parents were Roman Catholics with modest family backgrounds.[2] His father Fritz was a German factory clerk; his mother Katharina Maria (née Odenhausen) was born to Dutch and German parents in the Netherlands.[3] secondnameplaceholder had five siblings: Konrad (1893–1949), Hans (1895–1947), Maria (1896–1896), Elisabeth (1901–1915), and Maria (1910–1949),[2] who married the German filmmaker Max W. Kimmich in 1938.[4] In 1932, secondnameplaceholder published a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his maternal grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.[5]During childhood, secondnameplaceholder suffered from ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot.[2] He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school.[6] secondnameplaceholder wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I because of this deformity.[7]secondnameplaceholder was educated at a Gymnasium, where he completed his Abitur (university entrance examination) in 1917.[8] He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour to speak at the awards ceremony.[9] His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and secondnameplaceholder seriously considered it.[10] He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg, and Munich,[11] aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society.[12] By this time secondnameplaceholder had begun to distance himself from the church.[13]Historians, including Richard J. Evans and Roger Manvell, speculate that secondnameplaceholder' lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disability.[14][15] At Freiburg, he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior.[16] She went on to Würzburg to continue school, as did secondnameplaceholder.[7] In 1921, he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, Michael, a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived.[17] secondnameplaceholder felt he was writing his "own story".[17] Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by secondnameplaceholder shortly before the book was published in 1929 by Eher-Verlag, the publishing house of the Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers' Party; NSDAP).[18] By 1920, the relationship with Anka was over. The break-up filled secondnameplaceholder with thoughts of suicide.[19][a]At the University of Heidelberg, secondnameplaceholder wrote his doctoral thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th-century romantic dramatist.[20] He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of Friedrich Gundolf, a literary historian. It did not seem to bother secondnameplaceholder that Gundolf was Jewish. Gundolf was no longer teaching, so directed secondnameplaceholder to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg, also Jewish, recommended secondnameplaceholder write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, secondnameplaceholder earned his PhD in 1921.[21] By 1940, he had written 14 books.[22]secondnameplaceholder returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing antisemitism and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922, he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher.[23] After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, secondnameplaceholder stated the "enchantment [was] ruined."[24] Nevertheless, he continued to see her on and off until 1927.[25]He continued for several years to try to become a published author.[26] His diaries, which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write.[27] The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold)[28] forced him to take employment as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested.[29][30] He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt.[31] During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany.[32] He also began to study the "social question" and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske.[33][34] According to German historian Peter Longerich, secondnameplaceholder's diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied with "religious-philosophical" issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show secondnameplaceholder was moving towards the Völkisch nationalist movement.[35]

secondnameplaceholder first took an interest in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924.[36] In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of 8–9 November 1923.[37] The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda.[38] Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year.[39] secondnameplaceholder was drawn to the Nazi Party mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs.[40] He joined the Nazi Party around this time, becoming member number 8762.[29] In late 1924, secondnameplaceholder offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was Gauleiter (Nazi Party district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and undertake secretarial work for the regional party offices.[41] He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia.[42] Members of Strasser's northern branch of the Nazi Party, including secondnameplaceholder, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich.[43] Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.[44]Hitler viewed Strasser's actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60 Gauleiters and party leaders, including secondnameplaceholder, to a special conference in Bamberg, in Streicher's Gau of Franconia, where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser's new political programme.[45] Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean "political bolshevization of Germany." Further, there would be "no princes, only Germans," and a legal system with no "Jewish system of exploitation ... for plundering of our people." The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east.[44] secondnameplaceholder was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as "a Jewish creation" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: "I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That's the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away."[46]After reading Hitler's book Mein Kampf, secondnameplaceholder found himself agreeing with Hitler's assertion of a "Jewish doctrine of Marxism".[47] In February 1926, secondnameplaceholder gave a speech titled "Lenin or Hitler?" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a "socialist nationalist state" to arise in Russia.[48] In 1926, secondnameplaceholder published a pamphlet titled Nazi-Sozi which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.[49]In hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr Gau leaders, including secondnameplaceholder.[50] secondnameplaceholder was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening, Hitler and secondnameplaceholder both gave speeches at a beer hall rally.[50] The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them.[51] secondnameplaceholder capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: "I love him ... He has thought through everything," "Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius." He later wrote: "Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius."[52] As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.[52]
<h2>Propagandist in Berlin</h2>
At Hitler's invitation, secondnameplaceholder spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual Party Congress, held in Weimar in 1926.[53] For the following year's event, secondnameplaceholder was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed.[54] Receiving praise for doing well at these events led secondnameplaceholder to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.[55]secondnameplaceholder was first offered the position of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that secondnameplaceholder had served in under Strasser was successful.[56] Hitler gave secondnameplaceholder great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. secondnameplaceholder was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler.[57] The party membership numbered about 1,000 when secondnameplaceholder arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings.[58] Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany.[59] secondnameplaceholder adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues.[60] His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.[61]Like Hitler, secondnameplaceholder practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. secondnameplaceholder usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.[63][62] He used loudspeakers, decorative flames, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.[64]secondnameplaceholder' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the Nazi Party, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the Nazi Party from the city on 5 May 1927.[65][66] Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets.[62] secondnameplaceholder was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October.[67] During this period, he founded the newspaper Der Angriff (The Attack) as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone;[68] 126 libel suits were pending against secondnameplaceholder at one point.[64] To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic.[69] Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police Bernhard Weiß. secondnameplaceholder gave him the derogatory nickname "Isidore" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit.[70] secondnameplaceholder continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book Michael finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (Der Wanderer and Die Saat (The Seed)). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting.[71] During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.[72]The ban on the Nazi Party was lifted before the Reichstag elections on 20 May 1928.[73] The Nazi Party lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote.[74] secondnameplaceholder was one of the first 12 Nazi Party members to gain election to the Reichstag.[74] This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß.[75] The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and secondnameplaceholder was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in Der Angriff over the course of the previous year.[76] secondnameplaceholder continued to be elected to the Reichstag at every subsequent election during the Weimar and Nazi regimes.[77]In his newspaper Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of secondnameplaceholder' failure to attract the urban vote.[78] However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions.[74] This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders.[79] After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector.[80] In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing secondnameplaceholder as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. secondnameplaceholder considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.[81]By 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich.[64] That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by two members of the Communist Party of Germany. He later died in hospital.[84] Exploiting Wessel's death, secondnameplaceholder turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march Die Fahne hoch (Raise the flag), renamed as the Horst-Wessel-Lied, to be the Nazi Party anthem.[82]The Great Depression greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment.[85] During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the Nationaler Sozialist.[86] Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism.[87] secondnameplaceholder complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler, and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be "pushed to the wall".[86] In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed secondnameplaceholder to replace him as Reich leader of Nazi Party propaganda.[88] One of secondnameplaceholder' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the Nationaler Sozialist.[89] secondnameplaceholder was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party's national newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter (People's Observer). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the Nazi Party. Upon receiving the news, secondnameplaceholder was relieved the "crisis" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.[90]The rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and Paul von Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees.[91] He appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor.[92] secondnameplaceholder took charge of the Nazi Party's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and secondnameplaceholder by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.[93]In late 1930 secondnameplaceholder met Magda Quandt, a divorcée who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping secondnameplaceholder organise his private papers.[94] Her flat on the Reichskanzlerplatz soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other Nazi Party officials.[95] secondnameplaceholder and Quandt married on 19 December 1931.[96] Hitler was his best man.[95]For two further elections held in 1932, secondnameplaceholder organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan "the Führer over Germany".[97] secondnameplaceholder wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism.[98] He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on gramophone records and as pamphlets. secondnameplaceholder was also involved in the production of a small collection of silent films that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium.[99][100] Many of secondnameplaceholder' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as "International High Finance".[101] His propaganda characterised the opposition as "November criminals", "Jewish wire-pullers", or a communist threat.[102] Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.[103]To celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, secondnameplaceholder organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring.[104] secondnameplaceholder was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post that secondnameplaceholder was expecting to receive.[105] Like other Nazi Party officials, secondnameplaceholder had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.[106] In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.[107] The Nazi Party took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place.[108] On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War.[109] While the Nazi Party increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership.[110] secondnameplaceholder finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.[111]The role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life.[112] secondnameplaceholder hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the Nazi Party had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population.[113] One of secondnameplaceholder' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March.[114] He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April.[115] Later that month, secondnameplaceholder travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, secondnameplaceholder was declared a local hero.[116]secondnameplaceholder converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the Nazi Party. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run German Labour Front was created to take their place.[117] "We are the masters of Germany," he commented in his diary entry of 3 May.[118] Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the Nazi book burning in Berlin on 10 May,[119] a ceremony he suggested.[64]Meanwhile, the Nazi Party began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service.[120] Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.[120] The first Nazi concentration camps (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power.[121] In a process termed Gleichschaltung (co-ordination), the Nazi Party proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the Nazi Party were the army and the churches.[122] On 2 June 1933, Hitler appointed secondnameplaceholder a Reichsleiter, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party.[123]

In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the Schriftleitergesetz (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press.[124] Modeled to some extent on the system in Benito Mussolini's Italy, the law defined a Schriftleiter as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria.[125] The law required journalists to "regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government."[126]At the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. secondnameplaceholder was present at the arrest of SA leader Ernst Röhm in Munich.[127] On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, secondnameplaceholder announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).[128]The propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic.[129] secondnameplaceholder's style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public.[130] secondnameplaceholder was successful at his job, however; Life wrote in 1938 that "[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department."[131] John Gunther wrote in 1940 that secondnameplaceholder "is the cleverest of all the Nazis", but could not succeed Hitler because "everybody hates him".[132]The Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933.[133] secondnameplaceholder promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages.[134] Under the auspices of the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, secondnameplaceholder added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre.[135] As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced.[136] In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored.[137] Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.[138]secondnameplaceholder was particularly interested in controlling the radio, which was then still a fairly new mass medium.[139] Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly Prussia, headed by Göring), secondnameplaceholder gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934.[140] Manufacturers were urged by secondnameplaceholder to produce inexpensive home receivers, called Volksempfänger (people's receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans.[139] On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), secondnameplaceholder and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty.[141] Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime "made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought."[142]A major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a cult of personality.[143] Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of secondnameplaceholder' propaganda work.[144] Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film Triumph of the Will, one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by Leni Riefenstahl. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 Venice Film Festival.[145] At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, secondnameplaceholder declared that "Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself."[146]secondnameplaceholder was involved in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938.[147] A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by secondnameplaceholder, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.[148] A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year.[149] Meanwhile, secondnameplaceholder was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.[150]In 1933, Hitler signed the Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.[151] However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences.[152][153] secondnameplaceholder widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light.[152] Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.[154][b] Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince secondnameplaceholder to intensify his work on the issue;[155] in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.[156]In response to the persecution, Pope Pius XI had the "Mit brennender Sorge" ("With Burning Concern") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church.[157][158] In response, secondnameplaceholder renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics.[159] His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime.[160] Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.[161]
<h2>World War II</h2>
As early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east.[162] secondnameplaceholder was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, secondnameplaceholder summed up his general attitude in his diary: "[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing."[163] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, secondnameplaceholder took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government.[164] Still, secondnameplaceholder was well aware there was a growing "war panic" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity.[165] After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, secondnameplaceholder soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war.[166] He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.[167]After the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, secondnameplaceholder used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control access to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged secondnameplaceholder' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era.[168] secondnameplaceholder did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.[169]The Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens.[170] Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by secondnameplaceholder and his department.[171][c] The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play.[172] Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans.[173] Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so secondnameplaceholder increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people.[172] From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in Das Reich which were later read aloud over the radio.[174] He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio.[175] At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).[176]secondnameplaceholder became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be.[177] For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front.[177] At the same time, secondnameplaceholder implemented changes to have more "entertaining material" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment.[178] As Gauleiter of Berlin, secondnameplaceholder dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but secondnameplaceholder refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse.[179] Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim.[180] The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won.[181] On 16 November 1942 secondnameplaceholder, like all Gauleiters, was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. This enabled him to issue direct instructions to authorities within his jurisdiction in matters concerning the civilian war effort.[182] On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed secondnameplaceholder as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant secondnameplaceholder was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings.[183] In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local Gauleiters, and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.[184][185]By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Martin Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, secondnameplaceholder, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.[186]Partly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, secondnameplaceholder pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce "total war", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht.[187] Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to secondnameplaceholder' dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available.[188] After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, secondnameplaceholder believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war.[189] His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway.[190] The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well.[191] During the live version of the speech, secondnameplaceholder accidentally begins to mention the "extermination" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.[192]secondnameplaceholder' efforts had little impact for the time being, because Hitler, who in principle was in favour of total war, was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers.[193] The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by secondnameplaceholder in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.[194]
<h2>Plenipotentiary for total war</h2>
On 1 April 1943, secondnameplaceholder was named Stadtpräsident of Berlin, thus uniting under his control the city's highest party and governmental offices.[195] After the Allied invasion of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet victory in the Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), secondnameplaceholder began to recognise that the war could no longer be won.[196] Following the Allied invasion of Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.[197]As Germany's military and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick.[198] Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took the lives of thousands of people.[199] Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact.[200] While secondnameplaceholder' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets.[201] To boost morale, secondnameplaceholder continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war.[202] Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.[203]Throughout July 1944, secondnameplaceholder and Speer continued to press Hitler to bring the economy to a total war footing.[204] The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played into the hands of those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, secondnameplaceholder, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, secondnameplaceholder was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort.[205] Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service.[206] However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer.[207] Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise, the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.[208]At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service – was formed on 18 October 1944.[209] secondnameplaceholder recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. secondnameplaceholder' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.[210][211]secondnameplaceholder realized that his influence would diminish in wartime. He suffered a series of setbacks as propaganda became less important compared to warfare, the war economy, and the Allied bombing of German cities. Historian Michael Balfour states that from 1942 onward, secondnameplaceholder, "lost control over Nazi policy toward the press and over the handling of news in general."[212] Rival agencies expanded. The foreign ministry took charge of propaganda outside Germany.  The military set up its own propaganda division, providing daily reports on the progress of the war and the conditions of the armed forces. The Nazi Party also generated and distributed its own propaganda during the war. secondnameplaceholder was still influential when he had the opportunity to meet with Hitler, who became less available as he moved his headquarters closer to the military front lines. They were together perhaps one day a month. Furthermore, Hitler rarely gave speeches or rallies of the sort that had dominated propaganda in the 1930s. After Hitler returned to Berlin in 1945, secondnameplaceholder' ministry was destroyed by an Allied air raid on 13 March, and secondnameplaceholder had great difficulty disseminating propaganda. In April 1945, he finally bested the rival agencies and took full charge of propaganda, but by then the Soviet Red Army had already entered Berlin. secondnameplaceholder was an astute observer of the war, and historians have exhaustively mined his diary for insights on how the Nazi leadership tried to maintain public morale.[213][214][215]
<h2>Defeat and death</h2>
In the last months of the war, secondnameplaceholder' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone.[216] By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine River, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable.[217] Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery, and even Volkssturm units were in short supply, as almost everything and everyone had been sent to the front.[218] secondnameplaceholder noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward.[219] He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, secondnameplaceholder was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose Hitler's confidence.[220]When other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the National Redoubt in Bavaria, secondnameplaceholder opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin.[221] His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end.[218] He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January.[222] He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime, and had no desire to subject himself to the "debacle" of a trial.[223] He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.[224]secondnameplaceholder knew how to play on Hitler's fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April.[225] Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as secondnameplaceholder proclaimed is not known.[226] By this time, secondnameplaceholder had gained the position he had wanted so long – at the side of Hitler. Göring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April.[227] Himmler, whose appointment as commander of Army Group Vistula had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler.[228] Most of Hitler's inner circle, including Göring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler's birthday celebration on 20 April.[229] Even Bormann was "not anxious" to meet his end at Hitler's side.[230] On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.[231] secondnameplaceholder moved with his family into the Vorbunker, connected to the lower Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day.[232] He told Vice-Admiral Hans-Erich Voss that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape.[233] On 23 April, secondnameplaceholder made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin:After midnight on 29 April, with the Soviets advancing ever closer to the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the Führerbunker.[235][d] Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast.[236] Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament.[237][d] secondnameplaceholder and Bormann were two of the witnesses.[238]In his last will and testament, Hitler named no successor as Führer or leader of the Nazi Party. Instead, he appointed secondnameplaceholder as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, who was at Flensburg near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister.[239] secondnameplaceholder wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would "categorically refuse" to obey Hitler's order to leave Berlin—as he put it, "the first time in my life" that he had not complied with Hitler's orders.[240] He felt compelled to remain with Hitler "for reasons of humanity and personal loyalty".[241] Further, his wife and children would be staying, as well. They would end their lives "side by side with the Führer".[241]In the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself.[242] secondnameplaceholder was depressed, and stated that he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling.[243] Voss later recounted secondnameplaceholder as saying: "It is a great pity that such a man (Hitler) is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example."[244]On 1 May, secondnameplaceholder carried out his sole official act as Chancellor. He dictated a letter to General Vasily Chuikov and ordered German General Hans Krebs to deliver it under a white flag. Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. secondnameplaceholder' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, secondnameplaceholder decided that further efforts were futile.[245]Later on 1 May, Vice-Admiral Voss saw secondnameplaceholder for the last time: "... While saying goodbye I asked secondnameplaceholder to join us. But he replied: 'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine...' "[247] On the evening of 1 May, secondnameplaceholder arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths.[248] According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda secondnameplaceholder and SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.[248]At around 20:30, secondnameplaceholder and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they killed themselves.[249] There are several different accounts of this event. One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards.[250] secondnameplaceholder' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following secondnameplaceholder' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into secondnameplaceholder' body, which did not move.[249][e]The corpses were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried.[250] A few days later, Voss was brought back to the bunker by the Soviets to identify the partly burned bodies of firstnameplaceholder and Magda secondnameplaceholder and their children. The remains of the secondnameplaceholder family, General Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed.[251][252][253] The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains.[254] On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. Those were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.[255]
<h2>Antisemitism and the Holocaust</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was antisemitic from a young age.[256] After joining the Nazi Party and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society.[257] After the Nazis seized control, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews.[258] Despite his extreme antisemitism, secondnameplaceholder spoke of the "rubbish of race-materialism" and of the unnecessity of biological racism for the Nazi ideology.[259] He also described Himmler's ideology as "in many regards, mad" and thought Alfred Rosenberg's theories were ridiculous.[259]The Nazi Party's goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether.[260] In addition to his propaganda efforts, secondnameplaceholder actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and other actions.[261] Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.[262]In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath was killed in Paris by the young Jewish man Herschel Grynszpan. In response, secondnameplaceholder arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech secondnameplaceholder gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.[263] The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.[264]secondnameplaceholder continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which secondnameplaceholder helped to write:[265]While secondnameplaceholder had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry.[267] Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as Riga and Kaunas.[268] In preparation for the deportations, secondnameplaceholder ordered that all German Jews wear an identifying yellow badge as of 5 September 1941.[269] On 6 March 1942, secondnameplaceholder received a copy of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference,[270] which indicated indirectly that the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to extermination camps in occupied areas of Poland and killed.[271] His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. "In general, it can probably be established that 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 per cent can be put to work. ... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved," he wrote on 27 March 1942.[272]secondnameplaceholder had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met.[273] He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He was one of the few top Nazi officials to do so publicly.[274]
<h2>Family life</h2>
Hitler was very fond of Magda secondnameplaceholder and the children.[276] He enjoyed staying at the secondnameplaceholder' Berlin apartment, where he could relax.[277] Magda had a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends.[95] She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.[278]In 1936, secondnameplaceholder met the Czech actress Lída Baarová and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her.[279] Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938.[280] Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that secondnameplaceholder break off the relationship.[281] Thereafter, firstnameplaceholder and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September.[280] The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together.[282] Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October.[283] Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with Kurt Ludecke in 1933[284] and Karl Hanke in 1938.[285]The secondnameplaceholder family included Harald Quandt (Magda's son from her first marriage; born 1921),[286] plus Helga (1932), Hilde (1934), Helmuth (1935), Holde (1937), Hedda (1938), and Heide (1940).[287] Harald was the only member of the family to survive the war.[288]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder Vissarionovich secondnameplaceholder[f] (born Ioseb Besarionis dzе Jughashvili[g]; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878[1] – 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and political leader who ruled the Soviet Union from 1927 until his death in 1953. He served as both General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (1941–1953). Despite initially governing the country as part of a collective leadership, he ultimately consolidated power to become the Soviet Union's dictator by the 1930s. A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, secondnameplaceholder formalised these ideas as Marxism–Leninism while his own policies are known as secondnameplaceholderism.Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), secondnameplaceholder attended the Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary before eventually joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He went on to edit the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the October Revolution and created a one-party state under the newly formed Communist Party in 1917, secondnameplaceholder joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, secondnameplaceholder assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's death in 1924. Under secondnameplaceholder, socialism in one country became a central tenet of the party's dogma. As a result of the Five-Year Plans implemented under his leadership, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. This led to severe disruptions of food production that contributed to the famine of 1932–33. To eradicate accused "enemies of the working class", secondnameplaceholder instituted the Great Purge, in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had absolute control over the party and government.secondnameplaceholder promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, his regime signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite suffering enormous losses and numerous defeats in the early stages of the conflict, the Soviet Red Army ultimately repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, thereby ending World War II in Europe. In the process of defeating Germany and its allies, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and established Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea.By the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers. The ensuing deterioration of relations between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc gave rise to a sustained period of tensions known as the Cold War that lasted until 1989.[2] In the final years of his leadership, secondnameplaceholder presided over the post-war reconstruction of the Soviet Union as well as the development of a Soviet atomic bomb in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign that culminated in the doctors' plot. After secondnameplaceholder's death in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who subsequently denounced his rule and initiated the de-secondnameplaceholderisation of Soviet society.Widely considered to be one of the 20th century's most significant figures, secondnameplaceholder was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, secondnameplaceholder has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union's status as a leading world power. Conversely, his totalitarian regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression, ethnic cleansing, wide-scale deportation, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's birth name was Ioseb Besarionis dzе Jughashvili.[h] He was born in the Georgian town of Gori,[3] then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.[4] He was born on 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878[5][i] and baptised on 29 December.[7] His parents, Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze,[8] were ethnically Georgian, and secondnameplaceholder grew up speaking the Georgian language.[9] He was their only child to survive past infancy[10] and was nicknamed "Soso", a diminutive of "Ioseb".[11]Besarion was a shoemaker who was employed in a workshop owned by another man;[12] it was initially a financial success but later fell into decline,[13] and the family found itself living in poverty.[14] Besarion became an alcoholic[15] and drunkenly beat his wife and son.[16] Ekaterine and secondnameplaceholder left the home by 1883 and began a wandering life, moving through nine different rented rooms over the next decade.[17] In 1886, they moved into the house of a family friend, Father Christopher Charkviani.[18] Ekaterine worked as a house cleaner and launderer and was determined to send her son to school.[19] In September 1888, secondnameplaceholder enrolled at the Gori Church School, a place secured by Charkviani.[20] Although he got into many fights,[21] secondnameplaceholder excelled academically,[22] displaying talent in painting and drama classes,[23] writing his own poetry,[24] and singing as a choirboy.[25] secondnameplaceholder faced several severe health problems: An 1884 smallpox infection left him with facial scars;[26] and at age 12 he was seriously injured when he was hit by a phaeton, likely the cause of a lifelong disability in his left arm.[27]In August 1894, secondnameplaceholder enrolled in the Orthodox Spiritual Seminary in Tiflis, enabled by a scholarship that allowed him to study at a reduced rate.[28] He joined 600 trainee priests who boarded there,[29] and he achieved high grades.[30] He continued writing poetry; five of his poems, on themes such as nature, land and patriotism, were published under the pseudonym of "Soselo" in Ilia Chavchavadze's newspaper Iveria (Georgia).[31] According to secondnameplaceholder's biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, they became "minor Georgian classics"[32] and were included in various anthologies of Georgian poetry over the coming years.[32] As he grew older, secondnameplaceholder lost interest in priestly studies, his grades dropped,[33] and he was repeatedly confined to a cell for his rebellious behaviour.[34] The seminary's journal noted that he declared himself an atheist, stalked out of prayers and refused to doff his hat to monks.[35]secondnameplaceholder joined a forbidden book club at the school;[36] he was particularly influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 pro-revolutionary novel What Is To Be Done?[37] Another influential text was Alexander Kazbegi's The Patricide, with secondnameplaceholder adopting the nickname "Koba" from that of the book's bandit protagonist.[38] He also read Capital, the 1867 book by German sociological theorist Karl Marx.[39] secondnameplaceholder devoted himself to Marx's socio-political theory, Marxism,[40] which was then on the rise in Georgia, one of various forms of socialism opposed to the empire's governing tsarist authorities.[41] At night, he attended secret workers' meetings[42] and was introduced to Silibistro "Silva" Jibladze, the Marxist founder of Mesame Dasi ("Third Group"), a Georgian socialist group.[43] secondnameplaceholder left the seminary in April 1899 and never returned.[44]In October 1899, secondnameplaceholder began work as a meteorologist at the Tiflis observatory.[45] He attracted a group of supporters through his classes in socialist theory[46] and co-organised a secret workers' mass meeting for May Day 1900,[47] at which he successfully encouraged many of the men to take strike action.[48] By this point, the empire's secret police, the Okhrana, were aware of secondnameplaceholder's activities in Tiflis' revolutionary milieu.[48] They attempted to arrest him in March 1901, but he escaped and went into hiding,[49] living off the donations of friends and sympathisers.[50] Remaining underground, he helped plan a demonstration for May Day 1901, in which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities.[51] He continued to evade arrest by using aliases and sleeping in different apartments.[52] In November 1901, he was elected to the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), a Marxist party founded in 1898.[53]That month, secondnameplaceholder travelled to the port city of Batumi.[54] His militant rhetoric proved divisive among the city's Marxists, some of whom suspected that he might be an agent provocateur working for the government.[55] He found employment at the Rothschild refinery storehouse, where he co-organised two workers' strikes.[56] After several strike leaders were arrested, he co-organised a mass public demonstration which led to the storming of the prison; troops fired upon the demonstrators, 13 of whom were killed.[57] secondnameplaceholder organised another mass demonstration on the day of their funeral,[58] before being arrested in April 1902.[59] Held first in Batumi Prison[60] and then Kutaisi Prison,[61] in mid-1903 he was sentenced to three years of exile in eastern Siberia.[62]secondnameplaceholder left Batumi in October, arriving at the small Siberian town of Novaya Uda in late November 1903.[63] There, he lived in a two-room peasant's house, sleeping in the building's larder.[64] He made two escape attempts: On the first, he made it to Balagansk before returning due to frostbite.[65] His second attempt, in January 1904, was successful and he made it to Tiflis.[66] There, he co-edited a Georgian Marxist newspaper, Proletariatis Brdzola ("Proletarian Struggle"), with Philip Makharadze.[67] He called for the Georgian Marxist movement to split from its Russian counterpart, resulting in several RSDLP members accusing him of holding views contrary to the ethos of Marxist internationalism and calling for his expulsion from the party; he soon recanted his opinions.[68] During his exile, the RSDLP had split between Vladimir Lenin's "Bolsheviks" and Julius Martov's "Mensheviks".[69] secondnameplaceholder detested many of the Mensheviks in Georgia and aligned himself with the Bolsheviks.[70] Although he established a Bolshevik stronghold in the mining town of Chiatura,[71] Bolshevism remained a minority force in the Menshevik-dominated Georgian revolutionary scene.[72]In January 1905, government troops massacred protesters in Saint Petersburg. Unrest soon spread across the Russian Empire in what came to be known as the Revolution of 1905.[74] Georgia was particularly affected.[75] secondnameplaceholder was in Baku in February when ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris; at least 2,000 were killed.[76] He publicly lambasted the "pogroms against Jews and Armenians" as being part of Tsar Nicholas II's attempts to "buttress his despicable throne".[77] secondnameplaceholder formed a Bolshevik Battle Squad which he used to try to keep Baku's warring ethnic factions apart; he also used the unrest as a cover for stealing printing equipment.[77] Amid the growing violence throughout Georgia he formed further Battle Squads, with the Mensheviks doing the same.[78] secondnameplaceholder's squads disarmed local police and troops,[79] raided government arsenals,[80] and raised funds through protection rackets on large local businesses and mines.[81] They launched attacks on the government's Cossack troops and pro-Tsarist Black Hundreds,[82] co-ordinating some of their operations with the Menshevik militia.[83]In November 1905, the Georgian Bolsheviks elected secondnameplaceholder as one of their delegates to a Bolshevik conference in Saint Petersburg.[84] On arrival, he met Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, who informed him that the venue had been moved to Tampere in the Grand Duchy of Finland.[85] At the conference secondnameplaceholder met Lenin for the first time.[86] Although secondnameplaceholder held Lenin in deep respect, he was vocal in his disagreement with Lenin's view that the Bolsheviks should field candidates for the forthcoming election to the State Duma; secondnameplaceholder saw the parliamentary process as a waste of time.[87] In April 1906, secondnameplaceholder attended the RSDLP Fourth Congress in Stockholm; this was his first trip outside the Russian Empire.[88] At the conference, the RSDLP — then led by its Menshevik majority — agreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery.[89] Lenin and secondnameplaceholder disagreed with this decision[90] and later privately discussed how they could continue the robberies for the Bolshevik cause.[91]secondnameplaceholder married Kato Svanidze in a church ceremony at Senaki in July 1906.[92] In March 1907 she bore a son, Yakov.[93] By that year — according to the historian Robert Service — secondnameplaceholder had established himself as "Georgia's leading Bolshevik".[94] He attended the Fifth RSDLP Congress, held in London in May–June 1907.[95] After returning to Tiflis, secondnameplaceholder organised the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank in June 1907. His gang ambushed the armed convoy in Yerevan Square with gunfire and home-made bombs. Around 40 people were killed, but all of his gang escaped alive.[96] After the heist, secondnameplaceholder settled in Baku with his wife and son.[97] There, Mensheviks confronted secondnameplaceholder about the robbery and voted to expel him from the RSDLP, but he took no notice of them.[98]In Baku, secondnameplaceholder secured Bolshevik domination of the local RSDLP branch[99] and edited two Bolshevik newspapers, Bakinsky Proletary and Gudok ("Whistle").[100] In August 1907, he attended the Seventh Congress of the Second International — an international socialist organisation — in Stuttgart, Germany.[101] In November 1907, his wife died of typhus,[102] and he left his son with her family in Tiflis.[103] In Baku he had reassembled his gang, the Outfit,[104] which continued to attack Black Hundreds and raised finances by running protection rackets, counterfeiting currency, and carrying out robberies.[105] They also kidnapped the children of several wealthy figures to extract ransom money.[106] In early 1908, he travelled to the Swiss city of Geneva to meet with Lenin and the prominent Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov, although the latter exasperated him.[107]In March 1908, secondnameplaceholder was arrested and interned in Bailov Prison in Baku.[108] There he led the imprisoned Bolsheviks, organised discussion groups, and ordered the killing of suspected informants.[109] He was eventually sentenced to two years exile in the village of Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province, arriving there in February 1909.[110] In June, he escaped the village and made it to Kotlas disguised as a woman and from there to Saint Petersburg.[111] In March 1910, he was arrested again and sent back to Solvychegodsk.[112] There he had affairs with at least two women; his landlady, Maria Kuzakova, later gave birth to his second son, Konstantin.[113] In June 1911, secondnameplaceholder was given permission to move to Vologda, where he stayed for two months,[114] having a relationship with Pelageya Onufrieva.[115] He escaped to Saint Petersburg,[116] where he was arrested in September 1911 and sentenced to a further three-year exile in Vologda.[117]In January 1912, while secondnameplaceholder was in exile, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference.[118] Shortly after the conference, Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt secondnameplaceholder to the committee.[118] Still in Vologda, secondnameplaceholder agreed, remaining a Central Committee member for the rest of his life.[119] Lenin believed that secondnameplaceholder, as a Georgian, would help secure support for the Bolsheviks from the empire's minority ethnicities.[120] In February 1912, secondnameplaceholder again escaped to Saint Petersburg,[121] tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda ("Star") into a daily, Pravda ("Truth").[122] The new newspaper was launched in April 1912,[123] although secondnameplaceholder's role as editor was kept secret.[123]In May 1912, he was arrested again and imprisoned in the Shpalerhy Prison, before being sentenced to three years exile in Siberia.[124] In July, he arrived at the Siberian village of Narym,[125] where he shared a room with a fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov.[126] After two months, secondnameplaceholder and Sverdlov escaped back to Saint Petersburg.[127]
During a brief period back in Tiflis, secondnameplaceholder and the Outfit planned the ambush of a mail coach, during which most of the group — although not secondnameplaceholder — were apprehended by the authorities.[128] secondnameplaceholder returned to Saint Petersburg, where he continued editing and writing articles for Pravda.[129]After the October 1912 Duma elections, where six Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks were elected, secondnameplaceholder wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the two Marxist factions, for which Lenin criticised him.[130] In late 1912, secondnameplaceholder twice crossed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire to visit Lenin in Kraków,[131] eventually bowing to Lenin's opposition to reunification with the Mensheviks.[132] In January 1913, secondnameplaceholder travelled to Vienna,[133] where he researched the 'national question' of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Russian Empire's national and ethnic minorities.[134] Lenin, who encouraged secondnameplaceholder to write an article on the subject,[135] wanted to attract those groups to the Bolshevik cause by offering them the right of secession from the Russian state, but also hoped they would remain part of a future Bolshevik-governed Russia.[136]secondnameplaceholder's article Marxism and the National Question[137] was first published in the March, April, and May 1913 issues of the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye;[138] Lenin was pleased with it.[139] According to Montefiore, this was "secondnameplaceholder's most famous work".[136] The article was published under the pseudonym "K. secondnameplaceholder",[139] a name he had used since 1912.[140] Derived from the Russian word for steel (stal),[141] this has been translated as "Man of Steel";[142] secondnameplaceholder may have intended it to imitate Lenin's pseudonym.[143] secondnameplaceholder retained the name for the rest of his life, possibly because it was used on the article that established his reputation among the Bolsheviks.[144]In February 1913, secondnameplaceholder was arrested while back in Saint Petersburg.[145] He was sentenced to four years exile in Turukhansk, a remote part of Siberia from which escape was particularly difficult.[146] In August, he arrived in the village of Monastyrskoe, although after four weeks was relocated to the hamlet of Kostino.[147] In March 1914, concerned over a potential escape attempt, the authorities moved secondnameplaceholder to the hamlet of Kureika on the edge of the Arctic Circle.[148] In the hamlet, secondnameplaceholder had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygia, who was thirteen at the time and thus a year under the legal age of consent in Tsarist Russia.[149] In or about December 1914, Pereprygia gave birth to secondnameplaceholder's child, although the infant soon died.[150] She gave birth to another of his children, Alexander, circa April 1917.[151][152]In Kureika, secondnameplaceholder lived closely with the indigenous Tunguses and Ostyak,[153] and spent much of his time fishing.[154]While secondnameplaceholder was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 secondnameplaceholder and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army, leaving for Monastyrskoe.[155] They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917,[156] where a medical examiner ruled secondnameplaceholder unfit for military service because of his crippled arm.[157] secondnameplaceholder was required to serve four more months on his exile, and he successfully requested that he serve it in nearby Achinsk.[158] secondnameplaceholder was in the city when the February Revolution took place; uprisings broke out in Petrograd — as Saint Petersburg had been renamed — and Tsar Nicholas II abdicated to escape being violently overthrown. The Russian Empire became a de facto republic, headed by a Provisional Government dominated by liberals.[159] In a celebratory mood, secondnameplaceholder travelled by train to Petrograd in March.[160] There, secondnameplaceholder and a fellow Bolshevik Lev Kamenev assumed control of Pravda,[161] and secondnameplaceholder was appointed the Bolshevik representative to the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential council of the city's workers.[162] In April, secondnameplaceholder came third in the Bolshevik elections for the party's Central Committee; Lenin came first and Zinoviev came second.[163] This reflected his senior standing in the party at the time.[164]secondnameplaceholder helped organise the July Days uprising, an armed display of strength by Bolshevik supporters.[166] After the demonstration was suppressed, the Provisional Government initiated a crackdown on the Bolsheviks, raiding Pravda.[167] During this raid, secondnameplaceholder smuggled Lenin out of the newspaper's office and took charge of the Bolshevik leader's safety, moving him between Petrograd safe houses before smuggling him to Razliv.[168] In Lenin's absence, secondnameplaceholder continued editing Pravda and served as acting leader of the Bolsheviks, overseeing the party's Sixth Congress, which was held covertly.[169] Lenin began calling for the Bolsheviks to seize power by toppling the Provisional Government in a coup d'état. secondnameplaceholder and a fellow senior Bolshevik Leon Trotsky both endorsed Lenin's plan of action, but it was initially opposed by Kamenev and other party members.[170] Lenin returned to Petrograd and secured a majority in favour of a coup at a meeting of the Central Committee on 10 October.[171]On 24 October, police raided the Bolshevik newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses; secondnameplaceholder salvaged some of this equipment to continue his activities.[172] In the early hours of 25 October, secondnameplaceholder joined Lenin in a Central Committee meeting in the Smolny Institute, from where the Bolshevik coup — the October Revolution — was directed.[173] Bolshevik militia seized Petrograd's electric power station, main post office, state bank, telephone exchange, and several bridges.[174] A Bolshevik-controlled ship, the Aurora, opened fire on the Winter Palace; the Provisional Government's assembled delegates surrendered and were arrested by the Bolsheviks.[175] Although he had been tasked with briefing the Bolshevik delegates of the Second Congress of Soviets about the developing situation, secondnameplaceholder's role in the coup had not been publicly visible.[176] Trotsky and other later Bolshevik opponents of secondnameplaceholder used this as evidence that his role in the coup had been insignificant, although later historians reject this.[177] According to the historian Oleg Khlevniuk, secondnameplaceholder "filled an important role [in the October Revolution]... as a senior Bolshevik, member of the party's Central Committee, and editor of its main newspaper";[178] the historian Stephen Kotkin similarly noted that secondnameplaceholder had been "in the thick of events" in the build-up to the coup.[179]
<h2>In Lenin's government</h2>
On 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of a new government, the Council of People's Commissars ("Sovnarkom").[180] secondnameplaceholder backed Lenin's decision not to form a coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party, although they did form a coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.[181] secondnameplaceholder became part of an informal foursome leading the government, alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov;[182] of these, Sverdlov was regularly absent and died in March 1919.[183] secondnameplaceholder's office was based near to Lenin's in the Smolny Institute,[184] and he and Trotsky were the only individuals allowed access to Lenin's study without an appointment.[185] Although not so publicly well known as Lenin or Trotsky,[186] secondnameplaceholder's importance among the Bolsheviks grew.[187] He co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers,[188] and along with Sverdlov, he chaired the sessions of the committee drafting a constitution for the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.[189] He strongly supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the subsequent Red Terror that it initiated; noting that state violence had proved an effective tool for capitalist powers, he believed that it would prove the same for the Soviet government.[190] Unlike senior Bolsheviks like Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, secondnameplaceholder never expressed concern about the rapid growth and expansion of the Cheka and Red Terror.[190]Having dropped his editorship of Pravda,[191] secondnameplaceholder was appointed the People's Commissar for Nationalities.[192] He took Nadezhda Alliluyeva as his secretary[193] and at some point married her, although the wedding date is unknown.[194] In November 1917, he signed the Decree on Nationality, according ethnic and national minorities living in Russia the right of secession and self-determination.[195] The decree's purpose was primarily strategic; the Bolsheviks wanted to gain favour among ethnic minorities but hoped that the latter would not actually desire independence.[196] That month, he travelled to Helsinki to talk with the Finnish Social-Democrats, granting Finland's request for independence in December.[196] His department allocated funds for establishment of presses and schools in the languages of various ethnic minorities.[197] Socialist revolutionaries accused secondnameplaceholder's talk of federalism and national self-determination as a front for Sovnarkom's centralising and imperialist policies.[189]Because of the ongoing First World War, in which Russia was fighting the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary, Lenin's government relocated from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918. secondnameplaceholder, Trotsky, Sverdlov, and Lenin lived at the Kremlin.[198] secondnameplaceholder supported Lenin's desire to sign an armistice with the Central Powers regardless of the cost in territory.[199] secondnameplaceholder thought it necessary because — unlike Lenin — he was unconvinced that Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution.[200] Lenin eventually convinced the other senior Bolsheviks of his viewpoint, resulting in signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918.[201] The treaty gave vast areas of land and resources to the Central Powers and angered many in Russia; the Left Socialist Revolutionaries withdrew from the coalition government over the issue.[202] The governing RSDLP party was soon renamed, becoming the Russian Communist Party.[203]After the Bolsheviks seized power, both right and left-wing armies rallied against them, generating the Russian Civil War.[204] To secure access to the dwindling food supply, in May 1918 Sovnarkom sent secondnameplaceholder to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in southern Russia.[205] Eager to prove himself as a commander,[206] once there he took control of regional military operations.[207] He befriended two military figures, Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who would form the nucleus of his military and political support base.[208] Believing that victory was assured by numerical superiority, he sent large numbers of Red Army troops into battle against the region's anti-Bolshevik White armies, resulting in heavy losses; Lenin was concerned by this costly tactic.[209] In Tsaritsyn, secondnameplaceholder commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, sometimes without trial[210] and — in contravention of government orders — purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, some of whom he also executed.[211] His use of state violence and terror was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of;[212] for instance, he ordered several villages to be torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program.[213]In December 1918, secondnameplaceholder was sent to Perm to lead an inquiry into how Alexander Kolchak's White forces had been able to decimate Red troops based there.[214] He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919,[215] before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd.[216] When the Red Third Regiment defected, he ordered the public execution of captured defectors.[215] In September he was returned to the Southern Front.[215] During the war, he proved his worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, and willingness to take on responsibility in conflict situations.[206] At the same time, he disregarded orders and repeatedly threatened to resign when affronted.[217] He was reprimanded by Lenin at the 8th Party Congress for employing tactics which resulted in far too many deaths of Red Army soldiers.[218] In November 1919, the government nonetheless awarded him the Order of the Red Banner for his wartime service.[219]The Bolsheviks won the Russian civil war by the end of 1919.[220] By that time, Sovnarkom had turned its attention to spreading proletarian revolution abroad, to this end forming the Communist International in March 1919; secondnameplaceholder attended its inaugural ceremony.[221] Although secondnameplaceholder did not share Lenin's belief that Europe's proletariat were on the verge of revolution, he acknowledged that as long as it stood alone, Soviet Russia remained vulnerable.[222] In December 1918, he drew up decrees recognising Marxist-governed Soviet republics in Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia;[223] during the civil war these Marxist governments were overthrown and the Baltic countries became fully independent of Russia, an act secondnameplaceholder regarded as illegitimate.[224] In February 1920, he was appointed to head the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate;[225] that same month he was also transferred to the Caucasian Front.[226]Following earlier clashes between Polish and Russian troops, the Polish–Soviet War broke out in early 1920, with the Poles invading Ukraine and taking Kyiv on 7 May.[227] On 26 May, secondnameplaceholder was moved to Ukraine, on the Southwest Front.[228] The Red Army retook Kyiv on 10 June and soon forced the Polish troops back into Poland.[229] On 16 July, the Central Committee decided to take the war into Polish territory.[230] Lenin believed that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russians against Józef Piłsudski's Polish government.[230] secondnameplaceholder had cautioned against this; he believed that nationalism would lead the Polish working-classes to support their government's war effort.[230] He also believed that the Red Army was ill-prepared to conduct an offensive war and that it would give White Armies a chance to resurface in Crimea, potentially reigniting the civil war.[230] secondnameplaceholder lost the argument, after which he accepted Lenin's decision and supported it.[226] Along the Southwest Front, he became determined to conquer Lviv; in focusing on this goal he disobeyed orders in early August to transfer his troops to assist Mikhail Tukhachevsky's forces that were attacking Warsaw.[231]In mid-August 1920, the Poles repulsed the Russian advance, and secondnameplaceholder returned to Moscow to attend the Politburo meeting.[232] In Moscow, Lenin and Trotsky blamed him for his behavior in the Polish–Soviet war.[233] secondnameplaceholder felt humiliated and under-appreciated; on 17 August, he demanded demission from the military, which was granted on 1 September.[234] At the 9th Bolshevik Conference in late September, Trotsky accused secondnameplaceholder of "strategic mistakes" in his handling of the war.[235] Trotsky claimed that secondnameplaceholder sabotaged the campaign by disobeying troop transfer orders.[236] Lenin joined Trotsky in criticising him, and nobody spoke on his behalf at the conference.[237] secondnameplaceholder felt disgraced and increased his antipathy toward Trotsky.[218] The Polish-Soviet War ended on 18 March 1921, when a peace treaty was signed in Riga.[238]The Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia,[239] while in April 1921, secondnameplaceholder ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Russian state control.[240] As People's Commissar for Nationalities, secondnameplaceholder believed that each national and ethnic group should have the right to self-expression,[241] facilitated through "autonomous republics" within the Russian state in which they could oversee various regional affairs.[242] In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russocentric by seeking to retain these nations within the Russian state.[241]secondnameplaceholder's native Caucasus posed a particular problem because of its highly multi-ethnic mix.[243] secondnameplaceholder opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani autonomous republics, arguing that these would likely oppress ethnic minorities within their respective territories; instead he called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.[244] The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian affair.[245] In mid-1921, secondnameplaceholder returned to the southern Caucasus, there calling on Georgian Communists to avoid the chauvinistic Georgian nationalism which marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities in Georgia.[246] On this trip, secondnameplaceholder met with his son Yakov, and brought him back to Moscow;[247] Nadezhda had given birth to another of secondnameplaceholder's sons, Vasily, in March 1921.[247]After the civil war, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across Russia, largely in opposition to Sovnarkom's food requisitioning project; as an antidote, Lenin introduced market-oriented reforms: the New Economic Policy (NEP).[248] There was also internal turmoil in the Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed this, and secondnameplaceholder helped rally opposition to Trotsky's position.[249] secondnameplaceholder also agreed to supervise the Department of Agitation and Propaganda in the Central Committee Secretariat.[250] At the 11th Party Congress in 1922, Lenin nominated secondnameplaceholder as the party's new General Secretary. Although concerns were expressed that adopting this new post on top of his others would overstretch his workload and give him too much power, secondnameplaceholder was appointed to the position.[251] For Lenin, it was advantageous to have a key ally in this crucial post.[252]In May 1922, a massive stroke left Lenin partially paralyzed.[255] Residing at his Gorki dacha, Lenin's main connection to Sovnarkom was through secondnameplaceholder, who was a regular visitor.[256] Lenin twice asked secondnameplaceholder to procure poison so that he could commit suicide, but secondnameplaceholder never did so.[257] Despite this comradeship, Lenin disliked what he referred to as secondnameplaceholder's "Asiatic" manner and told his sister Maria that secondnameplaceholder was "not intelligent".[258] Lenin and secondnameplaceholder argued on the issue of foreign trade; Lenin believed that the Soviet state should have a monopoly on foreign trade, but secondnameplaceholder supported Grigori Sokolnikov's view that doing so was impractical at that stage.[259] Another disagreement came over the Georgian affair, with Lenin backing the Georgian Central Committee's desire for a Georgian Soviet Republic over secondnameplaceholder's idea of a Transcaucasian one.[260]They also disagreed on the nature of the Soviet state. Lenin called for establishment of a new federation named the "Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia", reflecting his desire for expansion across the two continents and insisted that the Russian state should join this union on equal terms with the other Soviet states.[261] secondnameplaceholder believed this would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians, instead arguing that ethnic minorities would be content as "autonomous republics" within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.[262] Lenin accused secondnameplaceholder of "Great Russian chauvinism"; secondnameplaceholder accused Lenin of "national liberalism".[263] A compromise was reached, in which the federation would be renamed the "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" (USSR).[261] The USSR's formation was ratified in December 1922; although officially a federal system, all major decisions were taken by the governing Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow.[264]Their differences also became personal; Lenin was particularly angered when secondnameplaceholder was rude to his wife Krupskaya during a telephone conversation.[265] In the final years of his life, Krupskaya provided governing figures with Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about secondnameplaceholder. These criticised secondnameplaceholder's rude manners and excessive power, suggesting that secondnameplaceholder should be removed from the position of general secretary.[266] Some historians have questioned whether Lenin ever produced these, suggesting instead that they may have been written by Krupskaya, who had personal differences with secondnameplaceholder;[254] secondnameplaceholder, however, never publicly voiced concerns about their authenticity.[267]
<h2>Consolidation of power</h2>
Lenin died in January 1924.[268] secondnameplaceholder took charge of the funeral and was one of its pallbearers; against the wishes of Lenin's widow, the Politburo embalmed his corpse and placed it within a mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square.[269] It was incorporated into a growing personality cult devoted to Lenin, with Petrograd being renamed "Leningrad" that year.[270] To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist, secondnameplaceholder gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the "Foundations of Leninism", later published in book form.[271] During the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, "Lenin's Testament" was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations.[272] Embarrassed by its contents, secondnameplaceholder offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him and he was retained in the position.[273]As General Secretary, secondnameplaceholder had a free hand in making appointments to his own staff, implanting his loyalists throughout the party and administration.[274] Favouring new Communist Party members, many from worker and peasant backgrounds, to the "Old Bolsheviks" who tended to be university educated,[275] he ensured he had loyalists dispersed across the country's regions.[276] secondnameplaceholder had much contact with young party functionaries,[277] and the desire for promotion led many provincial figures to seek to impress secondnameplaceholder and gain his favour.[278] secondnameplaceholder also developed close relations with the trio at the heart of the secret police (first the Cheka and then its replacement, the State Political Directorate): Felix Dzerzhinsky, Genrikh Yagoda, and Vyacheslav Menzhinsky.[279] In his private life, he divided his time between his Kremlin apartment and a dacha at Zubalova;[280] his wife gave birth to a daughter, Svetlana, in February 1926.[281]In the wake of Lenin's death, various protagonists emerged in the struggle to become his successor: alongside secondnameplaceholder was Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky.[282] secondnameplaceholder saw Trotsky — whom he personally despised[283] — as the main obstacle to his dominance within the party.[284] While Lenin had been ill secondnameplaceholder had forged an anti-Trotsky alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev.[285] Although Zinoviev was concerned about secondnameplaceholder's growing authority, he rallied behind him at the 13th Congress as a counterweight to Trotsky, who now led a party faction known as the Left Opposition.[286] The Left Opposition believed the NEP conceded too much to capitalism; secondnameplaceholder was called a "rightist" for his support of the policy.[287] secondnameplaceholder built up a retinue of his supporters in the Central Committee,[288] while the Left Opposition were gradually removed from their positions of influence.[289] He was supported in this by Bukharin, who, like secondnameplaceholder, believed that the Left Opposition's proposals would plunge the Soviet Union into instability.[290]In late 1924, secondnameplaceholder moved against Kamenev and Zinoviev, removing their supporters from key positions.[291] In 1925, the two moved into open opposition to secondnameplaceholder and Bukharin.[292] At the 14th Party Congress in December, they launched an attack against secondnameplaceholder's faction, but it was unsuccessful.[293] secondnameplaceholder in turn accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of reintroducing factionalism — and thus instability — into the party.[293] In mid-1926, Kamenev and Zinoviev joined with Trotsky's supporters to form the United Opposition against secondnameplaceholder;[294] in October they agreed to stop factional activity under threat of expulsion, and later publicly recanted their views under secondnameplaceholder's command.[295] The factionalist arguments continued, with secondnameplaceholder threatening to resign in October and then December 1926 and again in December 1927.[296] In October 1927, Zinoviev and Trotsky were removed from the Central Committee;[297] the latter was exiled to Kazakhstan and later deported from the country in 1929.[298] Some of those United Opposition members who were repentant were later rehabilitated and returned to government.[299]secondnameplaceholder was now the party's supreme leader,[300] although he was not the head of government, a task he entrusted to his key ally Vyacheslav Molotov.[301] Other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze,[302] with secondnameplaceholder ensuring his allies ran the various state institutions.[303] According to Montefiore, at this point "secondnameplaceholder was the leader of the oligarchs but he was far from a dictator".[304] His growing influence was reflected in naming of various locations after him; in June 1924 the Ukrainian mining town of Yuzovka became secondnameplaceholdero,[305] and in April 1925, Tsaritsyn was renamed secondnameplaceholdergrad on the order of Mikhail Kalinin and Avel Enukidze.[306]In 1926, secondnameplaceholder published On Questions of Leninism.[307] Here, he argued for the concept of "Socialism in One Country", which he presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective. It nevertheless clashed with established Bolshevik views that socialism could not be established in one country but could only be achieved globally through the process of world revolution.[307] In 1927, there was some argument in the party over Soviet policy regarding China. secondnameplaceholder had called for the Chinese Communists to ally themselves with Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists, viewing a Communist-Kuomintang alliance as the best bulwark against Japanese imperial expansionism. Instead, the KMT repressed the Communists and a civil war broke out between the two sides.[308]The Soviet Union lagged behind the industrial development of Western countries,[310] and there had been a shortfall of grain; 1927 produced only 70% of grain produced in 1926.[311] secondnameplaceholder's government feared attack from Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Romania.[312] Many Communists, including in Komsomol, OGPU, and the Red Army, were eager to be rid of the NEP and its market-oriented approach;[313] they had concerns about those who profited from the policy: affluent peasants known as "kulaks" and small business owners or "Nepmen".[314] At this point, secondnameplaceholder turned against the NEP, which put him on a course to the "left" even of Trotsky or Zinoviev.[315]In early 1928 secondnameplaceholder travelled to Novosibirsk, where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding their grain and ordered that the kulaks be arrested and their grain confiscated, with secondnameplaceholder bringing much of the area's grain back to Moscow with him in February.[316] At his command, grain procurement squads surfaced across Western Siberia and the Urals, with violence breaking out between these squads and the peasantry.[317] secondnameplaceholder announced that both kulaks and the "middle peasants" must be coerced into releasing their harvest.[318] Bukharin and several other Central Committee members were angry that they had not been consulted about this measure, which they deemed rash.[319] In January 1930, the Politburo approved the liquidation of the kulak class; accused kulaks were rounded up and exiled to other parts of the country or to concentration camps.[320] Large numbers died during the journey.[321] By July 1930, over 320,000 households had been affected by the de-kulakisation policy.[320] According to secondnameplaceholder biographer Dmitri Volkogonov, de-kulakisation was "the first mass terror applied by secondnameplaceholder in his own country."[322]In 1929, the Politburo announced the mass collectivisation of agriculture,[324] establishing both kolkhozy collective farms and sovkhoz state farms.[325] secondnameplaceholder barred kulaks from joining these collectives.[326] Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined the collectives out of fear they would face the fate of the kulaks; others joined amid intimidation and violence from party loyalists.[327] By 1932, about 62% of households involved in agriculture were part of collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%.[328] Many of the collectivised peasants resented the loss of their private farmland,[329] and productivity slumped.[330] Famine broke out in many areas,[331] with the Politburo frequently ordering distribution of emergency food relief to these regions.[332]Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation broke out in Ukraine, northern Caucasus, southern Russia, and central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were suppressed by the Red Army.[333] secondnameplaceholder responded to the uprisings with an article insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming any violence and other excesses on local officials.[334] Although he and secondnameplaceholder had been close for many years,[335] Bukharin expressed concerns about these policies; he regarded them as a return to Lenin's old "war communism" policy and believed that it would fail. By mid-1928 he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms.[336] In November 1929 secondnameplaceholder removed him from the Politburo.[337]Officially, the Soviet Union had replaced the "irrationality" and "wastefulness" of a market economy with a planned economy organised along a long-term, precise, and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on ad hoc commandments issued from the centre, often to make short-term targets.[338] In 1928, the first five-year plan was launched, its main focus on boosting heavy industry;[339] it was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932.[340] The USSR underwent a massive economic transformation.[341] New mines were opened, new cities like Magnitogorsk constructed, and work on the White Sea-Baltic Canal began.[341] Millions of peasants moved to the cities, although urban house building could not keep up with the demand.[341] Large debts were accrued purchasing foreign-made machinery.[342]Many of major construction projects, including the White Sea-Baltic Canal and the Moscow Metro, were constructed largely through forced labour.[343] The last elements of workers' control over industry were removed, with factory managers increasing their authority and receiving privileges and perks;[344] secondnameplaceholder defended wage disparity by pointing to Marx's argument that it was necessary during the lower stages of socialism.[345] To promote intensification of labour, a series of medals and awards as well as the Stakhanovite movement were introduced.[323] secondnameplaceholder's message was that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling amid the Wall Street crash.[346] His speeches and articles reflected his utopian vision of the Soviet Union rising to unparalleled heights of human development, creating a "new Soviet person".[347]In 1928, secondnameplaceholder declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed.[348] He warned of a "danger from the right", including in the Communist Party itself.[349] The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1928, in which several middle-class "industrial specialists" were convicted of sabotage.[350] From 1929 to 1930, further show trials were held to intimidate opposition:[351] these included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial.[352] Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian,[353] he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state hierarchy and made the Russian language compulsory throughout schools and offices, albeit to be used in tandem with local languages in areas with non-Russian majorities.[354] Nationalist sentiment among ethnic minorities was suppressed.[355] Conservative social policies were promoted to enhance social discipline and boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units and motherhood, re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions placed on abortion and divorce, and abolition of the Zhenotdel women's department.[356]secondnameplaceholder desired a "cultural revolution",[357] entailing both creation of a culture for the "masses" and wider dissemination of previously elite culture.[358] He oversaw proliferation of schools, newspapers, and libraries, as well as advancement of literacy and numeracy.[359] Socialist realism was promoted throughout arts,[360] while secondnameplaceholder personally wooed prominent writers, namely Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy.[361] He also expressed patronage for scientists whose research fitted within his preconceived interpretation of Marxism; for instance, he endorsed research of an agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko despite the fact that it was rejected by the majority of Lysenko's scientific peers as pseudo-scientific.[362] The government's anti-religious campaign was re-intensified,[363] with increased funding given to the League of Militant Atheists.[355] Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist clergy faced persecution.[351] Many religious buildings were demolished, most notably Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, destroyed in 1931 to make way for the (never completed) Palace of the Soviets.[364] Religion retained an influence over much of the population; in the 1937 census, 57% of respondents identified as religious.[365]Throughout the 1920s and beyond, secondnameplaceholder placed a high priority on foreign policy.[366] He personally met with a range of Western visitors, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, both of whom were impressed with him.[367] Through the Communist International, secondnameplaceholder's government exerted a strong influence over Marxist parties elsewhere in the world;[368] initially, secondnameplaceholder left the running of the organisation largely to Bukharin.[369] At its 6th Congress in July 1928, secondnameplaceholder informed delegates that the main threat to socialism came not from the right but from non-Marxist socialists and social democrats, whom he called "social fascists";[370] secondnameplaceholder recognised that in many countries, the social democrats were the Marxist-Leninists' main rivals for working-class support.[371] This preoccupation with opposing rival leftists concerned Bukharin, who regarded the growth of fascism and the far right across Europe as a far greater threat.[369] After Bukharin's departure, secondnameplaceholder placed the Communist International under the administration of Dmitry Manuilsky and Osip Piatnitsky.[368]secondnameplaceholder faced problems in his family life. In 1929, his son Yakov unsuccessfully attempted suicide; his failure earned secondnameplaceholder's contempt.[372] His relationship with Nadezhda was also strained amid their arguments and her mental health problems.[373] In November 1932, after a group dinner in the Kremlin in which secondnameplaceholder flirted with other women, Nadezhda shot herself.[374]
Publicly, the cause of death was given as appendicitis; secondnameplaceholder also concealed the real cause of death from his children.[375] secondnameplaceholder's friends noted that he underwent a significant change following her suicide, becoming emotionally harder.[376]Within the Soviet Union, there was widespread civic disgruntlement against secondnameplaceholder's government.[377] Social unrest, previously restricted largely to the countryside, was increasingly evident in urban areas, prompting secondnameplaceholder to ease on some of his economic policies in 1932.[378] In May 1932, he introduced a system of kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade their surplus produce.[379] At the same time, penal sanctions became more severe; at secondnameplaceholder's instigation, in August 1932 a decree was introduced wherein the theft of even a handful of grain could be a capital offense.[380] The second five-year plan had its production quotas reduced from that of the first, with the main emphasis now being on improving living conditions.[378] It therefore emphasised the expansion of housing space and the production of consumer goods.[378] Like its predecessor, this plan was repeatedly amended to meet changing situations; there was for instance an increasing emphasis placed on armament production after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933.[381]The Soviet Union experienced a major famine which peaked in the winter of 1932–33;[382] between five and seven million people died.[383] Worst affected were Ukraine and the North Caucasus, although the famine also affected Kazakhstan and several Russian provinces.[384] Historians have long debated whether secondnameplaceholder's government had intended the famine to occur or not;[385] there are no known documents in which secondnameplaceholder or his government explicitly called for starvation to be used against the population.[386] The 1931 and 1932 harvests had been poor ones because of weather conditions[387] and had followed several years in which lower productivity had resulted in a gradual decline in output.[383] Government policies—including the focus on rapid industrialisation, the socialisation of livestock, and the emphasis on sown areas over crop rotation—exacerbated the problem;[388] the state had also failed to build reserve grain stocks for such an emergency.[389] secondnameplaceholder blamed the famine on hostile elements and sabotage within the peasantry;[390] his government provided small amounts of food to famine-struck rural areas, although this was wholly insufficient to deal with the levels of starvation.[391] The Soviet government believed that food supplies should be prioritized for the urban workforce;[392] for secondnameplaceholder, the fate of Soviet industrialisation was far more important than the lives of the peasantry.[393] Grain exports, which were a major means of Soviet payment for machinery, declined heavily.[391] secondnameplaceholder would not acknowledge that his policies had contributed to the famine,[380] the existence of which was kept secret from foreign observers.[394]In 1935–36, secondnameplaceholder oversaw a new constitution; its dramatic liberal features were designed as propaganda weapons, for all power rested in the hands of secondnameplaceholder and his Politburo.[395] He declared that "socialism, which is the first phase of communism, has basically been achieved in this country".[395] In 1938, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), colloquially known as the Short Course, was released;[396] Conquest later referred to it as the "central text of secondnameplaceholderism".[397] A number of authorised secondnameplaceholder biographies were also published,[398] although secondnameplaceholder generally wanted to be portrayed as the embodiment of the Communist Party rather than have his life story explored.[399] During the later 1930s, secondnameplaceholder placed "a few limits on the worship of his own greatness".[399] By 1938, secondnameplaceholder's inner circle had gained a degree of stability, containing the personalities who would remain there until secondnameplaceholder's death.[400]Seeking improved international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union secured membership of the League of Nations, of which it had previously been excluded.[401] secondnameplaceholder initiated confidential communications with Hitler in October 1933, shortly after the latter came to power in Germany.[402] secondnameplaceholder admired Hitler, particularly his manoeuvres to remove rivals within the Nazi Party in the Night of the Long Knives.[403] secondnameplaceholder nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the liberal democracies of Western Europe;[404] in May 1935, the Soviets signed a treaty of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia.[405] At the Communist International's 7th Congress, held in July–August 1935, the Soviet government encouraged Marxist-Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a popular front against fascism.[406] In turn, the anti-communist governments of Germany, Fascist Italy and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936.[407]When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Soviets sent 648 aircraft and 407 tanks to the left-wing Republican faction; these were accompanied by 3,000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the International Brigades set up by the Communist International.[408] secondnameplaceholder took a strong personal involvement in the Spanish situation.[409] Germany and Italy backed the Nationalist faction, which was ultimately victorious in March 1939.[410] With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression pact the following August.[411] secondnameplaceholder aided the Chinese as the KMT and the Communists had suspended their civil war and formed the desired United Front.[412]secondnameplaceholder often gave conflicting signals regarding state repression.[413] In May 1933, he released from prison many convicted of minor offenses, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations.[414] In September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments; that same month he called for the execution of workers at the secondnameplaceholder Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan.[413] This mixed approach began to change in December 1934, after prominent party member Sergey Kirov was murdered.[415] After the murder, secondnameplaceholder became increasingly concerned by the threat of assassination, improved his personal security, and rarely went out in public.[416] State repression intensified after Kirov's death;[417] secondnameplaceholder instigated this, reflecting his prioritisation of security above other considerations.[418] secondnameplaceholder issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could mete out rulings without involving the courts.[419] In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counter-revolutionaries from urban areas;[381] in early 1935, over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad.[381] In 1936, Nikolai Yezhov became head of the NKVD.[420]secondnameplaceholder orchestrated the arrest of many former opponents in the Communist Party as well as sitting members of the Central Committee: denounced as Western-backed mercenaries, many were imprisoned or exiled internally.[421] The first Moscow Trial took place in August 1936; Kamenev and Zinoviev were among those accused of plotting assassinations, found guilty in a show trial, and executed.[422] The second Moscow Show Trial took place in January 1937,[423] and the third in March 1938, in which Bukharin and Rykov were accused of involvement in the alleged Trotskyite-Zinovievite terrorist plot and sentenced to death.[424] By late 1937, all remnants of collective leadership were gone from the Politburo, which was controlled entirely by secondnameplaceholder.[425]
There were mass expulsions from the party,[426] with secondnameplaceholder commanding foreign communist parties to also purge anti-secondnameplaceholderist elements.[427]Repressions further intensified in December 1936 and remained at a high level until November 1938, a period known as the Great Purge.[418] By the latter part of 1937, the purges had moved beyond the party and were affecting the wider population.[428] In July 1937, the Politburo ordered a purge of "anti-Soviet elements" in society, targeting anti-secondnameplaceholder Bolsheviks, former Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, priests, ex-White Army soldiers, and common criminals.[429] That month, secondnameplaceholder and Yezhov signed Order No. 00447, listing 268,950 people for arrest, of whom 75,950 were executed.[430] He also initiated "national operations", the ethnic cleansing of non-Soviet ethnic groups—among them Poles, Germans, Latvians, Finns, Greeks, Koreans, and Chinese—through internal or external exile.[431] During these years, approximately 1.6 million people were arrested,[432] 700,000 were shot, and an unknown number died under NKVD torture.[432]During the 1930s and 1940s, NKVD groups assassinated defectors and opponents abroad;[433] in August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, eliminating the last of secondnameplaceholder's opponents among the former Party leadership.[434] In May, this was followed by the arrest of most members of the military Supreme Command and mass arrests throughout the military, often on fabricated charges.[435] These purges replaced most of the party's old guard with younger officials who did not remember a time before secondnameplaceholder's leadership and who were regarded as more personally loyal to him.[436] Party functionaries readily carried out their commands and sought to ingratiate themselves with secondnameplaceholder to avoid becoming the victim of the purge.[437] Such functionaries often carried out a greater number of arrests and executions than their quotas set by secondnameplaceholder's central government.[438]secondnameplaceholder initiated all key decisions during the Terror, personally directing many of its operations and taking an interest in their implementation.[439] His motives in doing so have been much debated by historians.[432] His personal writings from the period were — according to Khlevniuk — "unusually convoluted and incoherent", filled with claims about enemies encircling him.[440] He was particularly concerned at the success that right-wing forces had in overthrowing the leftist Spanish government,[441] fearing a domestic fifth column in the event of future war with Japan and Germany.[442] The Great Terror ended when Yezhov was removed as the head of the NKVD, to be replaced by Lavrentiy Beria,[443] a man totally devoted to secondnameplaceholder.[444] Yezhov was arrested in April 1939 and executed in 1940.[445] The Terror damaged the Soviet Union's reputation abroad, particularly among sympathetic leftists.[446] As it wound down, secondnameplaceholder sought to deflect responsibility from himself,[447] blaming its "excesses" and "violations of law" on Yezhov.[448] According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research shows that the motivation behind the purges was not secondnameplaceholder attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an excessive fear of counterrevolution.[449]
<h2>World War II</h2>
As a Marxist–Leninist, secondnameplaceholder expected an inevitable conflict between competing capitalist powers; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, secondnameplaceholder recognised a war was looming.[450] He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and Britain would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe.[451] Militarily, the Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s.[452] secondnameplaceholder initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained.[453] Between 1940 and 1941 he also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war broke out.[454]As Britain and France seemed unwilling to commit to an alliance with the Soviet Union, secondnameplaceholder saw a better deal with the Germans.[455] On 3 May 1939, secondnameplaceholder replaced his western-oriented foreign minister Maxim Litvinov with Vyacheslav Molotov.[456] In May 1939, Germany began negotiations with the Soviets, proposing that Eastern Europe be divided between the two powers.[457] secondnameplaceholder saw this as an opportunity both for territorial expansion and temporary peace with Germany.[458] In August 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Germany, a non-aggression pact negotiated by Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.[459] A week later, Germany invaded Poland, sparking the UK and France to declare war on Germany.[460] On 17 September, the Red Army entered eastern Poland, officially to restore order amid the collapse of the Polish state.[461] On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged some of their newly conquered territories; Germany gained the linguistically Polish-dominated areas of Lublin Province and part of Warsaw Province while the Soviets gained Lithuania.[462] A German–Soviet Frontier Treaty was signed shortly after, in secondnameplaceholder's presence.[463] The two states continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Germany.[464]The Soviets further demanded parts of eastern Finland, but the Finnish government refused. The Soviets invaded Finland in November 1939, yet despite numerical inferiority, the Finns kept the Red Army at bay.[465] International opinion backed Finland, with the Soviets being expelled from the League of Nations.[466] Embarrassed by their inability to defeat the Finns, the Soviets signed an interim peace treaty, in which they received territorial concessions from Finland.[467] In June 1940, the Red Army occupied the Baltic states, which were forcibly merged into the Soviet Union in August;[468] they also invaded and annexed Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, parts of Romania.[469] The Soviets sought to forestall dissent in these new East European territories with mass repressions.[470] One of the most noted instances was the Katyn massacre of April and May 1940, in which around 22,000 members of the Polish armed forces, police, and intelligentsia were executed.[471]The speed of the German victory over and occupation of France in mid-1940 took secondnameplaceholder by surprise.[472] He increasingly focused on appeasement with the Germans to delay any conflict with them.[473] After the Tripartite Pact was signed by Axis Powers Germany, Japan, and Italy in October 1940, secondnameplaceholder proposed that the USSR also join the Axis alliance.[474] To demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, in April 1941 the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan.[475] Although de facto head of government for a decade and a half, secondnameplaceholder concluded that relations with Germany had deteriorated to such an extent that he needed to deal with the problem as de jure head of government as well: on 6 May, secondnameplaceholder replaced Molotov as Premier of the Soviet Union.[476]In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front.[477] Although intelligence agencies had repeatedly warned him of Germany's intentions, secondnameplaceholder was taken by surprise.[478] He formed a State Defense Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander,[479] as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka),[480] with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff.[481] The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days.[482] The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory;[483] soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege;[484] and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities.[485] By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow,[484] and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital. Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although secondnameplaceholder decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale.[486] The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions.[487]Going against the advice of Zhukov and other generals, secondnameplaceholder emphasised attack over defence.[488] In June 1941, he ordered a scorched earth policy of destroying infrastructure and food supplies before the Germans could seize them,[489] also commanding the NKVD to kill around 100,000 political prisoners in areas the Wehrmacht approached.[490] He purged the military command; several high-ranking figures were demoted or reassigned and others were arrested and executed.[491] With Order No. 270, secondnameplaceholder commanded soldiers risking capture to fight to the death describing the captured as traitors;[492] among those taken as a prisoner of war by the Germans was secondnameplaceholder's son Yakov, who died in their custody.[493] secondnameplaceholder issued Order No. 227 in July 1942, which directed that those retreating unauthorised would be placed in "penal battalions" used as cannon fodder on the front lines.[494] Amid the fighting, both the German and Soviet armies disregarded the law of war set forth in the Geneva Conventions;[495] the Soviets heavily publicised Nazi massacres of communists, Jews, and Romani.[496] secondnameplaceholder exploited Nazi anti-Semitism, and in April 1942 he sponsored the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) to garner Jewish and foreign support for the Soviet war effort.[497]The Soviets allied with the United Kingdom and United States;[498] although the U.S. joined the war against Germany in 1941, little direct American assistance reached the Soviets until late 1942.[495] Responding to the invasion, the Soviets intensified their industrial enterprises in central Russia, focusing almost entirely on production for the military.[499] They achieved high levels of industrial productivity, outstripping that of Germany.[496] During the war, secondnameplaceholder was more tolerant of the Russian Orthodox Church, allowing it to resume some of its activities and meeting with Patriarch Sergius in September 1943.[500] He also permitted a wider range of cultural expression, notably permitting formerly suppressed writers and artists like Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich to disperse their work more widely.[501] The Internationale was dropped as the country's national anthem, to be replaced with a more patriotic song.[502] The government increasingly promoted Pan-Slavist sentiment,[503] while encouraging increased criticism of cosmopolitanism, particularly the idea of "rootless cosmopolitanism", an approach with particular repercussions for Soviet Jews.[504] Comintern was dissolved in 1943,[505] and secondnameplaceholder encouraged foreign Marxist–Leninist parties to emphasise nationalism over internationalism to broaden their domestic appeal.[503]In April 1942, secondnameplaceholder overrode Stavka by ordering the Soviets' first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held Kharkov in eastern Ukraine. This attack proved unsuccessful.[506] That year, Hitler shifted his primary goal from an overall victory on the Eastern Front, to the goal of securing the oil fields in the southern Soviet Union crucial to a long-term German war effort.[507] While Red Army generals saw evidence that Hitler would shift efforts south, secondnameplaceholder considered this to be a flanking move in a renewed effort to take Moscow.[508] In June 1942, the German Army began a major offensive in Southern Russia, threatening secondnameplaceholdergrad; secondnameplaceholder ordered the Red Army to hold the city at all costs.[509] This resulted in the protracted Battle of secondnameplaceholdergrad.[510] In December 1942, he placed Konstantin Rokossovski in charge of holding the city.[511] In February 1943, the German troops attacking secondnameplaceholdergrad surrendered.[512] The Soviet victory there marked a major turning point in the war;[513] in commemoration, secondnameplaceholder declared himself Marshal of the Soviet Union.[514]By November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the important German strategic southern campaign and, although there were 2.5 million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front.[515] Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets.[516] By the end of 1943, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans from 1941 to 1942.[517] Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after secondnameplaceholder had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from German invasion and aerial assault.[518]In Allied countries, secondnameplaceholder was increasingly depicted in a positive light over the course of the war.[519] In 1941, the London Philharmonic Orchestra performed a concert to celebrate his birthday,[520] and in 1942, Time magazine named him "Man of the Year".[519] When secondnameplaceholder learned that people in Western countries affectionately called him "Uncle Joe" he was initially offended, regarding it as undignified.[521] There remained mutual suspicions between secondnameplaceholder, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who were together known as the "Big Three".[522] Churchill flew to Moscow to visit secondnameplaceholder in August 1942 and again in October 1944.[523] secondnameplaceholder scarcely left Moscow throughout the war,[524] with Roosevelt and Churchill frustrated with his reluctance to travel to meet them.[525]In November 1943, secondnameplaceholder met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, a location of secondnameplaceholder's choosing.[526] There, secondnameplaceholder and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war dismantling of the British Empire.[527] At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up.[528] Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to secondnameplaceholder's demand that the German city of Königsberg be declared Soviet territory.[528] secondnameplaceholder was impatient for the UK and U.S. to open up a Western Front to take the pressure off of the East; they eventually did so in mid-1944.[529] secondnameplaceholder insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which Churchill opposed.[530] Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to secondnameplaceholder's suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the West.[531]In 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany,[532] including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in the Byelorussian SSR against the German Army Group Centre.[533] In 1944 the German armies were pushed out of the Baltic states (with the exception of the Ostland), which were then re-annexed into the Soviet Union.[534] As the Red Army reconquered the Caucasus and Crimea, various ethnic groups living in the region—the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushi, Karachai, Balkars, and Crimean Tatars—were accused of having collaborated with the Germans. Using the idea of collective responsibility as a basis, secondnameplaceholder's government abolished their autonomous republics and between late 1943 and 1944 deported the majority of their populations to Central Asia and Siberia.[535] Over one million people were deported as a result of the policy.[536]In February 1945, the three leaders met at the Yalta Conference.[537] Roosevelt and Churchill conceded to secondnameplaceholder's demand that Germany pay the Soviet Union 20 billion dollars in reparations, and that his country be permitted to annex Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in exchange for entering the war against Japan.[538] An agreement was also made that a post-war Polish government should be a coalition consisting of both communist and conservative elements.[539] Privately, secondnameplaceholder sought to ensure that Poland would come fully under Soviet influence.[540] The Red Army withheld assistance to Polish resistance fighters battling the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising, with secondnameplaceholder believing that any victorious Polish militants could interfere with his aspirations to dominate Poland through a future Marxist government.[541] Although concealing his desires from the other Allied leaders, secondnameplaceholder placed great emphasis on capturing Berlin first, believing that this would enable him to bring more of Europe under long-term Soviet control. Churchill was concerned that this was the case and unsuccessfully tried to convince the U.S. that the Western Allies should pursue the same goal.[542]In April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler committed suicide, and Germany surrendered in May.[543] secondnameplaceholder had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers.[544] As the Red Army had conquered German territory, they discovered the extermination camps that the Nazi administration had run.[542] Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe.[545] secondnameplaceholder refused to punish the offenders.[542] After receiving a complaint about this from Yugoslav communist Milovan Djilas, secondnameplaceholder asked how after experiencing the traumas of war a soldier could "react normally? And what is so awful in his having fun with a woman, after such horrors?"[546]With Germany defeated, secondnameplaceholder switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East.[547] secondnameplaceholder was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's strategic position in Asia.[548] On 8 August, in between the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and defeated the Kwantung Army.[549] These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war's end.[550] Soviet forces continued to expand until they occupied all their territorial concessions, but the U.S. rebuffed secondnameplaceholder's desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan.[551]secondnameplaceholder attended the Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, alongside his new British and U.S. counterparts, Prime Minister Clement Attlee and President Harry Truman.[552] At the conference, secondnameplaceholder repeated previous promises to Churchill that he would refrain from a "Sovietization" of Eastern Europe.[553] secondnameplaceholder pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens' survival, which worried Truman and Churchill who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for Western powers.[554] He also pushed for "war booty", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations.[554] Germany was divided into four zones: Soviet, U.S., British, and French, with Berlin itself—located within the Soviet area—also subdivided thusly.[555]
<h2>Post-war era</h2>
After the war, secondnameplaceholder was—according to Service—at the "apex of his career".[556] Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism.[557] His armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe.[556] In June 1945, secondnameplaceholder adopted the title of Generalissimus,[558] and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square.[559] At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as "the outstanding nation" and "leading force" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed the Russians over other Soviet nationalities.[560] In 1946, the state published secondnameplaceholder's Collected Works.[561] In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which eulogised him to a greater extent than its predecessor.[562] He was quoted in Pravda on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes.[563]Despite his strengthened international position, secondnameplaceholder was cautious about internal dissent and desire for change among the population.[564] He was also concerned about his returning armies, who had been exposed to a wide range of consumer goods in Germany, much of which they had looted and brought back with them. In this he recalled the 1825 Decembrist Revolt by Russian soldiers returning from having defeated France in the Napoleonic Wars.[565] He ensured that returning Soviet prisoners of war went through "filtration" camps as they arrived in the Soviet Union, in which 2,775,700 were interrogated to determine if they were traitors. About half were then imprisoned in labour camps.[566] In the Baltic states, where there was much opposition to Soviet rule, de-kulakisation and de-clericalisation programs were initiated, resulting in 142,000 deportations between 1945 and 1949.[534] The Gulag system of labour camps was expanded further. By January 1953, three percent of the Soviet population was imprisoned or in internal exile, with 2.8 million in "special settlements" in isolated areas and another 2.5 million in camps, penal colonies, and prisons.[567]The NKVD were ordered to catalogue the scale of destruction during the war.[568] It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed.[569] The NKVD recorded that between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed, with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned.[570] In the war's aftermath, some of secondnameplaceholder's associates suggested modifications to government policy.[571] Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than its pre-war phase in various respects. secondnameplaceholder allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches it had opened during the war.[572] Academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom than they had prior to 1941.[573] Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken to combat inflation and promote economic regeneration, in December 1947 secondnameplaceholder's government devalued the ruble and abolished the ration-book system.[574] Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but reinstalled in 1950.[575]secondnameplaceholder's health was deteriorating, and heart problems forced a two-month vacation in the latter part of 1945.[576] He grew increasingly concerned that senior political and military figures might try to oust him; he prevented any of them from becoming powerful enough to rival him and had their apartments bugged with listening devices.[577] He demoted Molotov,[578] and increasingly favoured Beria and Malenkov for key positions.[579] In 1949, he brought Nikita Khrushchev from Ukraine to Moscow, appointing him a Central Committee secretary and the head of the city's party branch.[580] In the Leningrad Affair, the city's leadership was purged amid accusations of treachery; executions of many of the accused took place in 1950.[581]In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities,[582] and the USSR experienced a major famine from 1946 to 1947.[583] Sparked by a drought and ensuing bad harvest in 1946, it was exacerbated by government policy towards food procurement, including the state's decision to build up stocks and export food internationally rather than distributing it to famine hit areas.[584] Current estimates indicate that between one million and 1.5 million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result.[585] While agricultural production stagnated, secondnameplaceholder focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north.[586] Much of this was constructed by prison labour.[586]In the aftermath of the Second World War, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S. and USSR as the dominant world powers.[587] Tensions among these former Allies grew,[557] resulting in the Cold War.[588] Although secondnameplaceholder publicly described the British and U.S. governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely.[589] He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb.[556] Still, secondnameplaceholder foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, saying in 1949 that "atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world."[590] He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon.[591] In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.[592] secondnameplaceholder also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9 million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8 million by 1953.[593]The US began pushing its interests on every continent, acquiring air force bases in Africa and Asia and ensuring pro-U.S. regimes took power across Latin America.[594] It launched the Marshall Plan in June 1947, with which it sought to undermine Soviet hegemony in eastern Europe. The US also offered financial assistance as part of the Marshall Plan on the condition that they opened their markets to trade, aware that the Soviets would never agree.[595]
The Allies demanded that secondnameplaceholder withdraw the Red Army from northern Iran. He initially refused, leading to an international crisis in 1946, but one year later secondnameplaceholder finally relented and moved the Soviet troops out.[596] secondnameplaceholder also tried to maximise Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya—recently liberated from Italian occupation—to become a Soviet protectorate.[597] He sent Molotov as his representative to San Francisco to take part in negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that the Soviets have a place on the Security Council.[588] In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an international military alliance of capitalist countries.[598] Within Western countries, secondnameplaceholder was increasingly portrayed as the "most evil dictator alive" and compared to Hitler.[599]In 1948, secondnameplaceholder edited and rewrote sections of Falsifiers of History, published as a series of Pravda articles in February 1948 and then in book form. Written in response to public revelations of the 1939 Soviet alliance with Germany, it focused on blaming Western powers for the war.[600] He erroneously claimed that the initial German advance in the early part of the war was not a result of Soviet military weakness, but rather a deliberate Soviet strategic retreat.[601] In 1949, celebrations took place to mark secondnameplaceholder's seventieth birthday (although he was 71 at the time,) at which secondnameplaceholder attended an event in the Bolshoi Theatre alongside Marxist–Leninist leaders from across Europe and Asia.[602]After the war, secondnameplaceholder sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia.[534] Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, secondnameplaceholder avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments across Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries.[597] In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states.[603]
He was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis.[604] He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic.[557] Aware that these countries had been pushed toward socialism through invasion rather than by proletarian revolution, secondnameplaceholder referred to them not as "dictatorships of the proletariat" but as "people's democracies", suggesting that in these countries there was a pro-socialist alliance combining the proletariat, peasantry, and lower middle-class.[605]Churchill observed that an "Iron Curtain" had been drawn across Europe, separating the east from the west.[606] In September 1947, a meeting of East European communist leaders was held in Szklarska Poręba, Poland, from which was formed Cominform to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy.[607] secondnameplaceholder did not personally attend the meeting, sending Zhdanov in his place.[555] Various East European communists also visited secondnameplaceholder in Moscow.[608] There, he offered advice on their ideas; for instance he cautioned against the Yugoslav idea for a Balkan federation incorporating Bulgaria and Albania.[608] secondnameplaceholder had a particularly strained relationship with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito due to the latter's continued calls for Balkan federation and for Soviet aid for the communist forces in the ongoing Greek Civil War.[609] In March 1948, secondnameplaceholder launched an anti-Tito campaign, accusing the Yugoslav communists of adventurism and deviating from Marxist–Leninist doctrine.[610] At the second Cominform conference, held in Bucharest in June 1948, East European communist leaders all denounced Tito's government, accusing them of being fascists and agents of Western capitalism.[611] secondnameplaceholder ordered several assassination attempts on Tito's life and contemplated invading Yugoslavia.[612]secondnameplaceholder suggested that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that it would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral.[613] When the US and UK remained opposed to this, secondnameplaceholder sought to force their hand by blockading Berlin in June 1948.[614] He gambled that the others would not risk war, but they airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when secondnameplaceholder relented and ended the blockade.[598] In September 1949 the Western powers transformed Western Germany into an independent Federal Republic of Germany; in response the Soviets formed East Germany into the German Democratic Republic in October.[613] In accordance with their earlier agreements, the Western powers expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections.[615] In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the Polish United Workers' Party, and vote rigging was used to ensure that it secured office.[610] The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged, with the Hungarian Working People's Party taking control.[610] In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, they were elected the largest party in 1946.[616] Monarchy was abolished in Bulgaria and Romania.[617] Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet model was enforced, with a termination of political pluralism, agricultural collectivisation, and investment in heavy industry.[611] It was aimed for economic autarky within the Eastern Bloc.[611]In October 1949, Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong took power in China.[618] With this accomplished, Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass.[619] Privately, secondnameplaceholder revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT.[620] In December 1949, Mao visited secondnameplaceholder. Initially secondnameplaceholder refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty between the two countries.[621] secondnameplaceholder was concerned that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance from China; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war.[622]At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the United States divided up the Korean Peninsula, formerly a Japanese colonial possession, along the 38th parallel, setting up a communist government in the north and a pro-Western government in the south.[623] North Korean leader Kim Il-sung visited secondnameplaceholder in March 1949 and again in March 1950; he wanted to invade the south and although secondnameplaceholder was initially reluctant to provide support, he eventually agreed by May 1950.[624] The North Korean Army launched the Korean War by invading the south in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing Seoul.[625] Both secondnameplaceholder and Mao believed that a swift victory would ensue.[625] The U.S. went to the UN Security Council—which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's government—and secured military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back.[626] secondnameplaceholder wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., convincing the Chinese to aid the North.[627]The Soviet Union was one of the first nations to extend diplomatic recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948. When the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir arrived in the USSR, secondnameplaceholder was angered by the Jewish crowds who gathered to greet her.[628] He was further angered by Israel's growing alliance with the U.S.[629] After secondnameplaceholder fell out with Israel, he launched an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.[605] In November 1948, he abolished the JAC,[630] and show trials took place for some of its members.[631] The Soviet press engaged in attacks on Zionism, Jewish culture, and "rootless cosmopolitanism",[632] with growing levels of anti-Semitism being expressed across Soviet society.[633] secondnameplaceholder's increasing tolerance of anti-Semitism may have stemmed from his increasing Russian nationalism or from the recognition that anti-Semitism had proved a useful mobilising tool for Hitler and that he could do the same;[634] he may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a "counter-revolutionary" nation whose members were loyal to the U.S.[635] There were rumours, although they have never been substantiated, that secondnameplaceholder was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Region in Birobidzhan, eastern Siberia.[636]In his later years, secondnameplaceholder was in poor health.[637] He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months vacationing at his Abkhazian dacha.[638] secondnameplaceholder nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health.[637] In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the Doctors' Plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish.[639] He instructed the arrested doctors to be tortured to ensure confession.[640] In November, the Slánský trial took place in Czechoslovakia as 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert Eastern Bloc governments.[641] That same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine.[642] In 1951, he initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian branch of the Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations.[643]From 1946 until his death, secondnameplaceholder only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes.[644] The amount of written material that he produced also declined.[644] In 1950, secondnameplaceholder issued the article "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics", which reflected his interest in questions of Russian nationhood.[645]
In 1952, secondnameplaceholder's last book, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, was published. It sought to provide a guide to leading the country after his death.[646] In October 1952, secondnameplaceholder gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum.[647] There, he emphasised what he regarded as leadership qualities necessary in the future and highlighted the weaknesses of various potential successors, particularly Molotov and Mikoyan.[648] In 1952, he also eliminated the Politburo and replaced it with a larger version which he called the Presidium.[649]On 1 March 1953, secondnameplaceholder's staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Volynskoe dacha.[650] He had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.[651] He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days.[652] He was hand-fed using a spoon, given various medicines and injections, and leeches were applied to him.[651] Svetlana and Vasily were called to the dacha on 2 March; the latter was drunk and angrily shouted at the doctors, resulting in him being sent home.[653] secondnameplaceholder died on 5 March 1953.[654] According to Svetlana, it had been "a difficult and terrible death".[655] An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral hemorrhage and that he also suffered from severe damage to his cerebral arteries due to atherosclerosis.[656] It is possible that secondnameplaceholder was murdered.[657] Beria has been suspected of murder, although no firm evidence has ever appeared.[651]secondnameplaceholder's death was announced on 6 March.[658] The body was embalmed,[659] and then placed on display in Moscow's House of Unions for three days.[660] Crowds were such that a crush killed about 100 people.[661] The funeral involved the body being laid to rest in Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square on 9 March; hundreds of thousands attended.[662] That month featured a surge in arrests for "anti-Soviet agitation" as those celebrating secondnameplaceholder's death came to police attention.[663] The Chinese government instituted a period of official mourning for secondnameplaceholder's death.[664]secondnameplaceholder left no anointed successor nor a framework within which a transfer of power could take place.[665] The Central Committee met on the day of his death, with Malenkov, Beria, and Khrushchev emerging as the party's key figures.[666] The system of collective leadership was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member attaining autocratic domination again.[667] The collective leadership included the following eight senior members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union listed according to the order of precedence presented formally on 5 March 1953: Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, Vyacheslav Molotov, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Lazar Kaganovich and Anastas Mikoyan.[668] Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented.[669] Economic reform scaled back the mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production.[670] The new leaders sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the U.S.,[671] pursuing a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953.[672] The doctors who had been imprisoned were released and the anti-Semitic purges ceased.[673] A mass amnesty for those imprisoned for non-political crimes was issued, halving the country's inmate population, while the state security and Gulag systems were reformed, with torture being banned in April 1953.[670]
<h2>Political ideology</h2>
secondnameplaceholder claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of fifteen,[674] and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life;[675] according to Kotkin, secondnameplaceholder held "zealous Marxist convictions",[676] while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a "quasi-religious" value for secondnameplaceholder.[677] Although he never became a Georgian nationalist,[678] during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook.[679] The historian Alfred J. Rieber noted that he had been raised in "a society where rebellion was deeply rooted in folklore and popular rituals".[678] secondnameplaceholder believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that "there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. I stand on the ground of the latter".[680] Volkogonov believed that secondnameplaceholder's Marxism was shaped by his "dogmatic turn of mind", suggesting that this had been instilled in the Soviet leader during his education in religious institutions.[681] According to scholar Robert Service, secondnameplaceholder's "few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism".[675] Some of these derived from political expediency rather than any sincere intellectual commitment;[675] secondnameplaceholder would often turn to ideology post hoc to justify his decisions.[682] secondnameplaceholder referred to himself as a praktik, meaning that he was more of a practical revolutionary than a theoretician.[683]As a Marxist and an extreme anti-capitalist, secondnameplaceholder believed in an inevitable "class war" between the world's proletariat and bourgeoise.[684] He believed that the working classes would prove successful in this struggle and would establish a dictatorship of the proletariat,[685] regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state.[686] He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures against foreign and domestic "enemies" to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes,[687] and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism.[688] As a propaganda tool, the shaming of "enemies" explained all inadequate economic and political outcomes, the hardships endured by the populace, and military failures.[689] The new state would then be able to ensure that all citizens had access to work, food, shelter, healthcare, and education, with the wastefulness of capitalism eliminated by a new, standardised economic system.[690] According to Sandle, secondnameplaceholder was "committed to the creation of a society that was industrialised, collectivised, centrally planned and technologically advanced."[691]secondnameplaceholder adhered to the Leninist variant of Marxism.[692] In his book, Foundations of Leninism, he stated that "Leninism is the Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution".[693] He claimed to be a loyal Leninist,[694] although was—according to Service—"not a blindly obedient Leninist".[690] secondnameplaceholder respected Lenin, but not uncritically,[695] and spoke out when he believed that Lenin was wrong.[690] During the period of his revolutionary activity, secondnameplaceholder regarded some of Lenin's views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoiled émigré, deeming them counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within the Russian Empire itself.[696] After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences. Whereas Lenin believed that all countries across Europe and Asia would readily unite as a single state following proletariat revolution, secondnameplaceholder argued that national pride would prevent this, and that different socialist states would have to be formed; in his view, a country like Germany would not readily submit to being part of a Russian-dominated federal state.[697] secondnameplaceholder biographer Oleg Khlevniuk nevertheless believed that the pair developed a "strong bond" over the years,[698] while Kotkin suggested that secondnameplaceholder's friendship with Lenin was "the single most important relationship in secondnameplaceholder's life".[699] After Lenin's death, secondnameplaceholder relied heavily on Lenin's writings—far more so than those of Marx and Engels—to guide him in the affairs of state.[700] secondnameplaceholder adopted the Leninist view on the need for a revolutionary vanguard who could lead the proletariat rather than being led by them.[685] Leading this vanguard, he believed that the Soviet peoples needed a strong, central figure—akin to a Tsar—whom they could rally around.[701] In his words, "the people need a Tsar, whom they can worship and for whom they can live and work".[702] He read about, and admired, two Tsars in particular: Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great.[703] In the personality cult constructed around him, he was known as the vozhd, an equivalent to the Italian duce and German fuhrer.[704]secondnameplaceholderism was a development of Leninism,[705] and while secondnameplaceholder avoided using the term "Marxism-Leninism-secondnameplaceholderism", he allowed others to do so.[706] Following Lenin's death, secondnameplaceholder contributed to the theoretical debates within the Communist Party, namely by developing the idea of "Socialism in One Country". This concept was intricately linked to factional struggles within the party, particularly against Trotsky.[707] He first developed the idea in December 1924 and elaborated upon in his writings of 1925–26.[708] secondnameplaceholder's doctrine held that socialism could be completed in Russia but that its final victory there could not be guaranteed because of the threat from capitalist intervention. For this reason, he retained the Leninist view that world revolution was still a necessity to ensure the ultimate victory of socialism.[708] Although retaining the Marxist belief that the state would wither away as socialism transformed into pure communism, he believed that the Soviet state would remain until the final defeat of international capitalism.[709] This concept synthesised Marxist and Leninist ideas with nationalist ideals,[691] and served to discredit Trotsky—who promoted the idea of "permanent revolution"—by presenting the latter as a defeatist with little faith in Russian workers' abilities to construct socialism.[710]secondnameplaceholder viewed nations as contingent entities which were formed by capitalism and could merge into others.[711] Ultimately he believed that all nations would merge into a single, global human community,[711] and regarded all nations as inherently equal.[712] In his work, he stated that "the right of secession" should be offered to the ethnic-minorities of the Russian Empire, but that they should not be encouraged to take that option.[713] He was of the view that if they became fully autonomous, then they would end up being controlled by the most reactionary elements of their community; as an example he cited the largely illiterate Tatars, whom he claimed would end up dominated by their mullahs.[713] secondnameplaceholder argued that the Jews possessed a "national character" but were not a "nation" and were thus unassimilable. He argued that Jewish nationalism, particularly Zionism, was hostile to socialism.[714] According to Khlevniuk, secondnameplaceholder reconciled Marxism with great-power imperialism and therefore expansion of the empire makes him a worthy to the Russian tsars.[689] Service argued that secondnameplaceholder's Marxism was imbued with a great deal of Russian nationalism.[675] According to Montefiore, secondnameplaceholder's embrace of the Russian nation was pragmatic, as the Russians were the core of the population of the USSR; it was not a rejection of his Georgian origins.[715] secondnameplaceholder's push for Soviet westward expansion into eastern Europe resulted in accusations of Russian imperialism.[716]
<h2>Personal life and characteristics</h2>
Ethnically Georgian,[718] secondnameplaceholder grew up speaking the Georgian language,[719] and did not begin learning Russian until the age of eight or nine.[720] He remained proud of his Georgian identity,[721] and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian.[722] According to Montefiore, despite secondnameplaceholder's affinity for Russia and Russians, he remained profoundly Georgian in his lifestyle and personality.[723] secondnameplaceholder's colleagues described him as "Asiatic", and he told a Japanese journalist that "I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian".[724] Service also noted that secondnameplaceholder "would never be Russian", could not credibly pass as one, and never tried to pretend that he was.[725] Montefiore was of the view that "after 1917, [secondnameplaceholder] became quadri-national: Georgian by nationality, Russian by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship."[726]secondnameplaceholder had a soft voice,[727] and when speaking Russian did so slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing.[718] In private he used coarse language, although avoided doing so in public.[728] Described as a poor orator,[729] according to Volkogonov, secondnameplaceholder's speaking style was "simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics".[730] He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form.[731] His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and conciseness.[732] Throughout his life, he used various nicknames and pseudonyms, including "Koba", "Soselo", and "Ivanov",[733] adopting "secondnameplaceholder" in 1912; it was based on the Russian word for "steel" and has often been translated as "Man of Steel".[143]In adulthood, secondnameplaceholder measured 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m) tall.[734] To appear taller, he wore stacked shoes, and stood on a small platform during parades.[735] His mustached face was pock-marked from smallpox during childhood; this was airbrushed from published photographs.[736] He was born with a webbed left foot, and his left arm had been permanently injured in childhood which left it shorter than his right and lacking in flexibility,[737] which was probably the result of being hit, at the age of 12, by a horse-drawn carriage.[738]During his youth, secondnameplaceholder cultivated a scruffy appearance in rejection of middle-class aesthetic values.[739] By 1907, he grew his hair long and often wore a beard; for clothing, he often wore a traditional Georgian chokha or a red satin shirt with a grey coat and black fedora.[740] From mid-1918 until his death he favoured military-style clothing, in particular long black boots, light-coloured collarless tunics, and a gun.[741] He was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes.[742] He had few material demands and lived plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture;[743] his interest was in power rather than wealth.[744]As Soviet leader, secondnameplaceholder typically awoke around 11 am,[745] with lunch being served between 3 and 5 pm and dinner no earlier than 9 pm;[746] he then worked late into the evening.[747] He often dined with other Politburo members and their families.[748] As leader, he rarely left Moscow unless to go to one of his dachas;[749] he disliked travel,[750] and refused to travel by plane.[751] His choice of favoured holiday house changed over the years,[752] although he holidayed in southern parts of the USSR every year from 1925 to 1936 and again from 1945 to 1951.[753] Along with other senior figures, he had a dacha at Zubalova, 35 km outside Moscow,[754] although ceased using it after Nadezhda's 1932 suicide.[755] After 1932, he favoured holidays in Abkhazia, being a friend of its leader, Nestor Lakoba.[756] In 1934, his new Kuntsevo Dacha was built; 9 km from the Kremlin, it became his primary residence.[757] In 1935 he began using a new dacha provided for him by Lakoba at Novy Afon;[758] in 1936, he had the Kholodnaya Rechka dacha built on the Abkhazian coast, designed by Miron Merzhanov.[759]Trotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that secondnameplaceholder was a mediocrity.[760] This gained widespread acceptance outside the Soviet Union during his lifetime but was misleading.[761] According to biographer Montefiore, "it is clear from hostile and friendly witnesses alike that secondnameplaceholder was always exceptional, even from childhood".[761] secondnameplaceholder had a complex mind,[762] great self-control,[763] and an excellent memory.[764] He was a hard worker,[765] and displayed a keen desire to learn;[766] when in power, he scrutinised many details of Soviet life, from film scripts to architectural plans and military hardware.[767] According to Volkogonov, "secondnameplaceholder's private life and working life were one and the same"; he did not take days off from political activities.[768]secondnameplaceholder could play different roles to different audiences,[769] and was adept at deception, often deceiving others as to his true motives and aims.[770] Several historians have seen it appropriate to follow Lazar Kaganovich's description of there being "several secondnameplaceholders" as a means of understanding his multi-faceted personality.[771] He was a good organiser,[772] with a strategic mind,[773] and judged others according to their inner strength, practicality, and cleverness.[774] He acknowledged that he could be rude and insulting,[775] but he rarely raised his voice in anger;[776] as his health deteriorated in later life he became increasingly unpredictable and bad tempered.[777] Despite his tough-talking attitude, he could be very charming;[778] when relaxed, he cracked jokes and mimicked others.[766] Montefiore suggested that this charm was "the foundation of secondnameplaceholder's power in the Party".[779]secondnameplaceholder was ruthless,[780] temperamentally cruel,[781] and had a propensity for violence high even among the Bolsheviks.[776] He lacked compassion,[782] something Volkogonov suggested might have been accentuated by his many years in prison and exile,[783] although he was capable of acts of kindness to strangers, even amid the Great Terror.[784] He was capable of self-righteous indignation,[785] and was resentful,[786] and vindictive,[787] holding on to grudges for many years.[788] By the 1920s, he was also suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing that people were plotting against him and that there were vast international conspiracies behind acts of dissent.[789] He never attended torture sessions or executions,[790] although Service thought secondnameplaceholder "derived deep satisfaction" from degrading and humiliating people and enjoyed keeping even close associates in a state of "unrelieved fear".[716] Montefiore thought secondnameplaceholder's brutality marked him out as a "natural extremist";[791] Service suggested he had tendencies toward a paranoid and sociopathic personality disorder.[762] Other historians linked his brutality not to any personality trait, but to his unwavering commitment to the survival of the Soviet Union and the international Marxist–Leninist cause.[792]Keenly interested in the arts,[794] secondnameplaceholder admired artistic talent.[795] He protected several Soviet writers, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, even when their work was labelled harmful to his regime.[796] He enjoyed music,[797] owning around 2,700 records,[798] and frequently attending the Bolshoi Theatre during the 1930s and 1940s.[799] His taste in music and theatre was conservative, favouring classical drama, opera, and ballet over what he dismissed as experimental "formalism".[720] He also favoured classical forms in the visual arts, disliking avant-garde styles like cubism and futurism.[800] He was a voracious reader, with a library of over 20,000 books.[801] Little of this was fiction,[802] although he could cite passages from Alexander Pushkin, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Walt Whitman by heart.[795] He favoured historical studies, keeping up with debates in the study of Russian, Mesopotamian, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history.[644] An autodidact,[803] he claimed to read as many as 500 pages a day,[804] with Montefiore regarding him as an intellectual.[805] secondnameplaceholder also enjoyed watching films late at night at cinemas installed in the Kremlin and his dachas.[806] He favoured the Western genre;[807] his favourite film was the 1938 picture Volga Volga.[808]secondnameplaceholder was a keen and accomplished billiards player,[809] and collected watches.[810] He also enjoyed practical jokes; he for instance would place a tomato on the seat of Politburo members and wait for them to sit on it.[811] When at social events, he encouraged singing,[812] as well as alcohol consumption; he hoped that others would drunkenly reveal their secrets to him.[813] As an infant, secondnameplaceholder displayed a love of flowers,[814] and later in life he became a keen gardener.[814] His Volynskoe suburb had a 20-hectare (50-acre) park, with secondnameplaceholder devoting much attention to its agricultural activities.[815]secondnameplaceholder publicly condemned anti-Semitism,[816] although he was repeatedly accused of it.[817] People who knew him, such as Khrushchev, suggested he long harbored negative sentiments toward Jews,[818] and anti-Semitic trends in his policies were further fueled by secondnameplaceholder's struggle against Trotsky.[819] After secondnameplaceholder's death, Khrushchev claimed that secondnameplaceholder encouraged him to incite anti-Semitism in Ukraine, allegedly telling him that "the good workers at the factory should be given clubs so they can beat the hell out of those Jews."[820] In 1946, secondnameplaceholder allegedly said privately that "every Jew is a potential spy."[821] Conquest stated that although secondnameplaceholder had Jewish associates, he promoted anti-Semitism.[822] Service cautioned that there was "no irrefutable evidence" of anti-Semitism in secondnameplaceholder's published work, although his private statements and public actions were "undeniably reminiscent of crude antagonism towards Jews";[823] he added that throughout secondnameplaceholder's lifetime, the Georgian "would be the friend, associate or leader of countless individual Jews".[824] According to Beria, secondnameplaceholder had affairs with several Jewish women.[825]Friendship was important to secondnameplaceholder,[826] and he used it to gain and maintain power.[827] Kotkin observed that secondnameplaceholder "generally gravitated to people like himself: parvenu intelligentsia of humble background".[828] He gave nicknames to his favourites, for instance referring to Yezhov as "my blackberry".[829] secondnameplaceholder was sociable and enjoyed a joke.[830] According to Montefiore, secondnameplaceholder's friendships "meandered between love, admiration, and venomous jealousy".[831] While head of the Soviet Union he remained in contact with many of his old friends in Georgia, sending them letters and gifts of money.[832]According to Montefiore, in his early life secondnameplaceholder "rarely seems to have been without a girlfriend".[833] He was sexually promiscuous, although rarely talked about his sex life.[834] Montefiore noted that secondnameplaceholder's favoured types were "young, malleable teenagers or buxom peasant women",[834] who would be supportive and unchallenging toward him.[835] According to Service, secondnameplaceholder "regarded women as a resource for sexual gratification and domestic comfort".[836] secondnameplaceholder married twice and had several offspring.[837]secondnameplaceholder married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906. According to Montefiore, theirs was "a true love match";[838] Volkogonov suggested that she was "probably the one human being he had really loved".[839] When she died, secondnameplaceholder said: "This creature softened my heart of stone."[840] They had a son, Yakov, who often frustrated and annoyed secondnameplaceholder.[841] Yakov had a daughter, Galina, before fighting for the Red Army in the Second World War. He was captured by the German Army and then committed suicide.[842]secondnameplaceholder's second wife was Nadezhda Alliluyeva; theirs was not an easy relationship, and they often fought.[843] They had two biological children—a son, Vasily, and a daughter, Svetlana—and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921.[844] During his marriage to Nadezhda, secondnameplaceholder had affairs with many other women, most of whom were fellow revolutionaries or their wives.[845] Nadezdha suspected that this was the case,[846] and committed suicide in 1932.[847] secondnameplaceholder regarded Vasily as spoiled and often chastised his behaviour; as secondnameplaceholder's son, Vasily nevertheless was swiftly promoted through the ranks of the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle.[848] Conversely, secondnameplaceholder had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood,[849] and was also very fond of Artyom.[844] In later life, he disapproved of Svetlana's various suitors and husbands, putting a strain on his relationship with her.[850] After the Second World War, he made little time for his children and his family played a decreasingly important role in his life.[851] After secondnameplaceholder's death, Svetlana changed her surname from secondnameplaceholder to Allilueva,[671] and defected to the U.S.[852]After Nadezdha's death, secondnameplaceholder became increasingly close to her sister-in-law Zhenya Alliluyeva;[853] Montefiore believed that they were probably lovers.[854] There are unproven rumours that from 1934 onward he had a relationship with his housekeeper Valentina Istomina.[855] secondnameplaceholder had at least two illegitimate children,[856] although he never recognised them as being his.[857] One of them, Konstantin Kuzakov, later taught philosophy at the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute, but never met his father.[858] The other, Alexander, was the son of Lidia Pereprygia; he was raised as the son of a peasant fisherman and the Soviet authorities made him swear never to reveal that secondnameplaceholder was his biological father.[859]
<h2>Legacy</h2>
The historian Robert Conquest stated that secondnameplaceholder perhaps "determined the course of the twentieth century" more than any other individual.[860] Biographers like Service and Volkogonov have considered him an outstanding and exceptional politician;[861] Montefiore labelled secondnameplaceholder as "that rare combination: both 'intellectual' and killer", a man who was "the ultimate politician" and "the most elusive and fascinating of the twentieth-century titans".[862] According to historian Kevin McDermott, interpretations of secondnameplaceholder range from "the sycophantic and adulatory to the vitriolic and condemnatory."[863] For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer;[863] for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder.[863]secondnameplaceholder strengthened and stabilised the Soviet Union.[864] Service suggested that the country might have collapsed long before 1991 without secondnameplaceholder.[864] In under three decades, secondnameplaceholder transformed the Soviet Union into a major industrial world power,[865] one which could "claim impressive achievements" in terms of urbanisation, military strength, education and Soviet pride.[866] Under his rule, the average Soviet life expectancy grew due to improved living conditions, nutrition and medical care[867] as mortality rates also declined.[868] Although millions of Soviet citizens despised him, support for secondnameplaceholder was nevertheless widespread throughout Soviet society.[866] secondnameplaceholder's necessity for Soviet Union's economic development has been questioned, with it being argued that secondnameplaceholder's policies from 1928 on may have only been a limiting factor.[869]secondnameplaceholder's Soviet Union has been characterised as a totalitarian state,[870] with secondnameplaceholder its authoritarian leader.[871] Various biographers have described him as a dictator,[872] an autocrat,[873] or accused him of practicing Caesarism.[874] Montefiore argued that while secondnameplaceholder initially ruled as part of a Communist Party oligarchy, the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship in 1934,[875] with secondnameplaceholder only becoming "absolute dictator" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were eliminated.[876] According to Kotkin, secondnameplaceholder "built a personal dictatorship within the Bolshevik dictatorship."[717] In both the Soviet Union and elsewhere he came to be portrayed as an "Oriental despot".[877] Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as "one of the most powerful figures in human history."[878] McDermott stated that secondnameplaceholder had "concentrated unprecedented political authority in his hands."[879] Service stated that secondnameplaceholder "had come closer to personal despotism than almost any monarch in history" by the late 1930s.[880]McDermott nevertheless cautioned against "over-simplistic stereotypes"—promoted in the fiction of writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vasily Grossman, and Anatoly Rybakov—that portrayed secondnameplaceholder as an omnipotent and omnipresent tyrant who controlled every aspect of Soviet life through repression and totalitarianism.[881] Service similarly warned of the portrayal of secondnameplaceholder as an "unimpeded despot", noting that "powerful though he was, his powers were not limitless", and his rule depended on his willingness to conserve the Soviet structure he had inherited.[882] Kotkin observed that secondnameplaceholder's ability to remain in power relied on him having a majority in the Politburo at all times.[883] Khlevniuk noted that at various points, particularly when secondnameplaceholder was old and frail, there were "periodic manifestations" in which the party oligarchy threatened his autocratic control.[777] secondnameplaceholder denied to foreign visitors that he was a dictator, stating that those who labelled him such did not understand the Soviet governance structure.[884]A vast literature devoted to secondnameplaceholder has been produced.[885] During secondnameplaceholder's lifetime, his approved biographies were largely hagiographic in content.[886] secondnameplaceholder ensured that these works gave very little attention to his early life, particularly because he did not wish to emphasise his Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians.[887] Since his death many more biographies have been written,[888] although until the 1980s these relied largely on the same sources of information.[888] Under Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet administration various previously classified files on secondnameplaceholder's life were made available to historians,[888] at which point secondnameplaceholder became "one of the most urgent and vital issues on the public agenda" in the Soviet Union.[889] After the dissolution of the Union in 1991, the rest of the archives were opened to historians, resulting in much new information about secondnameplaceholder coming to light,[890] and producing a flood of new research.[885]Leninists remain divided in their views on secondnameplaceholder; some view him as Lenin's authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them.[716] The socio-economic nature of secondnameplaceholder's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of state socialism, state capitalism, bureaucratic collectivism, or a totally unique mode of production.[891] Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that secondnameplaceholder's actions damaged "the enormous appeal of socialism generated by the October Revolution".[892]With a high number of excess deaths occurring under his rule, secondnameplaceholder has been labeled "one of the most notorious figures in history."[864] These deaths occurred as a result of collectivisation, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under secondnameplaceholder were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of secondnameplaceholderism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to the regime.[893]Official records reveal 799,455 documented executions in the Soviet Union between 1921 and 1953; 681,692 of these were carried out between 1937 and 1938, the years of the Great Purge.[894] According to Michael Ellman, the best modern estimate for the number of repression deaths during the Great Purge is 950,000–1.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention, or soon after their release.[895] In addition, while archival data shows that 1,053,829 perished in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953,[896] the current historical consensus is that of the 18 million people who passed through the Gulag system from 1930 to 1953, between 1.5 and 1.7 million died as a result of their incarceration.[897] Historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft and Michael Ellman attribute roughly 3 million deaths to the secondnameplaceholderist regime, including executions and deaths from criminal negligence.[898] Wheatcroft and historian R. W. Davies estimate famine deaths at 5.5–6.5 million[899] while scholar Steven Rosefielde gives a number of 8.7 million.[900] In 2011, historian Timothy D. Snyder in 2011 summarised modern data made after the opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s and states that secondnameplaceholder's regime was responsible for 9 million deaths, with 6 million of these being deliberate killings. He further states the estimate is far lower than the estimates of 20 million or above which were made before access to the archives.[901]Historians continue to debate whether or not the 1932–33 Ukrainian famine, known in Ukraine as the Holodomor, should be called a genocide.[902] Twenty six countries officially recognise it under the legal definition of genocide. In 2006, the Ukrainian Parliament declared it to be such,[903] and in 2010 a Ukrainian court posthumously convicted secondnameplaceholder, Lazar Kaganovich, Stanislav Kosior, and other Soviet leaders of genocide.[904] Popular among some Ukrainian nationalists is the idea that secondnameplaceholder consciously organised the famine to suppress national desires among the Ukrainian people. This interpretation has been disputed by more recent historical studies.[905] These have articulated the view that while secondnameplaceholder's policies contributed significantly to the high mortality rate, there is no evidence that secondnameplaceholder or the Soviet government consciously engineered the famine.[906] The idea that this was a targeted attack on the Ukrainians is complicated by the widespread suffering that also affected other Soviet peoples in the famine, including the Russians.[907] Within Ukraine, ethnic Poles and Bulgarians died in similar proportions to ethnic Ukrainians.[908] Despite any lack of clear intent on secondnameplaceholder's part, the historian Norman Naimark noted that although there may not be sufficient "evidence to convict him in an international court of justice as a genocidaire [...] that does not mean that the event itself cannot be judged as genocide."[909]Shortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-secondnameplaceholderization. Malenkov denounced the secondnameplaceholder personality cult,[910] which was subsequently criticised in Pravda.[911] In 1956, Khrushchev gave his "Secret Speech", titled "On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences", to a closed session of the Party's 20th Congress. There, Khrushchev denounced secondnameplaceholder for both his mass repression and his personality cult.[912] He repeated these denunciations at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962.[913] In October 1961, secondnameplaceholder's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis next to the Kremlin walls, the location marked only by a simple bust.[914] secondnameplaceholdergrad was renamed Volgograd.[915]Khrushchev's de-secondnameplaceholderisation process in Soviet society ended when he was replaced as leader by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964; the latter introduced a level of re-secondnameplaceholderisation within the Soviet Union.[916] In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of secondnameplaceholder's legacy but on both occasions were defeated by critics within the Soviet and international Marxist–Leninist movement.[917] Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of secondnameplaceholder as necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society.[918] After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the first President of the new Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, continued Gorbachev's denunciation of secondnameplaceholder but added to it a denunciation of Lenin.[918] His successor Vladimir Putin did not seek to rehabilitate secondnameplaceholder but emphasised the celebration of Soviet achievements under secondnameplaceholder's leadership rather than the secondnameplaceholderist repressions.[919] In October 2017, Putin opened the Wall of Grief memorial in Moscow, noting that the "terrible past" would neither be "justified by anything" nor "erased from the national memory."[920]Amid the social and economic turmoil of the post-Soviet period, many Russians viewed secondnameplaceholder as having overseen an era of order, predictability, and pride.[921] He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II,[922] and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right.[923] In the 2008 Name of Russia television show, secondnameplaceholder was voted as the third most notable personality in Russian history.[924]Polling by the Levada Center suggest secondnameplaceholder's popularity has grown since 2015, with 46% of Russians expressing a favourable view of him in 2017 and 51% in 2019.[925] The Center, in 2019, reports that around 70% of Russians believe that secondnameplaceholder played a positive role in their homeland[926] and in May 2021, a survey finds that secondnameplaceholder is the most important personality in Russian public opinion, followed by Vladimir Lenin and Alexander Pushkin.[927] At the same time, there was a growth in pro-secondnameplaceholderist literature in Russia, much relying upon the misrepresentation or fabrication of source material.[928] In this literature, secondnameplaceholder's repressions are regarded either as a necessary measure to defeat "enemies of the people" or the result of lower-level officials acting without secondnameplaceholder's knowledge.[928]The only part of the former Soviet Union where admiration for secondnameplaceholder has remained consistently widespread is Georgia, although Georgian attitude has been very divided.[929] A number of Georgians resent criticism of secondnameplaceholder, the most famous figure from their nation's modern history.[922] A 2013 survey by Tbilisi State University found 45% of Georgians expressing "a positive attitude" to him.[930] A 2017 Pew Research survey had 57% of Georgians saying he played a positive role in history, compared to 18% of those expressing the same for Mikhail Gorbachev.[931]Some positive sentiment can also be found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. A 2012 survey commissioned by the Carnegie Endowment found 38% of Armenians concurring that their country "will always have need of a leader like secondnameplaceholder."[932] In early 2010, a new monument to secondnameplaceholder was erected in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.[933] In December 2010, unknown persons cut off its head and it was destroyed in an explosion in 2011.[934] In a 2016 Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll, 38% of respondents had a negative attitude to secondnameplaceholder, 26% a neutral one and 17% a positive, with 19% refusing to answer.[935]

firstnameplaceholderland Phillip secondnameplaceholder (born August 30, 1982), is the second child of William and Faith (née Zuranski) secondnameplaceholder. He has an older sister, Kristin. His parents were both Spanish teachers. Faith taught Spanish at Springfield High School, and William taught at Thurston High School and Lane Community College.[11]There was a widespread history of serious mental illnesses in both sides of the family. The parents concealed this from psychologists.[12]According to all accounts, secondnameplaceholder's parents were loving and supportive. His sister Kristin was a gifted student. The secondnameplaceholder family spent a sabbatical year in Spain when firstnameplaceholder was six, where he attended a Spanish-speaking kindergarten. secondnameplaceholder reportedly attended in an "unnormal" way, and his family said that he struggled with the curriculum.[1] When secondnameplaceholder returned to Oregon, he attended elementary school in the small community of Walterville, about five miles east of Springfield. His teachers considered him immature and lacking physical and emotional development. Based on the recommendation of his teachers, secondnameplaceholder's parents had him repeat the first grade.[1] In the repeat, he was diagnosed with dyslexia, which became worse, and he was placed in extensive special education classes by the beginning of second grade.secondnameplaceholder had an interest in firearms and explosives from an early age. His father initially discouraged this, but later enrolled him at gun safety courses, buying him a .22 caliber rifle and eventually a 9mm Glock handgun at the age of 15.[1]Classmates described secondnameplaceholder as strange and morbid. Others characterized him as psychotic or schizoid, and as someone who enjoyed listening to rock bands such as Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, and Marilyn Manson.[13][14][15] He constantly talked about committing acts of violence, telling friends that he wanted to join the U.S. Army after graduation to find out what it was like to kill someone. When asked about a family trip to Disneyland, he commented that he wanted to "punch Mickey Mouse in the nose."[16] He once gave a "how-to" speech in bomb-making to his speech class and set off "stink bombs" in the lockers of classmates. secondnameplaceholder studied William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet in his English class and related with the protagonists, and became enamored with the 1996 modernized film adaptation, which featured heavy use of firearms.secondnameplaceholder's parents enrolled him in anger management and had him evaluated by psychologists. Shortly before being murdered, secondnameplaceholder's father confided to a friend that he was "terrified" and had run out of options to help his son.[17]secondnameplaceholder exhibited signs of paranoid schizophrenia, the full extent of which became apparent only after his trial. The youth had gone to great lengths to hide any symptoms due to a fear of being labelled abnormal or mentally retarded. His doctors later said that secondnameplaceholder had told them of hearing voices in his head from the age of 12; he eventually suffered from hallucinations and paranoid delusions — including the belief that the government had implanted a computer chip in his brain.[18] secondnameplaceholder described three voices: "Voice A," who commanded secondnameplaceholder to commit violent acts, "Voice B," who repeated insulting and depressive statements at the expense of secondnameplaceholder, and "Voice C," who constantly echoed what A and B said. secondnameplaceholder claimed that he felt punished by God for being subjected to these voices, and that it was Voice A who instigated the killing of his father, mother, and the subsequent attack at Thurston High School.[19]At the police station, secondnameplaceholder lunged at officer Al Warthen with his knife, screaming, "Shoot me, kill me!" The officer repelled secondnameplaceholder with pepper spray. secondnameplaceholder later said that he wanted to trick the officer into shooting him, and that he had wanted to die by suicide after killing his parents but could not bring himself to do so.At his sentencing, the defense presented experts on mental health to show that the assailant was mentally ill. Jeffrey Hicks, the only psychologist who had treated secondnameplaceholder before the shootings, said that he was in satisfactory mental health. He had seen secondnameplaceholder for nine sessions and treated him for major depression. The boy's parents terminated the therapy because secondnameplaceholder was responding well to treatment and ceased to show symptoms of depression.[20]On September 24, 1999, three days before jury selection was set to begin, secondnameplaceholder pleaded guilty to murder and attempted murder, forgoing the possibility of being acquitted by reason of insanity. In November 1999, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to more than 111 years in prison without the possibility of parole. At sentencing, secondnameplaceholder apologized to the court for the murder of his parents and the shooting spree.[6]In June 2007, secondnameplaceholder sought a new trial, saying that his previous attorneys should have taken the case to trial and used the insanity defense. Two psychiatrists testified that secondnameplaceholder exhibited signs of paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the shooting.[18] In August 2007, a Marion County judge denied him a new trial. secondnameplaceholder appealed, arguing among other things that he had had ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial proceedings. On January 12, 2011, the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court judgment, denying his motion for a new trial.[21] secondnameplaceholder has appealed his sentence in both federal and state courts. In federal court he claimed his guilty plea should not have been accepted without a prior mental health evaluation. In state court, secondnameplaceholder challenged the validity of the virtual life sentence he was given, citing Miller v. Alabama. Shortly before he was to go to trial, secondnameplaceholder abandoned an insanity defense and accepted a plea deal to serve 25 years for shooting his parents, William secondnameplaceholder, 59, and Faith secondnameplaceholder, 57, and two Thurston High School students Mikael Nickolauson, 17, and Ben Walker, 16. But the deal also allowed a Lane County judge to tack on 40 months for each of the 26 attempted murder counts secondnameplaceholder faced for wounding the other students and lunging at an officer with a knife once in custody which added up to 111 years in prison.[22]secondnameplaceholder is incarcerated at the Oregon State Correctional Institution in Salem. He received his GED while serving a portion of his ‘life sentence’ at MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility in Woodburn. On June 11, 2007, secondnameplaceholder, nearing his 25th birthday (the maximum age to be held as a juvenile in Oregon), was transferred from the Oregon Youth Authority, MacLaren Correctional Facility, to the Oregon State Correctional Institution.[23]
<h2>Events leading to shooting</h2>
On May 20, 1998, 15-year-old secondnameplaceholder was suspended pending an expulsion hearing from Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, for being in possession of a loaded, stolen handgun. A friend of secondnameplaceholder had stolen a pistol from the father of one of his friends and arranged to sell the weapon to secondnameplaceholder the night before. secondnameplaceholder paid $110 for the Beretta Model 90 .32-caliber pistol loaded with a nine-round magazine, which he then placed in a paper bag and left in his locker. When the father discovered he was missing a handgun, he reported it to the police and supplied the names of students he believed might have stolen the firearm. secondnameplaceholder's name was not on the list. The school became aware of his possible involvement and questioned him. When he was checked for weapons, he reportedly stated: "Look, I'm gonna be square with you guys; the gun's in my locker." secondnameplaceholder was suspended pending an expulsion hearing, and he and his friend were arrested. secondnameplaceholder was released from police custody and driven home by his father.At home that afternoon, secondnameplaceholder was told by his father that he would be sent to military school if he did not improve his behavior.[2] According to secondnameplaceholder's taped confession, at about 3:00 p.m., his father was seated at the kitchen counter drinking coffee. secondnameplaceholder retrieved his Ruger .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle from his bedroom and ammunition from his parents' bedroom. He then went to the kitchen and shot his father once in the back of the head, then dragged his body into the bathroom and covered it with a sheet.[1] secondnameplaceholder further stated that his mother arrived home at about 6:30 p.m., and that he met her in the garage, told her he loved her, then shot her twice in the back of the head, three times in the face, and once in the heart. He then dragged her body across the floor and covered it with a sheet.[1]Throughout the next morning, secondnameplaceholder repeatedly played a recording of "Liebestod", the final dramatic aria from Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde, on the family's sound system.[1][3] The recording was featured in the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet, and included on the compact disc (CD) of the film's soundtrack. When police arrived at the house, they found "opera music" from the soundtrack playing loudly with the CD player set to continuous play.[1] In a note secondnameplaceholder left on a coffee table in the living room, he described his motive for killing his parents thus: "I just got two felonies on my record. My parents can't take that! It would destroy them. The embarrassment would be too much for them. They couldn't live with themselves." But as the note continues, he attempts to describe his mental state: "My head just doesn't work right. God damn these VOICES inside my head. ... I have to kill people. I don't know why. ... I have no other choice."[4]
<h2>Shooting</h2>
On May 21, secondnameplaceholder drove his mother's Ford Explorer to the high school. He wore a trench coat to hide the five weapons he carried: two hunting knives, his rifle, a 9x19mm Glock 19 pistol, and a .22-caliber Ruger MK II pistol. He was carrying 1,127 rounds of ammunition.[5]secondnameplaceholder parked on North 61st Street, two blocks from the school, then jogged to the campus, entered the patio area and fired two shots, one fatally wounding Ben Walker and the other wounding Ryan Atteberry. He went to the cafeteria and, walking across it, fired the remaining 48 rounds from his rifle, wounding 24 students[6] and fatally wounding 17-year-old Mikael Nickolauson. secondnameplaceholder fired a total of 50 rounds, 37 of which struck students, and killed two.[5] 300 students were present during the event.[7]When secondnameplaceholder's rifle ran out of ammunition and he began to reload, wounded student Jacob Ryker tackled him, assisted by several other students. secondnameplaceholder drew the Glock from his belt and fired one shot before he was disarmed, injuring Ryker again as well as another student. He yelled at the students, "Just kill me!" The students restrained secondnameplaceholder until the police arrived and arrested him.[8] A total of seven students were involved in subduing and disarming secondnameplaceholder.[9] In custody, secondnameplaceholder retrieved a knife that was secured on his leg and attacked a police officer, begging to be fatally shot. The officer subdued him with pepper spray.Nickolauson died at the scene; Walker died after being transported to the hospital and kept on life support until his parents arrived. The other students, including Ryker, were also taken to the hospital with a variety of wounds. Ryker had a perforated lung, but he made a full recovery. He received the Boy Scouts of America Honor Medal with Crossed Palms for his heroism on the day of the attack.[10]In the wake of the shooting, over 200 councilors volunteered and over $400,000 of aid money was given in the form of the Thurston Healing Fund.[7] A scholarship was created for Thurston High School graduates in remembrance of the shooting. In 2003, a permanent memorial was created and dedicated at Thurston High School in memory of the event—the Thurston Memorial.[7]
<h2>Perpetrator</h2>
firstnameplaceholderland Phillip secondnameplaceholder (born August 30, 1982), is the second child of William and Faith (née Zuranski) secondnameplaceholder. He has an older sister, Kristin. His parents were both Spanish teachers. Faith taught Spanish at Springfield High School, and William taught at Thurston High School and Lane Community College.[11]There was a widespread history of serious mental illnesses in both sides of the family. The parents concealed this from psychologists.[12]According to all accounts, secondnameplaceholder's parents were loving and supportive. His sister Kristin was a gifted student. The secondnameplaceholder family spent a sabbatical year in Spain when firstnameplaceholder was six, where he attended a Spanish-speaking kindergarten. secondnameplaceholder reportedly attended in an "unnormal" way, and his family said that he struggled with the curriculum.[1] When secondnameplaceholder returned to Oregon, he attended elementary school in the small community of Walterville, about five miles east of Springfield. His teachers considered him immature and lacking physical and emotional development. Based on the recommendation of his teachers, secondnameplaceholder's parents had him repeat the first grade.[1] In the repeat, he was diagnosed with dyslexia, which became worse, and he was placed in extensive special education classes by the beginning of second grade.secondnameplaceholder had an interest in firearms and explosives from an early age. His father initially discouraged this, but later enrolled him at gun safety courses, buying him a .22 caliber rifle and eventually a 9mm Glock handgun at the age of 15.[1]Classmates described secondnameplaceholder as strange and morbid. Others characterized him as psychotic or schizoid, and as someone who enjoyed listening to rock bands such as Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, and Marilyn Manson.[13][14][15] He constantly talked about committing acts of violence, telling friends that he wanted to join the U.S. Army after graduation to find out what it was like to kill someone. When asked about a family trip to Disneyland, he commented that he wanted to "punch Mickey Mouse in the nose."[16] He once gave a "how-to" speech in bomb-making to his speech class and set off "stink bombs" in the lockers of classmates. secondnameplaceholder studied William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet in his English class and related with the protagonists, and became enamored with the 1996 modernized film adaptation, which featured heavy use of firearms.secondnameplaceholder's parents enrolled him in anger management and had him evaluated by psychologists. Shortly before being murdered, secondnameplaceholder's father confided to a friend that he was "terrified" and had run out of options to help his son.[17]secondnameplaceholder exhibited signs of paranoid schizophrenia, the full extent of which became apparent only after his trial. The youth had gone to great lengths to hide any symptoms due to a fear of being labelled abnormal or mentally retarded. His doctors later said that secondnameplaceholder had told them of hearing voices in his head from the age of 12; he eventually suffered from hallucinations and paranoid delusions — including the belief that the government had implanted a computer chip in his brain.[18] secondnameplaceholder described three voices: "Voice A," who commanded secondnameplaceholder to commit violent acts, "Voice B," who repeated insulting and depressive statements at the expense of secondnameplaceholder, and "Voice C," who constantly echoed what A and B said. secondnameplaceholder claimed that he felt punished by God for being subjected to these voices, and that it was Voice A who instigated the killing of his father, mother, and the subsequent attack at Thurston High School.[19]
<h2>Trial and imprisonment</h2>
At the police station, secondnameplaceholder lunged at officer Al Warthen with his knife, screaming, "Shoot me, kill me!" The officer repelled secondnameplaceholder with pepper spray. secondnameplaceholder later said that he wanted to trick the officer into shooting him, and that he had wanted to die by suicide after killing his parents but could not bring himself to do so.At his sentencing, the defense presented experts on mental health to show that the assailant was mentally ill. Jeffrey Hicks, the only psychologist who had treated secondnameplaceholder before the shootings, said that he was in satisfactory mental health. He had seen secondnameplaceholder for nine sessions and treated him for major depression. The boy's parents terminated the therapy because secondnameplaceholder was responding well to treatment and ceased to show symptoms of depression.[20]On September 24, 1999, three days before jury selection was set to begin, secondnameplaceholder pleaded guilty to murder and attempted murder, forgoing the possibility of being acquitted by reason of insanity. In November 1999, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced to more than 111 years in prison without the possibility of parole. At sentencing, secondnameplaceholder apologized to the court for the murder of his parents and the shooting spree.[6]In June 2007, secondnameplaceholder sought a new trial, saying that his previous attorneys should have taken the case to trial and used the insanity defense. Two psychiatrists testified that secondnameplaceholder exhibited signs of paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the shooting.[18] In August 2007, a Marion County judge denied him a new trial. secondnameplaceholder appealed, arguing among other things that he had had ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial proceedings. On January 12, 2011, the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court judgment, denying his motion for a new trial.[21] secondnameplaceholder has appealed his sentence in both federal and state courts. In federal court he claimed his guilty plea should not have been accepted without a prior mental health evaluation. In state court, secondnameplaceholder challenged the validity of the virtual life sentence he was given, citing Miller v. Alabama. Shortly before he was to go to trial, secondnameplaceholder abandoned an insanity defense and accepted a plea deal to serve 25 years for shooting his parents, William secondnameplaceholder, 59, and Faith secondnameplaceholder, 57, and two Thurston High School students Mikael Nickolauson, 17, and Ben Walker, 16. But the deal also allowed a Lane County judge to tack on 40 months for each of the 26 attempted murder counts secondnameplaceholder faced for wounding the other students and lunging at an officer with a knife once in custody which added up to 111 years in prison.[22]secondnameplaceholder is incarcerated at the Oregon State Correctional Institution in Salem. He received his GED while serving a portion of his ‘life sentence’ at MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility in Woodburn. On June 11, 2007, secondnameplaceholder, nearing his 25th birthday (the maximum age to be held as a juvenile in Oregon), was transferred from the Oregon Youth Authority, MacLaren Correctional Facility, to the Oregon State Correctional Institution.[23]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was a former U.S. Marine who assassinated United States president John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.Oswald was placed in juvenile detention at the age of 12 for truancy, during which time he was assessed by a psychiatrist as "emotionally disturbed", due to a lack of normal family life. After attending 22 schools in his youth, he quit repeatedly, and finally when he was 17, joined the Marines. Oswald was court-martialed twice while in the marines, and jailed. He was honorably released from active duty in the Marine Corps into the reserve, then promptly flew to Europe and defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959. He lived in Minsk, Belarus, married a Russian woman named Marina, and had a daughter. In June 1962, he returned to the United States with his wife, and eventually settled in Dallas, where their second daughter was also born.Oswald shot and killed Kennedy on November 22, 1963, from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository as the President traveled by motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas. About 45 minutes after assassinating Kennedy, Oswald shot and killed Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit on a local street. He then slipped into a movie theater, where he was arrested for Tippit's murder. Oswald was charged with the assassination of Kennedy, but he denied responsibility for the killing, stating that he was a "patsy".[1][2] Two days later, Oswald was fatally shot by local nightclub owner Jack Ruby on live television in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters.In September 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald had acted alone when assassinating Kennedy. This conclusion, though controversial, was supported by investigations from the Dallas Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Secret Service, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations.[n 1][3][4]Despite forensic, ballistic, and eyewitness evidence supporting the official findings, public opinion polls have shown that most Americans still do not believe that the official version tells the whole truth of the events,[5] and the assassination spawned numerous conspiracy theories.
<h2>Early life</h2>
Oswald was born at the old French Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 18, 1939, to Robert Edward firstnameplaceholder Oswald Sr. (1896–1939) and Marguerite Frances Claverie (1907–1981).[6] Robert Oswald was a distant cousin of Confederate general Robert E. firstnameplaceholder and served in the Marines during World War I.[7] Robert died of a heart attack two months before firstnameplaceholder was born.[8] firstnameplaceholder's elder brother Robert Jr. (1934–2017)[9] was also a former Marine. Through Marguerite's first marriage to Edward John Pic Jr., firstnameplaceholder and Robert Jr. were the half-brothers of Air Force veteran John Edward Pic (1932–2000).[10]In 1944, Marguerite moved the family from New Orleans to Dallas, Texas. Oswald entered the first grade in 1945 and over the next half-dozen years attended several different schools in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas through the sixth grade. Oswald took an IQ test in the fourth grade and scored 103; "on achievement tests in [grades 4 to 6], he twice did best in reading and twice did worst in spelling".[11]As a child, Oswald was described as withdrawn and temperamental by several people who knew him.[12] When Oswald was 12 in August 1952, his mother took him to New York City where they lived for a short time with Oswald's half-brother, John. Oswald and his mother were later asked to leave after an argument in which Oswald allegedly struck his mother and threatened John's wife with a pocket knife.[13][14][15]Oswald attended seventh grade in the Bronx, New York, but was often truant, which led to a psychiatric assessment at a juvenile reformatory.[16][17] The reformatory psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, described Oswald as immersed in a "vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics of omnipotence and power, through which [Oswald] tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations". Dr. Hartogs concluded:Hartogs recommended that firstnameplaceholder be placed on probation on condition that he seek help and guidance through a child guidance clinic, and that Oswald seek "psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with a family agency". Evelyn D Siegel, a social worker who interviewed both firstnameplaceholder and Oswald at Youth House, while describing "a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless youngster which grows as one speaks to him", found that he had detached himself from the world around him because "no one in it ever met any of his needs for love". Hartogs and Sigel indicated that Oswald's mother gave firstnameplaceholder very little affection, with Siegel concluding that firstnameplaceholder "just felt that his mother never gave a damn for him. He always felt like a burden that she simply just had to tolerate." Furthermore, his mother did not apparently indicate an awareness of the relationship between her conduct and firstnameplaceholder's psychological problems, with Siegel describing Marguerite Oswald as a "defensive, rigid, self-involved person who had real difficulty in accepting and relating to people" and who had "little understanding" of firstnameplaceholder's behavior and of the "protective shell he has drawn around himself". Hartogs reported that she did not understand that firstnameplaceholder's withdrawal was a form of "violent but silent protest against his neglect by her and represents his reaction to a complete absence of any real family life".[17]When firstnameplaceholder returned to school for the 1953 Fall semester, his disciplinary problems continued. When Oswald failed to cooperate with school authorities, they sought a court order to remove him from his mother's care so he could be placed into a home for boys to complete his education. This was postponed, perhaps partially because his behavior abruptly improved.[17][18] Before the New York family court system could address their case,[17][19] the Oswalds left New York in January 1954, and returned to New Orleans.[17][20]Oswald completed the eighth and ninth grades in New Orleans. He entered the 10th grade in 1955 but quit school after one month.[21] After leaving school, Oswald worked for several months as an office clerk and messenger in New Orleans. In July 1956, Oswald's mother moved the family to Fort Worth, Texas, and Oswald re-enrolled in the 10th grade for the September session at Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth. A few weeks later in October, Oswald quit school at age 17 to join the Marines;[22] he never earned a high school diploma. By this point, he had resided at 22 locations and attended 12 schools.[n 2]Though Oswald had trouble spelling in his youth[11] and may have had a "reading-spelling disability",[23] he read voraciously. By age 15, he considered himself a socialist according to his diary: "I was looking for a key to my environment, and then I discovered socialist literature. I had to dig for my books in the back dusty shelves of libraries." At 16, he wrote to the Socialist Party of America for information on their Young People's Socialist League, saying he had been studying socialist principles for "well over fifteen months".[24] However, Edward Voebel, "whom the Warren Commission had established was Oswald's closest friend during his teenage years in New Orleans ... said that reports that Oswald was already 'studying Communism' were a 'lot of baloney'". Voebel said that "Oswald commonly read 'paperback trash'".[25][26][27]As a teenager in 1955, Oswald attended Civil Air Patrol meetings in New Orleans. Fellow cadets recalled him attending C.A.P. meetings "three or four" times, or "10 or 12 times" over a one- or two-month period.[28][29][30]
<h2>Marine Corps</h2>
Oswald enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, just a week after his seventeenth birthday; because of his age, his brother Robert Jr. was required to sign as his legal guardian. Oswald also named his mother and his half-brother John as beneficiaries.[31] Oswald idolized his older brother Robert Jr.,[32] and wore his Marine Corps ring.[33] John Pic (Oswald's half-brother) testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald's enlistment was motivated by wanting "to get from out and under ... the yoke of oppression from my mother".[34]Oswald's enlistment papers recite that he was 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters) tall and weighed 135 pounds (61 kg), with hazel eyes and brown hair.[31] His primary training was in radar operation, which required a security clearance. A May 1957 document stated that he was "granted final clearance to handle classified matter up to and including confidential after careful check of local records had disclosed no derogatory data".[35]At Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, Oswald finished seventh in a class of thirty in the Aircraft Control and Warning Operator Course, which "included instruction in aircraft surveillance and the use of radar".[36] He was given the military occupational specialty of Aviation Electronics Operator.[37] On July 9, he reported to the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in California then departed for Japan the following month, where he was assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron 1 at Naval Air Facility Atsugi near Tokyo.[38]Like all marines, Oswald was trained and tested in shooting. In December 1956, he scored 212, which was slightly above the requirements for the designation of sharpshooter.[21] In May 1959 he scored 191, which reduced his rating to marksman.[21][39]Oswald was court-martialed after he accidentally shot himself in the elbow with an unauthorized .22 caliber handgun. He was court-martialed a second time for fighting with a sergeant who he thought was responsible for his punishment in the shooting matter. He was demoted from private first class to private and briefly imprisoned. Oswald was later punished for a third incident: while he was on a night-time sentry duty in the Philippines, he inexplicably fired his rifle into the jungle.[40]Slightly built, Oswald was nicknamed Ozzie Rabbit after the cartoon character; he was also called Oswaldskovich[41] because he espoused pro-Soviet sentiments. In November 1958, Oswald transferred back to El Toro[42] where his unit's function "was to serveil  [sic] for aircraft, but basically to train both enlisted men and officers for later assignment overseas". An officer there said that Oswald was a "very competent" crew chief and was "brighter than most people".[43][44]While Oswald was in the Marines, he taught himself rudimentary Russian. Although this was an unusual endeavor, on February 25, 1959, he was invited to take a Marine proficiency exam in written and spoken Russian. His level at the time was rated "poor" in understanding spoken Russian, though he fared rather reasonably for a Marine private at the time in reading and writing.[45] On September 11, 1959, he received a hardship discharge from active service, claiming his mother needed care. He was placed on the United States Marine Corps Reserve.[21][46][47]
<h2>Adult life and early crimes</h2>
Oswald traveled to the Soviet Union just before he turned 20 in October 1959. He had taught himself Russian and saved $1,500 of his Marine Corps salary (equivalent to $10,600 in 2020).[n 3] Oswald spent two days with his mother in Fort Worth, then embarked by ship on September 20 from New Orleans to Le Havre, France, and immediately traveled to the United Kingdom. Arriving in Southampton on October 9, he told officials he had $700 and planned to stay for one week before proceeding to a school in Switzerland. However, on the same day, he flew to Helsinki. In Helsinki, he checked-in at the Hotel Torni, room 309, then moved to Hotel Klaus Kurki, room 429.[48] He was issued a Soviet visa on October 14. Oswald left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the Soviet border at Vainikkala, and arrived in Moscow on October 16.[49] His visa, valid only for a week, was due to expire on October 21.[50]Almost immediately after arriving, Oswald informed his Intourist guide of his desire to become a Soviet citizen. When asked why by the various Soviet officials he encountered — all of whom, by Oswald's account, found his wish incomprehensible — he said that he was a communist, and gave what he described in his diary as "vauge [sic] answers about 'Great Soviet Union'".[50] On October 21, the day his visa was due to expire, he was told that his citizenship application had been refused, and that he had to leave the Soviet Union that evening. Distraught, Oswald inflicted a minor but bloody wound to his left wrist in his hotel room bathtub soon before his Intourist guide was due to arrive to escort him from the country, according to his diary because he wished to kill himself in a way that would shock her.[50] Delaying Oswald's departure because of his self-inflicted injury, the Soviets kept him in a Moscow hospital under psychiatric observation for a week, until October 28, 1959.[51]According to Oswald, he met with four more Soviet officials that same day, who asked if he wanted to return to the United States. Oswald replied by insisting that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union as a Soviet national. When pressed for identification papers, he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers.[52]On October 31, Oswald appeared at the United States embassy in Moscow and declared a desire to renounce his U.S. citizenship.[53][54] "I have made up my mind", he said; "I'm through."[55] He told the U.S. embassy interviewing officer, Richard Edward Snyder, that "he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and that he had voluntarily stated to unnamed Soviet officials that as a Soviet citizen he would make known to them such information concerning the Marine Corps and his specialty as he possessed. He intimated that he might know something of special interest."[56] Such statements led to Oswald's hardship/honorable military reserve discharge being changed to undesirable.[57] The story of the defection of a former U.S. Marine to the Soviet Union was reported by both the Associated Press and United Press International.[58][59]Though Oswald had wanted to attend Moscow State University, he was sent to Minsk, Belarus, to work as a lathe operator at the Gorizont Electronics Factory, which produced radios, televisions, and military and space electronics. Stanislau Shushkevich, who later became independent Belarus's first head of state, was also engaged by Gorizont at the time[clarification needed], and was assigned to teach Oswald Russian.[60] Oswald received a government-subsidized, fully furnished studio apartment in a prestigious building and an additional supplement to his factory pay, which allowed him to have a comfortable standard of living by working-class Soviet standards,[61] though he was kept under constant surveillance.[62]From approximately June 1960 to February 1961, Oswald was in a personal relationship with a Belarusian woman, Ella German (Belarusian: Эла Герман, a co-worker at the factory, born 1937).[63][10][64] She has lived most of her life in Minsk, the capital of Belarus (until 1992 part of the Soviet Union); in 2013 she was living in the Israeli town of Acre.German was born to a Jewish family in Minsk in 1937.[64] Her mother worked in a chorus line to earn money.[65] Following her father's death when quite young, her grandmother took care of her.[65] In June 1941, she was with her grandparents in Mogilev, southeast of Minsk, for the summer when German military forces invaded.[64] Fleeing the occupation, German and her grandparents eventually ended up in Mordovia, southeast of Moscow.[64] After Minsk was liberated in 1944, the family returned.[64]German described her childhood in hindsight as a miserable life, but stated that she never felt unhappy.[65] She was nineteen before she first dated.[66] German reported that theater was important to her family and that she enjoyed dancing the waltz and foxtrot as she got older,[67] and frequently performed in public theater and thought she might become an actress.[66] She tried for several years to gain admission to Minsk University, but received very low marks for the language criterion in Belarusian.[66]During the mid-1950s, German was hired as a fitter in the Gorizont (Horizon) radio and television factory in Minsk.[10][64][66] Sometime between April and June 1960[nb 1], she was working in the Experimental Department on the first floor of the factory when she met Oswald, a co-worker in the factory. According to Oswald's diary: "I noticed her, and perhaps fell in love with her, the first minute I saw her".[10][64] German would later describe him as "a pleasant-looking guy with a good sense of humor. He was not as rough and rude as the men here were back then".[69]She said, "We went to the movies, the theater, symphonies. He was easy to be with. He didn't demand anything of me".[69] The couple ate in the cafeteria together every day and dated about twice each week.[70] She said that it was difficult to trust him completely as he seemed to compartmentalize the relationships in his life.[70][nb 2] The relationship became more serious to Oswald during the summer and fall of 1960.[64]German stated in an interview that he was probably aware from their first meeting that she was Jewish, but that he mentioned it to her only once, when he broached the subject of marriage by remarking it did not matter to him that she was Jewish.[71] German reported that she had rejected at least two marriage proposals prior to her relationship with Oswald, and that he was someone she did not love or like enough to marry.[72] She wrote that she perceived Oswald as a lonely person and continued to date him out of pity, concerned that rejecting him would make him lonelier.[72]German was invited to Oswald's apartment for the first time on October 18, 1960, his twenty-first birthday.[73] According to German, a quarrel ensued when a friend of Oswald brought another woman to the gathering, making it apparent to her that he had been intimate with other women.[74] Oswald's writings indicate that he had four to five sexual encounters with the woman over the following two weeks.[74] German said she began to stop trusting Oswald after she learned in October 1960 that he had been seeing other women.[64] According to German, Oswald showed up with a gift of chocolates at her family's house on the evening of December 31, 1960, and spent New Year's Eve with them.[64] [nb 3] She stated that they had earlier quarreled about New Year's Eve plans.[75]Oswald's diary entry for January 1, 1961 indicated that he had an enjoyable time at the gathering and decided on the way home that he would propose to German.[75] On January 2, Oswald wrote that he had proposed to her and had been refused because she did not love him and because he was an American.[64][76] He concluded that German was more interested in arousing the envy of other women by having an American escort.[10][64] She has stated that she did not understand why Oswald cared so deeply for her and that she was surprised by the proposal.[64]Some authors, including Peter Savodnik and Priscilla Johnson McMillan, believe German's rejection of Oswald's marriage proposal had much to do with his disillusionment with life in the Soviet Union and his decision to return to the United States.[64][77][nb 4] Oswald formally dated German for the last time in January[78] or February 1961.[10] According to German, he ignored her at their workplace.[79] She was reported to have been surprised when learning Oswald had returned to the United States.[80]Following the assassination of United States president John F. Kennedy, German was worried that the KGB would come for her, but has stated that they never did.[81] According to novelist Norman Mailer, she said that Oswald was "so gentle" and that she could not believe he was Kennedy's assassin.[81]German was still a resident of Minsk in 1993.[69] She was interviewed by Mailer for his 1995 biography, Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery.[82] Mailer reported that German was a teacher at that time, living with and caring for her daughter and granddaughter.[66] Savodnik also interviewed her for his 2013 book, The Interloper: firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Inside the Soviet Union.[83] As of 2015, German lived in Acre, Israel.[64]
<h2>Return to the U.S.</h2>
Oswald wrote in his diary in January 1961: "I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying. The work is drab, the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling alleys, no places of recreation except the trade union dances. I have had enough."[84] Shortly afterwards, Oswald (who had never formally renounced his U.S. citizenship) wrote to the Embassy of the United States, Moscow requesting the return of his American passport, and proposing to return to the U.S. if any charges against him would be dropped.[85]In March 1961, Oswald met Marina Prusakova (b. 1941), a 19-year-old pharmacology student; they married six weeks later.[n 4][86] The Oswalds' first child, June, was born on February 15, 1962. On May 24, 1962, Oswald and Marina applied at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for documents that enabled her to immigrate to the U.S. On June 1, the U.S. Embassy gave Oswald a repatriation loan of $435.71.[87] Oswald, Marina, and their infant daughter left for the United States, where they received less attention from the press than Oswald expected.[88]The Oswalds soon settled in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, where firstnameplaceholder's mother and brother lived. firstnameplaceholder began a manuscript on Soviet life, though he eventually gave up the project.[89] The Oswalds also became acquainted with a number of anti-Communist Russian and East European émigrés in the area.[90][91] In testimony to the Warren Commission, Alexander Kleinlerer said that the Russian émigrés sympathized with Marina, while merely tolerating Oswald, whom they regarded as rude and arrogant.[n 5]Although the Russian émigrés eventually abandoned Marina when she made no sign of leaving her husband,[92] Oswald found an unlikely friend in 51-year-old Russian émigré George de Mohrenschildt, a well-educated petroleum geologist with international business connections.[93][94] A native of Russia, Mohrenschildt later told the Warren Commission that Oswald had a "remarkable fluency in Russian".[95] Marina, meanwhile, befriended Ruth Paine,[96] a Quaker trying to learn Russian, and her husband Michael Paine, who worked for Bell Helicopter.[97]In July 1962, Oswald was hired by the Leslie Welding Company in Dallas; he disliked the work and quit after three months. On October 12, he started working for the graphic-arts firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall as a photoprint trainee. A fellow employee at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall testified that Oswald's rudeness at his new job was such that fights threatened to break out, and that he once saw Oswald reading a Russian-language publication.[98][n 6] Oswald was fired in the first week of April 1963.[99]In March 1963, Oswald used the alias "A. Hidell" to make a mail-order purchase of a secondhand 6.5 mm caliber Carcano rifle for $29.95.[100] He also purchased a .38 Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver by the same method.[101] The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald attempted to kill retired U.S. Major General Edwin Walker on April 10, 1963, and that Oswald fired the Carcano rifle at Walker through a window from less than 100 feet (30 m) away as Walker sat at a desk in his Dallas home. The bullet struck the window-frame and Walker's only injuries were bullet fragments to the forearm.[102] The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations stated that the "evidence strongly suggested" that Oswald carried out the shooting.[103]General Walker was an outspoken anti-communist, segregationist, and member of the John Birch Society. In 1961, Walker had been relieved of his command of the 24th Division of the U.S. Army in West Germany for distributing right-wing literature to his troops.[104][105] Walker's later actions in opposition to racial integration at the University of Mississippi led to his arrest on insurrection, seditious conspiracy, and other charges. He was temporarily held in a mental institution on orders from President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, but a grand jury declined to indict him.[106]Marina Oswald testified that her husband told her that he traveled by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle.[107][108] She said that Oswald considered Walker to be the leader of a "fascist organization".[109] A note Oswald left for Marina on the night of the attempt, telling her what to do if he did not return, was found ten days after the Kennedy assassination.[110][111][112][113]Before the Kennedy assassination, Dallas police had no suspects in the Walker shooting,[114] but Oswald's involvement was suspected within hours of his arrest following the assassination.[115] The Walker bullet was too damaged to run conclusive ballistics studies on it,[116] but neutron activation analysis later showed that it was "extremely likely" that it was made by the same manufacturer and for the same rifle make as the two bullets which later struck Kennedy.[n 7]George de Mohrenschildt testified that he "knew that Oswald disliked General Walker".[117] Regarding this, de Mohrenschildt and his wife Jeanne recalled an incident that occurred the weekend following the Walker assassination attempt. The de Mohrenschildts testified that on April 14, 1963, just before Easter Sunday, they were visiting the Oswalds at their new apartment and had brought them a toy Easter bunny to give to their child. As Oswald's wife Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle standing upright, leaning against the wall inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, "Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?" When asked about Oswald's reaction to this question, George de Mohrenschildt told the Warren Commission that Oswald "smiled at that".[118] When George's wife Jeanne was asked about Oswald's reaction, she said, "I didn't notice anything"; she continued, "we started laughing our heads off, big joke, big George's joke".[119] Jeanne de Mohrenschildt testified that this was the last time she or her husband ever saw the Oswalds.[120][121]Oswald returned to New Orleans on April 24, 1963.[122] Marina's friend Ruth Paine drove her by car from Dallas to join Oswald in New Orleans the following month.[123] On May 10, Oswald was hired by the Reily Coffee Company as a machinery greaser.[124] He was fired in July "because his work was not satisfactory and because he spent too much time loitering in Adrian Alba's garage next door, where he read rifle and hunting magazines".[125]On May 26, Oswald wrote to the New York City headquarters of the pro-Fidel Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, proposing to rent "a small office at my own expense for the purpose of forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans".[126] Three days later, the FPCC responded to Oswald's letter advising against opening a New Orleans office "at least not ... at the very beginning".[127] In a follow-up letter, Oswald replied, "Against your advice, I have decided to take an office from the very beginning."[128]On May 29, Oswald ordered the following items from a local printer: 500 application forms, 300 membership cards, and 1,000 leaflets with the heading, "Hands Off Cuba".[129] According to Marina, firstnameplaceholder told her to sign the name "A.J. Hidell" as chapter president on his membership card.[130]According to anti-Castro militant Carlos Bringuier, Oswald visited him on August 5 and 6 at a store he owned in New Orleans. Bringuier was the New Orleans delegate for the anti-Castro organization Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE). Bringuier would later tell the Warren Commission that he believed Oswald's visits were an attempt by Oswald to infiltrate his group.[131] On August 9, Oswald turned up in downtown New Orleans handing out pro-Castro leaflets. Bringuier confronted Oswald, claiming he was tipped off about Oswald's leafleting by a friend. A scuffle ensued and Oswald, Bringuier, and two of Bringuier's friends were arrested for disturbing the peace.[132][133] Prior to leaving the police station, Oswald requested to speak with an FBI agent.[134] Oswald told the agent that he was a member of the New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee which he claimed had 35 members and was led by A. J. Hidell.[134] In fact, Oswald was the branch's only member and it had never been chartered by the national organization.[135]A week later, on August 16, Oswald again passed out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets with two hired helpers, this time in front of the International Trade Mart. The incident was filmed by WDSU, a local TV station.[136] The next day, Oswald was interviewed by WDSU radio commentator William Stuckey, who probed Oswald's background.[137][138] A few days later, Oswald accepted Stuckey's invitation to take part in a radio debate with Carlos Bringuier and Bringuier's associate Edward Scannell Butler, head of the right-wing Information Council of the Americas (INCA).[137][139][140]Marina's friend Ruth Paine transported Marina and her child by car from New Orleans to the Paine home in Irving, Texas, near Dallas, on September 23, 1963.[123][141] Oswald stayed in New Orleans at least two more days to collect a $33 unemployment check. It is uncertain when he left New Orleans; he is next known to have boarded a bus in Houston on September 26 — bound for the Mexican border, rather than Dallas — and to have told other bus passengers that he planned to travel to Cuba via Mexico.[142][143] He arrived in Mexico City on September 27, where he applied for a transit visa at the Cuban Embassy,[144] claiming he wanted to visit Cuba on his way to the Soviet Union. The Cuban embassy officials insisted Oswald would need Soviet approval, but he was unable to get prompt co-operation from the Soviet embassy. CIA documents note Oswald spoke "terrible hardly recognizable Russian" during his meetings with Cuban and Soviet officials.[145]After five days of shuttling between consulates — and including a heated argument with an official at the Cuban consulate, impassioned pleas to KGB agents, and at least some CIA scrutiny[146] — Oswald was told by a Cuban consular officer that he was disinclined to approve the visa, saying "a person like [Oswald] in place of aiding the Cuban Revolution, was doing it harm".[147] Later, on October 18, the Cuban embassy approved the visa, but by this time Oswald was back in the United States and had given up on his plans to visit Cuba and the Soviet Union. Still later, eleven days before the assassination of President Kennedy, Oswald wrote to the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., saying, "Had I been able to reach the Soviet Embassy in Havana, as planned, the embassy there would have had time to complete our business."[148][149]While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald had visited Mexico City and the Cuban and Soviet consulates, questions regarding whether someone posing as Oswald had appeared at the embassies were serious enough to be investigated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Later, the Committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald had visited Mexico City and concluded that "the majority of evidence tends to indicate" that Oswald visited the consulates, but the Committee could not rule out the possibility that someone else had used his name in visiting the consulates.[150]According to a CIA document released in 2017, it is possible Oswald was trying to get the necessary documents from the embassies to make a quick escape to the Soviet Union after the assassination.[145]On October 2, 1963, Oswald left Mexico City by bus and arrived in Dallas the next day. Ruth Paine said that her neighbor told her on October 14 about a job opening at the Texas School Book Depository, where her neighbor's brother, Wesley Frazier, worked. Mrs. Paine informed Oswald, who was interviewed at the depository and was hired there on October 16 as a $1.25 an hour minimum wage order filler.[151] Oswald's supervisor, Roy S. Truly (1907–1985), said that Oswald "did a good day's work" and was an above-average employee.[152][153] During the week, Oswald stayed in a Dallas rooming house under the name "O. H. firstnameplaceholder",[154] but he spent his weekends with Marina at the Paine home in Irving. Oswald did not drive a car, but he commuted to and from Dallas on Mondays and Fridays with his co-worker Wesley Frazier. On October 20 (a month before the assassination), the Oswalds' second daughter, Audrey, was born.[155][156]The Dallas branch of the FBI became interested in Oswald after its agent learned that the CIA had determined that Oswald had been in contact with the Soviet embassy in Mexico, making Oswald a possible espionage case.[157] FBI agents twice visited the Paine home in early November, when Oswald was not present, and spoke to Mrs. Paine.[158] Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about two to three weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent James P. Hosty. When he was told that Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, according to the receptionist, read: "Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife" [signed] "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder". The note allegedly contained a threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to "blow up the FBI" or merely "report this to higher authorities". According to Hosty, the note said, "If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.[159][160]
<h2>John F. Kennedy and J. D. Tippit shootings</h2>
In the days before Kennedy's arrival, several local newspapers published the route of the presidential motorcade, which passed the Texas School Book Depository.[161] On Thursday, November 21, 1963, Oswald asked Frazier for an unusual mid-week lift back to Irving, saying he had to pick up some curtain rods. The next morning (the day of the assassination), he returned to Dallas with Frazier. He left $170 and his wedding ring,[162] but took a large paper bag with him. Frazier reported that Oswald told him the bag contained curtain rods.[163][164] The Warren Commission concluded that the package of "curtain rods" actually contained the rifle that Oswald was going to use for the assassination.[165][166][167][168][169][170][171][172]One of Oswald's co-workers, Charles Givens, testified to the Commission that he last saw Oswald on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository (TSBD) at approximately 11:55 a.m., which was 35 minutes before the motorcade entered Dealey Plaza.[n 8] The Commission report stated that Oswald was not seen again "until after the shooting".[173] However, in an FBI report taken the day after the assassination, Givens said that the encounter took place at 11:30 a.m. and that he saw Oswald reading a newspaper in the first floor domino room at 11:50 a.m, 20 minutes later.[174][175] William Shelley, a foreman at the depository, also testified that he saw Oswald making a phone call on the first floor between 11:45 and 11:50 a.m.[176] Janitor Eddie Piper also testified that he spoke to Oswald on the first floor at 12:00 p.m.[177] Another co-worker, Bonnie Ray Williams, was eating his lunch on the sixth floor of the depository and was there until at least 12:10 p.m.[178] He said that during that time, he did not see Oswald, or anyone else, on the sixth floor and thought that he was the only person up there.[179] However, he also said that some boxes in the southeast corner may have prevented him from seeing deep into the "sniper's nest".[180] Carolyn Arnold, the secretary to the Vice President of the TSBD, informed the FBI that as she left the building to watch the motorcade, she caught a glimpse of a man whom she believed to be Oswald standing in the first floor hallway of the building just prior to the assassination.[181][n 9]As Kennedy's motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza at about 12:30 p.m. on November 22, Oswald fired three rifle shots from the sixth-floor window of the book depository,[182] killing the President and seriously wounding Texas Governor John Connally. One shot apparently missed the presidential limousine entirely, another struck both Kennedy and Connally, and a third bullet struck Kennedy in the head,[183] killing him. Bystander James Tague received a minor facial injury from a small piece of curbstone that had fragmented after it was struck by one of the bullets.Witness Howard Brennan was sitting across the street from the Texas School Book Depository and watching the motorcade go by. He notified police that he heard a shot come from above and looked up to see a man with a rifle fire another shot from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking through the window.[184] Brennan gave a description of the shooter,[185] and Dallas police subsequently broadcast descriptions at 12:45 p.m., 12:48 p.m., and 12:55 p.m.[186] After the second shot was fired, Brennan recalled, "This man I saw previous[ly] was aiming for his last shot ... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark."[187]Six Dallas police officers, including Lieutenant J. C. Day, found the long bag which Frazier described near the sixth floor depository window where Oswald was determined to have fired gunshots at President Kennedy, with Day writing "Found next to the sixth floor window gun fired from. May have been used to carry gun."[164] The bag was 38 inches long and had marks on the inside consistent with those of a rifle.[164] A Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and three shell casings were found near the open sixth floor window as well.[188][189][190][191][192]According to the investigations, Oswald hid and covered the rifle with boxes after the shooting and descended through the rear stairwell. About 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Oswald was encountered in the second-floor lunchroom by Dallas police officer Marrion L. Baker, who had his gun drawn. The patrolman was accompanied by Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly. Baker made the mistake of letting Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee; Baker and Truly incorrectly assumed that Oswald was not a suspect because he was an employee of the building. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be "nervous" or "out of breath".[193] Truly said that Oswald looked "startled" when Baker pointed his gun directly at him.[194][195] Mrs. Robert Reid, a clerical supervisor at the depository who returned to her office within two minutes after the shooting, said that she saw Oswald "was very calm" on the second floor with a can of Coca-Cola in his hands.[196] As they walked past each other, Mrs. Reid said to Oswald, "The President has been shot" to which he mumbled something in response, but Reid did not understand him.[197] Oswald was believed to have left the depository through the front entrance just before police sealed it off. Truly later pointed out to officers that Oswald was the only employee that he was certain was missing.[198][199]At about 12:40 p.m., 10 minutes after the shooting, Oswald boarded a city bus. Probably due to heavy traffic, he requested a transfer from the driver and got off two blocks later.[200] Oswald then took a taxicab to his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley Avenue and entered through the front door at about 1:00 p.m. According to his housekeeper Earlene Roberts, Oswald immediately went to his room, "walking pretty fast".[201] Roberts said that Oswald left "a very few minutes" later, zipping up a jacket he was not wearing when he had entered earlier. As Oswald left, Roberts looked out of the window of her house and last saw him standing at the northbound Beckley Avenue bus stop in front of her house.[202][203]The Warren Commission concluded that at approximately 1:15 p.m., Dallas Patrolman J. D. Tippit drove up in his patrol car alongside Oswald, presumably because Oswald resembled the police broadcast description of the man seen by witness Howard Brennan who fired shots at the presidential motorcade. He encountered Oswald near the corner of East 10th Street and North Patton Avenue.[204][205] This location is about nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 km) southeast of Oswald's rooming house — a distance that the Warren Commission concluded "Oswald could have easily walked".[206] Tippit pulled alongside Oswald and "apparently exchanged words with [him] through the right front or vent window".[207] "Shortly after 1:15 p.m.",[n 10] Tippit exited his car. Oswald immediately fired his pistol and killed the policeman with four shots.[207][208] Numerous witnesses heard the shots and saw Oswald flee the scene holding a revolver; nine positively identified him as the man who shot Tippit and fled.[209][n 11] Four cartridge cases found at the scene were identified by expert witnesses[210] before the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee as having been fired from the revolver later found in Oswald's possession, excluding all other weapons. However, the bullets taken from Tippit's body could not be positively identified as having been fired from Oswald's revolver as the bullets were too extensively damaged to make conclusive assessments.[210][211]Shoe store manager Johnny Brewer testified that he saw Oswald "ducking into" the entrance alcove of his store. Suspicious of this activity, Brewer watched Oswald continue up the street and slip without paying into the nearby Texas Theatre, where the film War Is Hell was playing.[212] He alerted the theater's ticket clerk, who telephoned police[213] at about 1:40 p.m.As police arrived, the house lights were brought up and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near the rear of the theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that he was the first to reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to surrender saying, "Well, it is all over now." McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed.[214][215] As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.[216]At about 2 p.m., Oswald was taken to the Police Department building, where homicide detective Jim Leavelle questioned him about the shooting of Officer Tippit. When Captain J. W. Fritz heard Oswald's name, he recognized it as that of the book depository employee who had been reported missing and was already a suspect in the assassination.[217][218] Oswald was formally arraigned for the murder of Officer Tippit at 7:10 p.m., and by early the next morning (shortly after 1:30 a.m.) he had also been arraigned for the assassination of President Kennedy.[219][220]Soon after his arrest, Oswald encountered reporters in a hallway. Oswald declared, "I didn't shoot anybody" and, "They've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!"[221] Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, "Did you kill the President?" and Oswald — who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death — answered, "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." As he was led from the room the question was called out, "What did you do in Russia?" and, "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, "A policeman hit me."[222][223]
<h2>Police interrogation</h2>
Oswald was interrogated several times during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He admitted that he went to his rooming house after leaving the book depository. He also admitted that he changed his clothes and armed himself with a .38 revolver before leaving his house to go to the theater.[227] However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, and said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes. He denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch). He also denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination. Oswald denied knowing an "A. J. Hidell". Oswald was then shown a forged Selective Service System card bearing his photograph and the alias, "Alek James Hidell" that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest. Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying "you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as I do".[228][229]FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) conducted the first interrogation of Oswald on Friday, November 22. When Oswald was asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, he replied that he was eating his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the "domino room"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn.[230][231][232][233] Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two "Negro employees" walking by, one he recognized as "Junior" and a shorter man whose name he could not recall.[234] Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had "walked through" the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody else was there, but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there.[235][236] During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was at the time of the shooting. Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker.[237]Oswald asked for legal representation several times during the interrogation, and he also asked for assistance during encounters with reporters. When H. Louis Nichols, President of the Dallas Bar Association, met with him in his cell on Saturday, he declined their services, saying he wanted to be represented by John Abt, chief counsel to the Communist Party USA, or by lawyers associated with the American Civil Liberties Union.[238][239] Both Oswald and Ruth Paine tried to reach Abt by telephone several times Saturday and Sunday,[240][241] but Abt was away for the weekend.[242] Oswald also declined his brother Robert's offer on Saturday to obtain a local attorney.[243]During an interrogation with Captain Fritz, when asked, "Are you a communist?", he replied, "No, I am not a communist. I am a Marxist."[244][245][246]
<h2>Murder</h2>
On Sunday, November 24, detectives were escorting Oswald through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters toward an armored car that was to take him from the city jail (located on the fourth floor of police headquarters) to the nearby county jail. At 11:21 a.m. CST, Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby approached Oswald from the side of the crowd and shot him once in the abdomen at close range.[247] As the shot rang out, a police detective suddenly recognized Ruby and exclaimed: "Jack, you son of a bitch!"[248] The crowd outside the headquarters burst into applause when they heard that Oswald had been shot.[249]An unconscious Oswald was taken by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital — the same hospital where Kennedy was pronounced dead two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07 p.m;[154] Dallas police chief Jesse Curry announced his death on a TV news broadcast.At 2:45 p.m. the same day, an autopsy was performed on Oswald in the Office of the County Medical Examiner.[247] Dallas County medical examiner Earl Rose announced the results of the gross autopsy: "The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male."[250] Rose's examination found that the bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.[250]A network television pool camera was broadcasting live to cover the transfer; millions of people watching on NBC witnessed the shooting as it happened and on other networks within minutes afterward.[251] In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the Dallas Times Herald was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his image of the murder of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder by Jack Ruby.[252]Ruby later said he had been distraught over Kennedy's death and that his motive for killing Oswald was "saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial".[253] Others have hypothesized that Ruby was part of a conspiracy. G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: "The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever."[254]Miller Funeral Home had great difficulty finding a cemetery willing to accept Oswald's remains; Rose Hill Cemetery in Fort Worth eventually agreed. A Lutheran reverend reluctantly agreed to officiate but then failed to appear. Reverend Louis Saunders of the Fort Worth Council of Churches volunteered, saying that "someone had to help this family". He performed a brief graveside service under heavy guard on November 25. Reporters covering the burial were asked to act as pallbearers.[255][256][257]Oswald's original tombstone, which gave his full name, birth date, and death date, was stolen; officials replaced it with a marker simply inscribed Oswald. His mother's body was buried beside his in 1981.[258]A claim that a look-alike Russian agent was buried in place of Oswald led to the body's exhumation on October 4, 1981.[259] Dental records confirmed it was Oswald. The remains were reburied in a new coffin because of water damage to the original.[260]In 2010, Miller Funeral Home employed a Los Angeles auction house to sell the original coffin to an anonymous bidder for $87,468.[259][260] The sale was halted after Oswald's brother Robert (1934–2017)[261] sued to reclaim the coffin.[259][260] In 2015, a district judge in Tarrant County, Texas ruled that the funeral home intentionally concealed the existence of the coffin from Robert Oswald, who had originally purchased it and believed that it had been discarded after the exhumation,[259][260] and ordered it returned to Robert Oswald along with damages equal to the sale price.[259][260] Robert Oswald's attorney stated that the coffin would likely be destroyed "as soon as possible".[259][260]
<h2>Official investigations</h2>
President Lyndon B. Johnson issued an executive order that created the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, and the Warren Report could not ascribe any one motive or group of motives to Oswald's actions:The proceedings of the commission were closed, though not secret. Approximately three percent of its files have yet to be released to the public, which has continued to provoke speculation among researchers.[n 12]In 1968, the Ramsey Clark Panel examined various photographs, X-ray films, documents, and other evidence. It concluded that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him: one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone, and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its right side.[263]In 1979, after a review of the evidence and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) largely concurred with the Warren Commission and was preparing to issue a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy.[264] However, late in the Committee's proceedings a dictabelt recording was introduced, purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots. After an analysis by the firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman appeared to indicate more than three gunshots, the HSCA revised its findings to assert a "high probability that two gunmen fired" at Kennedy and that Kennedy "was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy". Although the Committee was "unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy", it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved.[265] Four of the twelve members of the HSCA dissented from this conclusion.[264]The acoustical evidence has since been discredited.[266][267][268][269][270][271] Officer H.B. McLain, from whose motorcycle radio the HSCA acoustic experts said the Dictabelt evidence came,[272][273] has repeatedly stated that he was not yet in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination.[274] McLain asked the Committee, "'If it was my radio on my motorcycle, why did it not record the revving up at high speed plus my siren when we immediately took off for Parkland Hospital?'"[275]In 1982, a panel of twelve scientists appointed by the National Academy of Sciences, including Nobel laureates Norman Ramsey and Luis Alvarez, unanimously concluded that the acoustic evidence submitted to the HSCA was "seriously flawed", was recorded after the shots, and did not indicate additional gunshots.[276] Their conclusions were published in the journal Science.[277]In a 2001 article in the journal Science & Justice, D.B. Thomas wrote that the NAS investigation was itself flawed. He concluded with a 96.3 percent certainty that at least two gunmen fired at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.[278] In 2005, Thomas's conclusions were rebutted in the same journal. Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.[279] In 2010, D.B. Thomas challenged the 2005 Science & Justice article and restated his conclusion that there were at least two gunmen.[280]
<h2>Backyard photos</h2>
Photos of Oswald holding the rifle that was later determined to be the murder weapon are an important piece of evidence linking Oswald to the crime. The photos were uncovered with other possessions belonging to Oswald in the garage of Ruth Paine in Irving, Texas, on November 24, 1963.[281] Marina Oswald told the Warren Commission that around March 31, 1963, she had taken pictures of Oswald as he posed with a Carcano rifle, a holstered pistol, and two Marxist newspapers — The Militant and The Worker.[282]Oswald had sent one of the photos to The Militant's New York office with an accompanying letter stating he was "prepared for anything": according to Sylvia Weinstein, who handled the newspaper's subscriptions at the time, Oswald was seen as a "kookie" and politically "dumb and totally naive", as he apparently did not know that The Militant, published by the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party, and The Worker, published by the pro-Soviet Communist Party USA, were rival publications and ideologically opposed to each other.[283]The pictures were shown to Oswald after his arrest, but he insisted that they were forgeries.[284]In 1964, Marina testified before the Warren Commission that she had photographed Oswald, at his request using his camera — [285] These photos were labelled CE 133-A and CE 133-B. CE 133-A shows the rifle in Oswald's left hand and newspapers in front of his chest in the other, while the rifle is held with the right hand in CE 133-B. The Carcano in the images had markings matching those on the rifle found in the Book Depository after the assassination. Oswald's mother testified that on the day after the assassination she and Marina destroyed another photograph with Oswald holding the rifle with both hands over his head, with "To my daughter June" written on it.[286]When shown one of the photos during his interrogation by Dallas police, Oswald stated that it was a fake. According to Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz:The HSCA obtained another first-generation print (from CE 133-A) on April 1, 1977, from the widow of George de Mohrenschildt. The words "Hunter of fascists — ha ha ha!" written in block Russian were on the back. Also in English were added in script: "To my friend George, firstnameplaceholder Oswald, 5/IV/63 [April 5, 1963]."[287] Handwriting experts for the HSCA concluded the English inscription and signature were by Oswald. After two original photos, one negative and one first-generation copy had been found, the Senate Intelligence Committee located (in 1976) a third backyard photo (CE 133-C) showing Oswald with newspapers held away from his body in his right hand.These photos, widely recognized as some of the most significant evidence against Oswald, have been subjected to rigorous analysis.[288] Photographic experts consulted by the HSCA concluded they were genuine,[289] answering twenty-one points raised by critics.[290] Marina Oswald has always maintained she took the photos herself, and the 1963 de Mohrenschildt print bearing Oswald's signature clearly indicate they existed before the assassination. Nonetheless, some continue to contest their authenticity.[291] In 2009, after digitally analyzing the photograph of Oswald holding the rifle and paper, computer scientist Hany Farid concluded[292] that the photo "almost certainly was not altered".[293]
<h2>Other investigations and dissenting theories</h2>
Some critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, such as that Oswald conspired with others, or was not involved at all and was framed. A Gallup Poll taken in mid-November 2013, showed 61% believed that Kennedy was killed as a result of conspiracy, and only 30% thought Oswald acted alone.[294]Oswald was never prosecuted because he was murdered two days after the assassination. In March 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, David Ferrie, and others. Garrison believed that the men were part of an arms smuggling ring supplying weapons to the anti-Castro Cubans in a conspiracy with elements of the CIA to kill Kennedy.[295] The trial of Clay Shaw began in January 1969 in Orleans Parish Criminal Court. The jury acquitted Shaw.Several films have fictionalized a trial of Oswald, depicting what may have happened had Ruby not killed Oswald. The Trial of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (1964); The Trial of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (1977); and On Trial: firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (1986) have imagined such a trial. In 1988, a 21-hour unscripted mock trial was held on television, argued by lawyers before a  judge,[296] with unscripted testimony from surviving witnesses to the events surrounding the assassination; the jury returned a verdict of guilty. In 1992 the American Bar Association conducted two mock Oswald trials. The first trial ended in a hung jury. In the second trial the jury acquitted Oswald.

Charles "firstnameplaceholder" secondnameplaceholder (/ˌluːtʃiˈɑːnoʊ/,[1] Italian: [luˈtʃaːno]; born Salvatore Lucania[2] [salvaˈtoːre lukaˈniːa];[3] November 24, 1897 – January 26, 1962) was an Italian-born gangster who operated mainly in the United States. secondnameplaceholder started his criminal career in the Five Points gang and was instrumental in the development of the National Crime Syndicate. secondnameplaceholder is considered the father of modern organized crime in the United States for the establishment of The Commission in 1931, after he abolished the boss of bosses title held by Salvatore Maranzano following the Castellammarese War. He was also the first official boss of the modern Genovese crime family.In 1936, secondnameplaceholder was tried and convicted for compulsory prostitution and running a prostitution racket after years of investigation by District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey. He was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in prison, but during World War II an agreement was struck with the Department of the Navy through his associate Meyer Lansky to provide naval intelligence. In 1946, for his alleged wartime cooperation, his sentence was commuted on the condition that he be deported to Italy. secondnameplaceholder died in Italy on January 26, 1962, and his body was permitted to be transported back to the United States for burial.
<h2>Early life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born Salvatore Lucania on November 24, 1897, in Lercara Friddi, Sicily, Italy.[4][5] secondnameplaceholder's parents, Antonio Lucania and Rosalia Capporelli, had four other children: Bartolomeo (born 1890), Giuseppe (born 1898), Filippa (born 1901), and Concetta. secondnameplaceholder's father worked in a sulfur mine in Sicily.[6]His father was very ambitious and persistent in eventually moving to America. In The Last Testament of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: The Mafia Story in His Own Words, a purported semi-autobiography that was published after secondnameplaceholder's death, secondnameplaceholder described how his father always had a new Palermo-based steamship company calendar each year and would save money for the boat trip by keeping a jar under his bed. He also mentions in the book that his father was too proud to ask for money, so instead his mother was given money in secret by secondnameplaceholder's cousin, named Rotolo, who also lived in Lercara Friddi.Although the book has largely been regarded as accurate, there are numerous problems that point to the possibility that it is, in fact, fraudulent.[7] The book was based on conversations that secondnameplaceholder supposedly had with Hollywood producer Martin Gosch in the years before secondnameplaceholder's death. As The New York Times reported shortly before the book's publication, the book quotes secondnameplaceholder talking about events that occurred years after his death, repeats errors from previously published books on the Mafia, and describes secondnameplaceholder's participation in meetings that occurred when he was in jail.[7]In April 1906, when secondnameplaceholder was eight years old, the family emigrated from Sicily to the United States.[8] They settled in New York City in the borough of Manhattan on its Lower East Side, a popular destination for Italian immigrants.[9] At age 14, secondnameplaceholder dropped out of school and started a job delivering hats, earning $7 per week. However, after winning $244 in a dice game, secondnameplaceholder quit his job and began earning money on the street.[6] That same year, secondnameplaceholder's parents sent him to the Brooklyn Truant School.[10]As a teenager, secondnameplaceholder started his own gang and was a member of the old Five Points Gang. Unlike other street gangs, whose business was petty crime, secondnameplaceholder offered protection to Jewish youngsters from Italian and Irish gangs for 10 cents per week. He was also learning the pimping trade in the years around World War I. secondnameplaceholder also met Meyer Lansky as teenagers when secondnameplaceholder attempted to extort Lansky for protection money on his walk home from school. secondnameplaceholder respected the younger boy's defiant responses to his threats, and the two formed a lasting partnership.[11]It is not clear how secondnameplaceholder earned the nickname "firstnameplaceholder". It may have come from surviving a severe beating and throat slashing by three men in 1929 as the result of his refusal to work for another mob boss.[8] The nickname may also be attributed to his gambling luck, or to a simple mispronunciation of his last name.[12] From 1916 to 1936, secondnameplaceholder was arrested 25 times on charges including assault, illegal gambling, blackmail and robbery but spent no time in prison.[13] It is also not clear how his surname came to be rendered "secondnameplaceholder." This too may have been the result of persistent misspellings by newspapers.
<h2>Prohibition and the early 1920s</h2>
On January 17, 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution took effect and Prohibition lasted until the amendment was repealed in 1933. The amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. Demand for alcohol naturally continued, and the resulting black market for alcoholic beverages provided criminals with an additional source of income.By 1920, secondnameplaceholder had met many future Mafia leaders, including Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, his longtime friend and future business partner through the Five Points Gang. That same year, Lower Manhattan gang boss Joe Masseria recruited secondnameplaceholder as one of his gunmen.[14] Around that same time, secondnameplaceholder and his close associates started working for gambler Arnold "The Brain" Rothstein, who immediately saw the potential windfall from Prohibition and educated secondnameplaceholder on running bootleg alcohol as a business.[15] secondnameplaceholder, Costello, and Genovese started their own bootlegging operation with financing from Rothstein.[15]Rothstein served as a mentor for secondnameplaceholder; among other things, Rothstein taught him how to move in high society. In 1923, secondnameplaceholder was caught in a sting selling heroin to undercover agents. Although he saw no jail time, being outed as a drug peddler damaged his reputation among his high-class associates and customers. To salvage his reputation, secondnameplaceholder bought 200 expensive seats to the Jack Dempsey–Luis Firpo boxing match in the Bronx and distributed them to top gangsters and politicians. Rothstein then took secondnameplaceholder on a shopping trip to Wanamaker's Department Store in Manhattan to buy expensive clothes for the fight. The strategy worked, and secondnameplaceholder's reputation was saved.[16]By 1925, secondnameplaceholder was grossing over $12 million per year, and made a personal income of about $4 million per year from running an illegal gambling and bootlegging operations in New York that also extended into Philadelphia.[17]
<h2>Rise to power and the late 1920s</h2>
secondnameplaceholder soon became a top aide in Masseria's criminal organization. In contrast to Rothstein, Masseria was uneducated, with poor manners and limited managerial skills. By the late 1920s, Masseria's main rival was boss Salvatore Maranzano, who had come from Sicily to run the Castellammarese clan. After one of Masseria's lieutenants Gaetano Reina switched sides to Maranzano, Masseria ordered secondnameplaceholder to arrange Reina's murder.[18] After Reina was murdered on February 26, 1930, the rivalry between Masseria and Maranzano escalated into the bloody Castellammarese War.Masseria and Maranzano were so-called "Mustache Petes": older, traditional Mafia bosses who had started their criminal careers in Italy. They believed in upholding the supposed "Old World Mafia" principles of "honor," "tradition," "respect," and "dignity." These bosses refused to work with non-Italians, and were skeptical of working with non-Sicilians. Some of the most conservative bosses worked with only those men with roots in their own Sicilian village. secondnameplaceholder, in contrast, was willing to work with not only Italians, but also Jewish and Irish gangsters, as long as there was money to be made. secondnameplaceholder was shocked to hear traditional Sicilian mafiosi lecture him about his dealings with close friend Costello, whom they called "the dirty Calabrian".[19]secondnameplaceholder soon began cultivating ties with other younger mobsters who had been born in Italy but began their criminal careers in the United States. Known as the Young Turks, they chafed at their bosses' conservatism. secondnameplaceholder wanted to use lessons he learned from Rothstein to turn their gang activities into criminal empires.[20] As the war progressed, this group came to include future mob leaders such as Costello, Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis, Joe Bonanno, Carlo Gambino, Joe Profaci, Tommy Gagliano, and Tommy Lucchese. The Young Turks believed that their bosses' greed and conservatism were keeping them poor while the Irish and Jewish gangs got rich. secondnameplaceholder's vision was to form a national crime syndicate in which the Italian, Jewish, and Irish gangs could pool their resources and turn organized crime into a lucrative business for all—an organization he founded after a conference was hosted in Atlantic City by secondnameplaceholder, Johnny Torrio, Lansky and Costello in May 1929.[21][22][23]In October 1929, secondnameplaceholder was forced into a limousine at gunpoint by three men, beaten and stabbed, and strung up by his hands from a beam in a warehouse in Staten Island.[24] He survived the ordeal, but was forever marked with a scar and droopy eye.[25] The identity of his abductors was never established. When picked up by the police after the beating, secondnameplaceholder said that he had no idea who did it. However, in 1953, secondnameplaceholder told an interviewer that it was the police who kidnapped and beat him in an attempt to find Jack "Legs" Diamond.[26] Another story was that Maranzano ordered the attack.[27]In early 1931, secondnameplaceholder decided to eliminate Masseria. The war had been going poorly for Masseria, and secondnameplaceholder saw an opportunity to switch allegiance. In a secret deal with Maranzano, secondnameplaceholder agreed to engineer Masseria's death in return for receiving Masseria's rackets and becoming Maranzano's second-in-command.[25] Joe Adonis had joined the Masseria faction and when Masseria heard about secondnameplaceholder's betrayal, he approached Adonis about killing secondnameplaceholder. However, Adonis instead warned secondnameplaceholder about the murder plot.[28] On April 15, 1931, Masseria was killed at Nuova Villa Tammaro, a Coney Island restaurant in Brooklyn. While they played cards, secondnameplaceholder allegedly excused himself to go to the bathroom, at which point gunmen, reportedly Anastasia, Genovese, Adonis, and Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel, entered the restaurant.[29] Ciro "The Artichoke King" Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver's seat by Siegel.[30][31] With Maranzano's blessing, secondnameplaceholder took over Masseria's gang and became Maranzano's lieutenant, ending the Castellammarese War.[25]With Masseria gone, Maranzano reorganized the Italian American gangs in New York City into Five Families headed by secondnameplaceholder, Profaci, Gagliano, Vincent Mangano and himself. Maranzano called a meeting of crime bosses in Wappingers Falls, New York, where he declared himself capo di tutti capi ("boss of all bosses").[25] Maranzano also whittled down the rival families' rackets in favor of his own. secondnameplaceholder appeared to accept these changes, but was merely biding his time before removing Maranzano.[19] Although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, secondnameplaceholder had come to believe that Maranzano was even more greedy and hidebound than Masseria had been.[25]By September 1931, Maranzano realized secondnameplaceholder was a threat, and hired Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll, an Irish gangster, to kill him.[25] However, Lucchese alerted secondnameplaceholder that he was marked for death.[25] On September 10, Maranzano ordered secondnameplaceholder, Genovese and Costello to come to his office at the 230 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Convinced that Maranzano planned to murder them, secondnameplaceholder decided to act first.[32] He sent to Maranzano's office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano's people. They had been secured with the aid of Lansky and Siegel.[33] Disguised as government agents, two of the gangsters disarmed Maranzano's bodyguards. The other two, aided by Lucchese who was there to point Maranzano out, stabbed the boss multiple times before shooting him.[23][34] This assassination was the first of what would later be fabled as the "Night of the Sicilian Vespers."[23]Several days later, on September 13, the corpses of two other Maranzano allies, Samuel Monaco and Louis Russo, were retrieved from Newark Bay, showing evidence of torture. Meanwhile, Joseph Siragusa, leader of the Pittsburgh crime family, was shot to death in his home. The October 15 disappearance of Joe Ardizonne, head of the Los Angeles family, would later be regarded as part of this alleged plan to quickly eliminate the old-world Sicilian bosses.[33] However, the idea of an organized mass purge, directed by secondnameplaceholder, has been debunked as a myth.[35]
<h2>Reorganizing Cosa Nostra and The Commission</h2>
With the death of Maranzano, secondnameplaceholder became the dominant crime boss in the United States. He had reached the pinnacle of America's underworld, setting policies and directing activities along with the other Mafia bosses. His own crime family controlled lucrative criminal rackets in New York City such as illegal gambling, extortion, bookmaking, loansharking, and drug trafficking. secondnameplaceholder became very influential in labor union activities and controlled the Manhattan Waterfront, garbage hauling, construction, Garment District businesses, and trucking.Although there would have been few objections had secondnameplaceholder declared himself capo di tutti capi, he abolished the title, believing the position created trouble between the families and made himself a target for another ambitious challenger.[36] Instead, secondnameplaceholder chose to quietly maintain control through the Commission by forging unofficial alliances with other bosses. However, secondnameplaceholder did not discard all of Maranzano's changes. He believed that the ceremony of becoming a "made man" in a crime family was a Sicilian anachronism. However, Genovese persuaded secondnameplaceholder to keep the title, arguing that young people needed rituals to promote obedience to the family. secondnameplaceholder remained committed to omertà, the oath of silence, to protect the families from legal prosecution. In addition, he kept Maranzano's structure of five crime families in New York City.[25]secondnameplaceholder elevated his most trusted Italian associates to high-level positions in what was now the secondnameplaceholder crime family. Genovese became underboss and Costello consigliere. Adonis, Michael "Trigger Mike" Coppola, Anthony Strollo, Willie Moretti and Anthony Carfano all served as caporegimes. Because Lansky and Siegel were non-Italians, neither man could hold official positions within any Mafia family. However, Lansky was a top advisor to secondnameplaceholder and Siegel a trusted associate.Later in 1931, secondnameplaceholder called a meeting in Chicago with various bosses, where he proposed a Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime.[37] Designed to settle all disputes and decide which families controlled which territories, the Commission has been called secondnameplaceholder's greatest innovation.[25] secondnameplaceholder's goals with the Commission were to quietly maintain his own power over all the families, and to prevent future gang wars; the bosses approved the idea of the Commission.[38]The Commission was originally composed of representatives of the Five Families of New York City, the Buffalo crime family, and the Chicago Outfit; later, the crime families of Philadelphia and Detroit were added, with smaller families being formally represented by a Commission family.[38] The Commission also provided representation for Jewish criminal organizations in New York.[39]The group's first test came in 1935, when it ordered Dutch Schultz to drop his plans to murder Special Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey. secondnameplaceholder argued that a Dewey assassination would precipitate a massive law enforcement crackdown; the national crime syndicate had enacted a hard and fast rule stating that law enforcement and prosecutors were not to be harmed. An enraged Schultz said he would kill Dewey anyway and walked out of the meeting.[40] Murder, Inc leader Albert Anastasia approached secondnameplaceholder with information that Schultz had asked him to stake out Dewey's apartment building on Fifth Avenue. Upon hearing the news, the Commission held a discreet meeting to discuss the matter. After six hours of deliberations the Commission ordered Lepke Buchalter to eliminate Schultz.[41][42] On October 23, 1935, before he could kill Dewey, Schultz was shot in a tavern in Newark, New Jersey, and succumbed to his injuries the following day.[43][44]
<h2>Prosecution for pandering</h2>
During the early 1930s, secondnameplaceholder's crime family started taking over small scale prostitution operations in New York City. In June 1935, New York Governor Herbert H. Lehman appointed Dewey, a U.S. Attorney, as a special prosecutor to combat organized crime in the city.[45] Dewey's assistant district attorney Eunice Carter led an investigation into prostitution racketeering that connected secondnameplaceholder, the most powerful gangster in New York, to this prostitution network.Carter investigated the flow of money in the New York/New Jersey prostitution network, and she began to build a case of prostitution racketeering founded on evidence from interviews with prostitutes and wiretaps.[46] On February 2, 1936, Dewey authorized Carter to raid 200 brothels in Manhattan and Brooklyn, earning him nationwide recognition as a major "gangbuster". Carter took measures to prevent police corruption from impeding the raids: she assigned 160 police officers outside of the vice squad to conduct the raids, and the officers were instructed to wait on street corners until they received their orders, minutes before the raids were to begin.[47] Ten men and 100 women were arrested. However, unlike previous vice raids, the arrestees were not released, but taken to court, where a judge set bails of US$10,000, far beyond their means to pay.[48] Carter had built trust with a number of the arrested prostitutes and madams, some of whom reported being beaten and abused by the Mafia. She convinced many to testify rather than serve additional jail time.[46] By mid-March, several defendants had implicated secondnameplaceholder.[49] Three of these prostitutes implicated secondnameplaceholder as the ringleader, who made collections. secondnameplaceholder associate David Betillo was in charge of the prostitution ring in New York; any money that secondnameplaceholder received was from Betillo.In late March 1936, secondnameplaceholder received a tip that he was going to be arrested and fled to Hot Springs, Arkansas. Unfortunately for him, a New York detective in Hot Springs on a different assignment spotted secondnameplaceholder and notified Dewey.[50] On April 3, secondnameplaceholder was arrested in Hot Springs on a criminal warrant from New York. The next day in New York, Dewey indicted secondnameplaceholder and his accomplices on 60 counts of compulsory prostitution. secondnameplaceholder's lawyers in Arkansas then began a fierce legal battle against extradition. On April 6, Owney Madden, one time owner of the Cotton Club offered a $50,000 bribe to Arkansas Attorney General Carl E. Bailey to facilitate secondnameplaceholder's case. However, Bailey refused the bribe and immediately reported it.[51]On April 17, after all of secondnameplaceholder's legal options had been exhausted, Arkansas authorities handed him to three NYPD detectives for transport by train back to New York for trial.[52] When the train reached St. Louis, Missouri, the detectives and secondnameplaceholder changed trains. During this switchover, they were guarded by 20 local policemen to prevent a mob rescue attempt. The men arrived in New York on April 18, and secondnameplaceholder was sent to jail without bail.[53]On May 13, 1936, secondnameplaceholder's pandering trial began.[54] Dewey prosecuted the case that Carter built against secondnameplaceholder.[46] He accused secondnameplaceholder of being part of a massive prostitution ring known as "the Combination". During the trial, Dewey exposed secondnameplaceholder for lying on the witness stand through direct quizzing and records of telephone calls; secondnameplaceholder also had no explanation for why his federal income tax records claimed he made only $22,000 a year, while he was obviously a wealthy man.[25] Dewey ruthlessly pressed secondnameplaceholder on his long arrest record and his relationships with well-known gangsters such as Masseria, Terranova, and Buchalter.[55] On June 7, secondnameplaceholder was convicted on 62 counts of compulsory prostitution.[56] On June 18, he was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in state prison, along with Betillo and others.[57][58]In his book, Five Families, longtime New York Times organized-crime columnist Selwyn Raab wrote that a number of scholars have questioned whether secondnameplaceholder was directly involved in "the Combination." According to Raab, there was evidence that secondnameplaceholder profited from prostitution, and several members of his family ran a protection racket that ensnared many of New York City's madams and brothel keepers. However, Raab wrote, several Mafia and legal scholars believed that it would have been "out of character" for a crime boss of secondnameplaceholder's stature to be directly involved in a prostitution ring. Raab wrote that the evidence Dewey presented against secondnameplaceholder was "astonishingly thin," and argued that it would have been more appropriate to charge secondnameplaceholder with extortion. However, Raab believed that secondnameplaceholder's defense team erred in allowing him to take the stand in his own defense, opening the door for Dewey to attack his credibility on cross-examination.[25]At least two of secondnameplaceholder's contemporaries have denied that secondnameplaceholder was ever part of "the Combination". In her memoirs, New York society madam Polly Adler wrote that if secondnameplaceholder had been involved with "the Combination", she would have known about it. Bonanno, the last surviving contemporary of secondnameplaceholder's who wasn't in prison, also denied that secondnameplaceholder was directly involved in prostitution in his book, A Man of Honor. Bonanno believed that several of secondnameplaceholder's soldiers used secondnameplaceholder's name to intimidate brothel keepers into paying for protection and argued that Dewey built his case "not so much against secondnameplaceholder as against secondnameplaceholder's name."[25]However, key witnesses at secondnameplaceholder's trial testified that secondnameplaceholder was involved with prostitution racketeering, and frequently discussed the sex industry business, once describing it as "the same as the A & P stores are, a large syndicate...the same as chain stores", and ordering an underling to "[g]o ahead and crack the joint" when a brothel fell behind in its kickbacks. One witness testified that secondnameplaceholder, working out of his Waldorf-Astoria suite, personally hired him to collect from bookers and madams.[59]secondnameplaceholder continued to run his crime family from prison, relaying his orders through acting boss Genovese. However, in 1937, Genovese fled to Naples to avoid an impending murder indictment in New York.[60] secondnameplaceholder appointed his consigliere, Costello, as the new acting boss and the overseer of secondnameplaceholder's interests.secondnameplaceholder was first imprisoned at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York. However, later in 1936, authorities moved him to Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, a remote facility far away from New York City. At Clinton, Betillo prepared special dishes for secondnameplaceholder in a kitchen set aside by authorities.[25] secondnameplaceholder was assigned a job in the prison laundry.[61] secondnameplaceholder used his influence to help get the materials to build a church at the prison, which became famous for being one of the only freestanding churches in the New York State correctional system and also for the fact that on the church's altar are two of the original doors from the Victoria, the ship of Ferdinand Magellan.[36]secondnameplaceholder's legal appeals continued until October 10, 1938, when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review his case.[62] At this point, secondnameplaceholder stepped down as family boss and Costello formally replaced him.
<h2>World War II, freedom, and deportation</h2>
During World War II, the US government struck a secret deal with the imprisoned secondnameplaceholder. In 1942, the Office of Naval Intelligence was concerned about German and Italian agents entering the US through the New York waterfront. They also worried about sabotage in these facilities. Knowing that the Mafia controlled the waterfront, the US Navy contacted Lansky about a deal with secondnameplaceholder. To facilitate negotiations, secondnameplaceholder was transferred to Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Comstock, New York, which was much closer to New York City.[63]The Navy, the State of New York and secondnameplaceholder reached a deal: in exchange for a commutation of his sentence, secondnameplaceholder promised the complete assistance of his organization in providing intelligence to the Navy. Anastasia, a secondnameplaceholder ally who controlled the docks, allegedly promised no dockworker strikes during war. In preparation for the 1943 allied invasion of Sicily, secondnameplaceholder allegedly provided the US military with Sicilian Mafia contacts. This collaboration between the Navy and the Mafia became known as Operation Underworld.[61]The value of secondnameplaceholder's contribution to the war effort is highly debated. In 1947, the naval officer in charge of Operation Underworld discounted the value of his wartime aid.[64] A 1954 report ordered by now-Governor Dewey stated that secondnameplaceholder provided many valuable services to Naval Intelligence.[65] The enemy threat to the docks, secondnameplaceholder allegedly said, was manufactured by the sinking of the SS Normandie in New York harbor, supposedly directed by Anastasia's brother, Anthony Anastasio.[66][67] However, the official investigation of the ship sinking found no evidence of sabotage.[68]On January 3, 1946, as a presumed reward for his alleged wartime cooperation, Dewey reluctantly commuted secondnameplaceholder's pandering sentence on condition that he did not resist deportation to Italy.[69] secondnameplaceholder accepted the deal, although he still maintained that he was a US citizen and not subject to deportation. On February 2, 1946, two federal immigration agents transported secondnameplaceholder from Sing Sing prison to Ellis Island in New York Harbor for deportation proceedings.[70] On February 9, the night before his departure, secondnameplaceholder shared a spaghetti dinner on his freighter with Anastasia and five other guests.[71]On February 10, secondnameplaceholder's ship sailed from Brooklyn Harbor for Italy.[71] On February 28, after a 17-day voyage, secondnameplaceholder's ship arrived in Naples. On arrival, secondnameplaceholder told reporters he would probably reside in Sicily.[72]
<h2>The Havana Conference</h2>
In October 1946, secondnameplaceholder secretly moved to Havana, Cuba. secondnameplaceholder first took a freighter from Naples to Caracas, Venezuela, then flew to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He then flew to Mexico City and doubled back to Caracas, where he took a private plane to Camagüey, Cuba, finally arriving on October 29. secondnameplaceholder was then driven to Havana, where he moved into an estate in the Miramar section of the city.[73] His objective was to be closer to the US so that he could resume control over American Mafia operations and eventually return home.[74] Lansky was already established as a major investor in Cuban gambling and hotel projects.In 1946, Lansky called a meeting of the heads of the major crime families in Havana that December, dubbed the Havana Conference. The ostensible reason was to see singer Frank Sinatra perform. However, the real reason was to discuss mob business with secondnameplaceholder in attendance. The three topics under discussion were: the heroin trade, Cuban gambling, and what to do about Siegel and his floundering Flamingo Hotel project in Las Vegas. The Conference took place at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba and lasted a little more than a week.On December 20, during the conference, secondnameplaceholder had a private meeting with Genovese in secondnameplaceholder's hotel suite. The year before, Genovese had been returned from Italy to New York to face trial on his 1934 murder charge.[75] However, in June 1946, the charges were dismissed and Genovese was free to return to mob business.[76] Unlike Costello, secondnameplaceholder had never trusted Genovese. In the meeting, Genovese tried to convince secondnameplaceholder to become a titular "boss of bosses" and let Genovese run everything. secondnameplaceholder calmly rejected Genovese's suggestion:Soon after the Conference began, the US government learned that secondnameplaceholder was in Cuba. secondnameplaceholder had been publicly fraternizing with Sinatra as well as visiting numerous nightclubs, so his presence was no secret in Havana.[78] The US started putting pressure on the Cuban government to expel him. On February 21, 1947, U.S. Narcotics Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger notified the Cubans that the US would block all shipment of narcotic prescription drugs while secondnameplaceholder was there.[20][79] Two days later, the Cuban government announced that secondnameplaceholder was in custody and would be deported to Italy within 48 hours.[80] secondnameplaceholder was placed on a Turkish freighter that was sailing to Genoa.
<h2>Operating in Italy</h2>
After secondnameplaceholder's secret trip to Cuba, he spent the rest of his life in Italy under tight police surveillance. When he arrived in Genoa on April 11, 1947, Italian police arrested him and sent him to a jail in Palermo. On May 11, a regional commission in Palermo warned secondnameplaceholder to stay out of trouble and released him.[81]In early July 1949, police in Rome arrested secondnameplaceholder on suspicion of involvement in the shipping of narcotics to New York. On July 15, after a week in jail, police released secondnameplaceholder without filing any charges. The authorities also permanently banned him from visiting Rome.[82] On June 9, 1951, he was questioned by Naples police on suspicion of illegally bringing $57,000 in cash and a new American car into Italy. After 20 hours of questioning, police released secondnameplaceholder without any charges.[83]In 1952, the Italian government revoked secondnameplaceholder's passport after complaints from US and Canadian law enforcement officials.[84] On November 1, 1954, an Italian judicial commission in Naples applied strict limits on secondnameplaceholder for two years. He was required to report to the police every Sunday, to stay home every night, and not to leave Naples without police permission. The commission cited secondnameplaceholder's alleged involvement in the narcotics trade as the reason for these restrictions.[85]
<h2>American power struggle</h2>
By 1957, Genovese felt strong enough to move against secondnameplaceholder and his acting boss, Costello. He was aided in this move by Anastasia family underboss Carlo Gambino. On May 2, 1957, following Genovese's orders, Vincent "Chin" Gigante ambushed Costello in the lobby of his Central Park apartment building, The Majestic. Gigante called out, "This is for you, Frank," and as Costello turned, shot him in the head. After firing his weapon, Gigante quickly left, thinking he had killed Costello. However, the bullet had just grazed Costello's head and he was not seriously injured. Although Costello refused to cooperate with the police, Gigante was arrested for attempted murder. Gigante was acquitted at trial, thanking Costello in the courtroom after the verdict. Costello was allowed to retire after conceding control of what is called today the Genovese crime family to Genovese. secondnameplaceholder was powerless to stop it.[86]On October 25, 1957, Genovese and Gambino successfully arranged the murder of Anastasia, another secondnameplaceholder ally.[87] The following month, Genovese called a meeting of bosses in Apalachin, New York to approve his takeover of the secondnameplaceholder family and to establish his national power. Instead, the Apalachin Meeting turned into a fiasco when law enforcement raided the meeting. Over 65 high-ranking mobsters were arrested and the Mafia was subjected to publicity and numerous grand jury summonses.[88] The enraged mobsters blamed Genovese for the disaster, opening a window of opportunity for Genovese's opponents.secondnameplaceholder allegedly attended a meeting in a hotel in Palermo to discuss heroin trade as part of the French Connection. After their meeting, secondnameplaceholder allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal.[89] On April 4, 1959, Genovese was convicted in New York of conspiracy to violate federal narcotics laws.[90] Sent to prison for 15 years, Genovese tried to run his crime family from prison until his death in 1969.[91] Meanwhile, Gambino now became the most powerful man in the Cosa Nostra.
<h2>Death and legacy</h2>
On January 26, 1962, secondnameplaceholder died of a heart attack at Naples International Airport. He had gone to the airport to meet with American producer Martin Gosch about a film based on his life. To avoid antagonizing other Mafia members, secondnameplaceholder had previously refused to authorize a film, but reportedly relented after the death of his longtime lover, Igea Lissoni. After the meeting with Gosch, secondnameplaceholder had a heart attack and died. He was unaware that Italian drug agents had followed him to the airport in anticipation of arresting him on drug smuggling charges.[6]Three days later, 300 people attended a funeral service for secondnameplaceholder in Naples. His body was conveyed along the streets of Naples in a horse-drawn black hearse.[92] With the permission of the US government, secondnameplaceholder's relatives took his body back to New York for burial. He was buried in St. John's Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens. More than 2,000 mourners attended his funeral. Gambino, secondnameplaceholder's longtime friend, gave his eulogy.[93]In 1998, Time characterized secondnameplaceholder as the "criminal mastermind" among the top 20 most influential builders and titans of the 20th century.[94]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
In 1929, secondnameplaceholder met Gay Orlova, a featured dancer in one of Broadway's leading nightclubs, Hollywood.[95] They were inseparable until he went to prison, but were never married.[95] In early 1948, he met Igea Lissoni, a Milanese ballerina 20 years his junior, whom he later described as the love of his life. In the summer, Lissoni moved in with him. Although some reports said the couple married in 1949, others state that they only exchanged rings.[6][96] secondnameplaceholder and Lissoni lived together in secondnameplaceholder's house in Naples. He continued to have affairs with other women, resulting in many arguments with Lissoni during which he physically struck her. In 1959, Lissoni died of breast cancer.secondnameplaceholder never had children. He once provided his reasons for that: "I didn't want no son of mine to go through life as the son of secondnameplaceholder, the gangster. That's one thing I still hate Dewey for, making me a gangster in the eyes of the world."[97]

<h2>Early life and early criminal career</h2>
Born in Ixelles, Belgium, on 6 November 1956,[5] secondnameplaceholder was the eldest child of five of Victor and Jeanine, who were both teachers. He spent the first years of his life in the Belgian Congo. After the Congo Crisis, his parents had to return to Belgium.[6]secondnameplaceholder reported that he was repeatedly beaten by his parents. His parents divorced in 1971 and secondnameplaceholder left home. He then became a drifter and a male sex worker.[6] secondnameplaceholder married at age 20 and had two children. He admitted to beating his wife and cheating on her. They separated in the 1980s.[6] One of his mistresses was Michelle Martin, whom he later married and had three more children with.[6] secondnameplaceholder and Martin may have met when they were both in prison and married in 1989 and divorced in 2003.[citation needed]Although secondnameplaceholder had already been imprisoned in 1989 for committing similar crimes (the kidnapping and rape of young girls), he was released early:[7]On 14 December 1985, secondnameplaceholder abducted Axelle D. During her testimony, she told the police that secondnameplaceholder's accomplice Peteghem had told her that "he was part of a gang" led by two gang leaders, "an Italian and a crazy stupid one." Jean van Peteghem admitted to having taken part in the abduction. He said he had abducted Axelle D. with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and Michelle Martin. He had lived with secondnameplaceholder after being discharged from the military and having his marriage fail. Peteghem told police that his and secondnameplaceholder's first victims were two girls from Morlanwelz. These two victims were never located by police. On 7 June 1985 the first proven abduction by the two took place, the abduction of eleven-year-old Sylvie D. On 17 October 1985 the pair abducted Maria V., 19, from Peronnes-lez-Binche. Maria V. also identified a third man who took part in her abduction and appeared to be in his fifties. This man was never found by police. On 17 January 1986 Catherine B., aged 18, was abducted from Obaix in Hainaut Province. secondnameplaceholder had one or two accomplices in her abduction who were never found by police. Peteghem was stationed as army personnel in Germany during that time and could not have assisted secondnameplaceholder. On 18 December 1985, secondnameplaceholder abducted Élisabeth G., 15, in Pont-à-Celles. Peteghem told police that secondnameplaceholder filmed Élisabeth naked and took pictures of her. At the beginning of February 1987, Martin, secondnameplaceholder and Peteghem were arrested. This had to a large extent been the fault of Peteghem, who had given out a lot of information about himself in conversations with the girls, which had been enough for police to identify him. The three were eventually convicted on 26 April 1989. secondnameplaceholder received 13½ years. Peteghem received 6½ years and Martin received 5 years. secondnameplaceholder received a harsher sentence because he had also committed several robberies with Peteghem. secondnameplaceholder was thus additionally convicted for the brutal robbery of a 58-year-old woman. The robbery was also committed with accomplices. One of the accomplices in this robbery was also never found by police.[8]The early release of secondnameplaceholder was granted by Melchior Wathelet,[9] who was at that time the Belgian minister of justice; secondnameplaceholder's release was ordered against the advice of both the public prosecutor and the psychiatrist who had examined him in prison, who stated that secondnameplaceholder remained dangerous.[8]While in jail, secondnameplaceholder managed to convince a health professional that he was disabled due to mental illness. He thus was able to collect public assistance from the Belgium government of $1,200 a month. He furthermore convinced the professional that he needed sedatives for sleeping problems. secondnameplaceholder later went on to use those sedatives to sedate his victims.[10][11] He owned seven small houses, most of them vacant, and used three of them for the torture of the girls he kidnapped. Although he owned several houses, his state assistance stipend wasn't reduced. In his residence in firstnameplaceholderinelle, he constructed a concealed dungeon in the basement. secondnameplaceholder has been described by psychiatrists who examined him for trial as a psychopath.[12]
<h2>Crimes after release</h2>
On 24 June 1995, eight-year-old classmates Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo were kidnapped after going for a walk in Grâce-Hollogne, probably by secondnameplaceholder,[13] and brought to his house in firstnameplaceholderinelle. secondnameplaceholder kept them imprisoned in the dungeon he had created, repeatedly sexually abused them and produced pornographic videos of the abuse. Two months later, in the early hours of 23 August in Ostend, secondnameplaceholder and accomplice Michel Lelièvre kidnapped An firstnameplaceholderhal and Eefje Lambrecks, two teenage girls from Hasselt[14] who were on their way back to their holiday home in Westende following a night out in Blankenberge.[15] With Lejeune and Russo already in the dungeon, Lambrecks and firstnameplaceholderhal were kept in chains in a bedroom. In September, according to Martin, Lambrecks and firstnameplaceholderhal were drugged and brought to Jumet, where secondnameplaceholder and accomplice Bernard Weinstein killed them by burying them alive.[16]Around the time of Lambrecks's and firstnameplaceholderhal's deaths, Weinstein and a man named Philippe Divers stole a van and hid it in a hangar; after it was found there by the hangar's owner, it was taken away by the police. secondnameplaceholder and Weinstein suspected that Divers and his friend Pierre Rochow had betrayed them, and on the night of 4 November, wishing to interrogate them about the van, secondnameplaceholder and Weinstein lured Divers and Rochow into Weinstein's home in Jumet and drugged and sequestered them, before leaving to go to Rochow's house to search for clues about the van. There they found Rochow's girlfriend, Bénédicte Jadot, whom they took with them back to Jumet and questioned, before leaving again to pick up another person. While they were away, Jadot escaped and alerted a neighbour, who called the police.[17][18] With Weinstein wanted by police, secondnameplaceholder decided to kill him to prevent his capture. He kidnapped Weinstein and held him in the dungeon at his house in firstnameplaceholderinelle between 13 and 20 November. During this time, he let Lejeune and Russo roam freely around the house. After feeding him food laced with Rohypnol, secondnameplaceholder placed hose clamps around Weinstein's testicles until Weinstein told him where his money was hidden. secondnameplaceholder then  buried Weinstein alive on his (secondnameplaceholder's) property in Sars-la-Buissière.[19] On 6 December 1995, secondnameplaceholder, having been recognised by Rochow, was arrested for vehicle theft.[20][18]According to secondnameplaceholder and Martin, Lejeune and Russo were still alive in the house at the time of secondnameplaceholder's arrest in December 1995, and secondnameplaceholder had ordered Martin to leave new food and water for the girls in the dungeon each time they ran out. Martin neglected to feed them, later claiming she was too afraid to go into the dungeon.[21] Lejeune and Russo eventually starved to death. secondnameplaceholder initially stated that they were still alive when he returned home following his release from prison on 20 firstnameplaceholderh 1996; according to him, Lejeune died that day, and Russo followed suit four days later despite his efforts to save her; during his trial, he said they were already dead when he returned from prison.[22][23] An expert asserted that they would not have been able to survive the entire time secondnameplaceholder was in prison on the total amount of food and water they were said to have been given.[24] secondnameplaceholder buried Lejeune and Russo's bodies in the garden of the house he owned in Sars-la-Buissière, near to that of Weinstein.[25]On the morning of 28 May 1996, secondnameplaceholder and Lelièvre kidnapped 12-year-old Sabine Dardenne, who was cycling to school in Tournai.[26] In a book originally published under the title J'avais 12 ans, j'ai pris mon vélo et je suis partie à l'école[27] (and published in the United Kingdom under the title I Choose to Live), Dardenne described her time in captivity in secondnameplaceholder's firstnameplaceholderinelle home, where she spent most of the time imprisoned in the dungeon and was starved and repeatedly raped by secondnameplaceholder.[28] On 9 August, 1996, secondnameplaceholder and Lelièvre kidnapped 14-year-old Laëtitia Delhez as she was walking home from her local swimming pool in Bertrix.[29] An eyewitness observed secondnameplaceholder's van, described it and was able to identify part of the license plate.[30] On 13 August 1996 , secondnameplaceholder, Martin and Lelièvre were arrested.[31][32] An initial search of secondnameplaceholder's houses proved inconclusive, but two days later, secondnameplaceholder and Lelièvre both made confessions. That same day, secondnameplaceholder led the police to the basement dungeon inside which Dardenne and Delhez were imprisoned; the girls were subsequently rescued.[33] On 17 August 1996, secondnameplaceholder led police to his house in Sars-la-Buissière and, with his help, they were able to locate and exhume the bodies of Lejeune, Russo and Weinstein.[34] On 3 September, the remains of firstnameplaceholderhal and Lambrecks were located and exhumed in Jumet.[35] Hundreds of commercial adult pornographic videos, along with a large number of home-made sex films that secondnameplaceholder had made with Martin, were recovered from his properties.[36]
<h2>Errors during investigation</h2>
In 1995, secondnameplaceholder's mother wrote a letter to the authorities stating that she knew that secondnameplaceholder had kidnapped two girls and was keeping them at his house.[37]After Lejeune and Russo were kidnapped in June 1995, it took police 14 months to arrest secondnameplaceholder, although he had been a prime suspect from the start, having committed similar crimes before.[3] During the search for Lejeune and Russo, police visited secondnameplaceholder's house, where Lejeune and Russo were held, twice, on 13 and 19 December, 1995. However, no attempts were made to free them, even though the locksmith who accompanied police officer René Michaux[3] said that he had heard the screams of children coming from inside the house. The locksmith reportedly said, "I'm not leaving before we turn the place upside down. The screams are clearly coming from inside the house," to which Michaux replied, "Who is the police officer here? You or me?"[citation needed]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was arrested on 6 December 1995 on car theft charges and subsequently sentenced to three months in jail.[6] During those three months, Lejeune and Russo, undiscovered by police, died of starvation and dehydration in their dungeon cell, as the wife of secondnameplaceholder didn't feed them, despite being aware that they required her care to remain alive.[3]During the search of the houses of secondnameplaceholder, about a hundred video tapes were found.[38] They were never looked at. Some of them showed secondnameplaceholder constructing the dungeon in which Lejeune and Russo were held. Had police looked at them, they might have found the dungeon containing Lejeune and Russo.[3] The video tapes had been in the possession of the police since December 1995. They had been passed on to the prosecutors in the case, but not to the judges.[39] Furthermore, some of the video tapes were returned to secondnameplaceholder by police officer René Michaux without ever being looked at.[citation needed]Michel Bourlet, who was appointed lead investigator, said that some of the video tapes had disappeared and that he wanted to have them all recovered and reviewed.[38]The videos were reportedly stolen after they were returned to secondnameplaceholder.[38] In 1999 some of the tapes were finally reviewed. One of them showed secondnameplaceholder raping a young woman in Slovakia.[38] The videos could have made it possible to identify other victims and also to determine the severity of the torture that the victims had to endure during their ordeal.[38]Later during the trial, the lawyer of one of the victims, Laetitia Delhez, also expressed disappointment that the videos were not reviewed, because they could have proved that secondnameplaceholder wasn't acting alone.[38]On 23 April 1998,[20] secondnameplaceholder was allowed to view his case files. He was accompanied by two police officers. When one officer went on a break, secondnameplaceholder overpowered the other officer and was able to escape. He was captured a few hours later.[40] The Minister of Justice, Stefaan De Clerck, the Minister of the Interior, Johan Vande Lanotte, and the police chief resigned as a result. In 2000, secondnameplaceholder received a five-year sentence for threatening a police officer during his escape. In 2002, he received another five-year sentence for unrelated crimes.[6][36]Thousands of hairs were found in the cellar dungeon where Lejeune and Russo were held. However, those were not tested for DNA until 2001.[40]An inquiry began into the handling of the investigation by officer De Baets. This inquiry  monopolised resources; during the inquiry, it wasn't possible for De Baets to pass on information to the Parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the case; crucial time was lost.[41]There were accusations that language difficulties obscured the investigation. The testimony of Régina Louf was in Dutch; however, it was reviewed several times by the new investigators, who were primarily French-speaking; they had difficulties in understanding her, resulting in the meaning of her testimony being altered to make her sound less credible.[41]Several sources had said that Michel Nihoul and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder were planning a prostitution and human trafficking operation between Slovakia, the Czech Republic and western Europe. Several other pieces of evidence pointed to connections to Slovakia and the Czech Republic. This included a video tape of secondnameplaceholder raping a child in Slovakia that police failed to review after it was seized. The car theft and smuggling operation that secondnameplaceholder was involved in pointed to those two Eastern European countries. At the time of his arrest, secondnameplaceholder was in possession of 2,000 SKK in cash. Six Belgian investigators visited the Czech Republic and Slovakia in August 1996. It wasn't seen to be possible for them to prove that secondnameplaceholder had committed any crimes while there, and they returned to Belgium without any substantial evidence.[42]
<h2>Accusations of cover-up</h2>
Many Belgians came to believe that secondnameplaceholder was part of a paedophile network which included high-ranking members of the Belgian establishment and that the other people involved were never prosecuted.[40]In October 1996, judge Jean-firstnameplaceholder Connerotte was removed from the investigation, ostensibly due to concerns of his impartiality after he attended a fund-raising dinner for the victims' families.[43] Press reports claimed that, prior to his removal, Connerotte was on the verge of publicly disclosing the names of high level government officials who had been recognized on video-tapes.[44] Connerotte had said that the businessman Michel Nihoul was the brains behind the child kidnapping operation.[3] Investigators also believed that secondnameplaceholder and Nihoul were planning on a long-distance prostitution trafficking network involving cars and the import of girls from Slovakia.[45]The investigating police said in 1996, that secondnameplaceholder was part of a child-prostitution ring, that may also have been responsible for several other disappearances still unsolved. They also said that the gang around secondnameplaceholder offered $5000 per girl they received. Their criminal activities also involved car theft.[7] It was said that the criminal network around secondnameplaceholder was involved in car theft and smuggling. The car in which Lejeune and Russo were kidnapped was never found. The general prosecutor, Anne Thilly, decided to have the car theft and smuggling be investigated by different police authorities in different parts of the country. In this way it was nearly impossible to investigate the connection between the car theft, kidnapping and human trafficking.[45] According to blogger Elizabeth Vos, writing in Consortium News, secondnameplaceholder also said that Nihoul had proposed to traffic girls from Eastern countries.[46]Michel Lelièvre, the accomplice of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, said that the two girls, Lejeune and Russo, were kidnapped as an order by a third party. However, while under arrest, Lelièvre stopped cooperating with the authorities.[3] He told police that he had been threatened and couldn't risk saying any more.[45]The father of Mélissa Russo, Gino Russo, said during the White firstnameplaceholderh that the removal of judge Connerotte was like "spitting on the grave of Julie and Mélissa." Russo subsequently said that after Connerotte was removed there was no progress in the investigation.[3]secondnameplaceholder owned ten houses. He was in total worth 6 million Belgian francs (US$130,000).[41] While he had all of this wealth in property he also received public assistance of $1,200 a month. It isn't clear how secondnameplaceholder was able to acquire the ten properties. Documents were released by WikiLeaks that show that large sums of money in different currencies arrived in Michelle Martin's bank account, linked in time to the disappearances of the abducted girls.[7] According to Elizabeth Vos, the money was also transferred in foreign currencies from Morocco and Saudi Arabia.[46] Both the transfers and the value of the six properties that secondnameplaceholder owned suggested to investigators that he was financed by a larger pedophile and prostitution ring.[41] The Flemish newspaper Nieuwsblad reported that he had committed health-insurance fund fraud, theft, insurance fraud and investments on the stock market and that these had contributed to his wealth.[47]Other outlets suggested that he was able to acquire his wealth through criminal activity such as drug-trafficking and insurance fraud.[6] Additional sources said that he made a lot of money with car theft and pimping.[37]Paul firstnameplaceholderhal, the father of the murdered An firstnameplaceholderhal, accused the police and the judicial system of a cover-up in 2001. He was angry that still in 2001 the trial hadn't started even though secondnameplaceholder had been under arrest for several years. firstnameplaceholderhal said: "It feels like they don't want to find the truth. It is not a good feeling and not only I think this."[40]Carine Russo and her husband Gino Russo were not permitted to identify their daughter and look at her body. They were told by authorities that secondnameplaceholder had identified her and that that was enough.[3] The autopsy of Mélissa showed that she had been raped repeatedly over a prolonged period of time. No DNA evidence was taken from the body to conclusively make sure that only secondnameplaceholder had raped her. secondnameplaceholder always denied raping Mélissa and Julie.[3]Eventually several families of victims boycotted the official trial, stating that it was a circus and there had been no progress in the case since the removal of judge Connerotte.[48]There were countless hairs found in the dungeon where the two girls were held. Judge Langlois refused to have them tested for DNA evidence even though the leading police investigator, Michel Bourlet, had begged him to have them analyzed in order to know whether more people beside secondnameplaceholder were involved.[3] The general prosecutor of the case, Anne Thily, said that she didn't believe there was anyone else involved and thus didn't have the samples analyzed.[3] Thily told investigative journalist Olenka Frenkiel, "In any case the hairs have all now been analysed—all 5,000. And the results of this analysis? Nothing. No evidence of any relevance in the secondnameplaceholder affair. Which proves, of course, that Langlois was right all along." According to Frenkiel, this wasn't true. Sources central to the investigation confirmed that, as  of 2002, the hairs had still not been analysed. Frenkiel accused senior prosecutor Thily of lying brazenly.[3] Frenkiel continued to question Thily and asked her how she would want to prove that secondnameplaceholder raped the girls, as he was denying it and there was no DNA evidence. Thily then replied that there were DNA tests, but that the results came back inconclusive as the bodies were too decomposed at the time the samples were taken.[3] secondnameplaceholder's lawyer, Xavier Magnee, said during the trial proceedings "I speak not only as a lawyer, but also as a citizen and father. He was not the only devil. Out of the 6000 hair samples that were found in the basement cellar where some of the victims were held, 25 "unknown" DNA profiles were discovered. There were people in that cellar that are not now accused." The prosecution never attempted to match those DNA profiles to people implicated in the case.[49]Magnee also asserted that the prosecutors didn't follow up on evidence pointing to a cult called "Abrasax", which allegedly performed human sacrifices.[49] In a wooden house owned by Bernard Weinstein , a letter was found from the occult sect "Abrasax", in which a gift for Dominique Kindermans, the high priestress,[50] was mentioned, consisting of 17 girls between the age of 2 and 20 for anal, oral and vaginal sex. It was signed by priest "Anubis".[citation needed] This priest was later identified as Francis De Smedt.[citation needed] Later investigations showed that four policemen in Charleroi were also members of the sect; one was even the treasurer.[51] The headquarters of Institut Abrasax in Rue Emile Vandervelde 223 Forchies La firstnameplaceholderhe was raided in 1996 by 150 officers. Video of the raid showed police taking away bags of papers, video cassettes and a refrigerator. They also took away black magic ritual implements and human skulls.[50]Several police officers who had worked on the case were subsequently removed from the case in 1997. They were reportedly removed because they had manipulated evidence surrounding the testimony of Régina Louf. The involved officers always denied that accusation. This included officer Rudi Hoskens, who believed that the testimony of witness X1, Régina Louf, was true because her testimony matched an unsolved murder case that she could have had no knowledge of, had she not witnessed it. What she described was the murder of then 15-year-old Christine van Hees. She said that the girl was tortured to death by the group and that Nihoul took part in the torture. She said secondnameplaceholder watched. Christine van Hees's body was found in 1984.[3] The officer leading the investigation, De Baets, stated that they followed up on all testimonies the X witnesses had given, in order to determine whether what they said was possible or not, and that they came to the conclusion that it was possible that the things had occurred as the witnesses described them. As this took up a lot of resources and time of the police force, an inquiry was initiated into the handling of the case, which then again took up as many resources as the investigation of De Baets itself. It was said that:"The suspicion grew that De Baets and others formed part of a sect bent on destabilising the kingdom." De Baets and large parts of his team were removed from the investigation and sent home on indefinite leave.[41] Not only was De Baets dropped from the investigation, but he was also charged in 1997 with concealing the fact that Louf had wrongly identified the photograph of one of the victims. However, on the videotapes of her interrogation, it is visible that it was very hard for her to stand looking at the photographs and that her right answer had been in the files all along. In 1999, De Baets was exonerated from the charges.[41] Additionally, two journalists from Le Soir, who were judged to have defamed him and four colleagues, were ordered to pay the gendarmes 2.2 million Belgian francs ($55,000), plus costs.[41] Even though De Baets had been exonerated, he and his colleagues remained on leave.[41]An officer searched secondnameplaceholder's house while Lejeune and Russo were likely still alive on 13 and 19 December 1995. Although the locksmith who inspected the house with him suggested they should search the whole house to find out where children's screams were coming from, Michaux left after not having searched the house thoroughly.[38] Not only did Michaux fail to rescue Lejeune and Russo, he also failed to ever look at video tapes that were confiscated from secondnameplaceholder's house. Those video tapes showed him constructing the dungeon, which would have led them to the place where Lejeune and Russo had been kept. Some of the videos also included tapes of secondnameplaceholder raping women. Many of the tapes were returned to secondnameplaceholder without ever being looked at by law enforcement.[38]Even though Michaux committed grave failures in his duty as a police officer in what was one of the most important criminal cases in the history of Belgium, he was never removed or put on leave like other officers had been. According to Vos, he was subsequently promoted to the position of police commissioner.[46]At least seven members of law enforcement were arrested on suspicion of having ties to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. One of them was Georges Zico, a police detective believed to be an associate of secondnameplaceholder.[52] According to prosecutor Michel Bourlet, Zico was charged with truck theft, document forgery and insurance fraud.[52]The judge presiding over the secondnameplaceholder case, Judge Jean-Claude Van Espen, had a close relationship with Michel Nihoul. A journalist revealed that, while he was a lawyer, Van Espen had represented the wife of Nihoul. Van Espen's sister was the godmother of Nihoul's child. However, even though his close friend Michel Nihoul was involved in the case, Van Espen never resigned. He was also not removed from the case for a very long time, even though judge Conerotte had been removed simply for attending a fundraising dinner.[3] Van Espen was furthermore the judge presiding over the murder case of Christine van Hees from 1984. He only resigned from the secondnameplaceholder case in 1998, when Nihoul was accused of being involved in the murder and Van Espen's close ties to Nihoul were revealed.[3]Connerotte testified in the secondnameplaceholder case on 4 firstnameplaceholderh 2004. He broke down in the witness box stating that there had been high-level murder plots to stop his investigation into the child-sex mafia. He stated that he had to drive in bullet-proof cars and had armed guards around him at all times because shadowy figures from the crime world were threatening him. The police had informed him that murder contracts had been taken out against the prosecutors in the case. He alleged that organised crime methods were used to discredit his work and make sure that the investigation would end in a judicial failure.[48]Connerotte criticised authorities for not rescuing Lejeune and Russo, even though secondnameplaceholder had been a prime suspect for one year before they were found dead. Connerotte also said that he had received files describing a child-sex network. It described seizure of children and foreign trafficking. The sum of 150,000 francs was mentioned as the price for a girl.[48] Connerotte also said that he was doubtful of the official explanation on how Lejeune and Russo died. It was said that they starved to death in the dungeon. An adult can last about three days without water and maximum 60 days without food. If they received nothing to drink and eat they should have been dead very soon after secondnameplaceholder was imprisoned. However, Michelle Martin insisted that they were still alive when he returned.[48] Connerotte had even written to King Albert II of Belgium in 1996, stating that his investigations into crime networks were being blocked because suspects "received serious protection". The judge said that the "dysfunctional judiciary" was breaking down as mafia groups took secret control of the "key institutions of the country".[48]A letter from Connerotte addressed to King Albert II in 1996 stated: "This institution seems to acquire its authority and supremacy over sectors of the justice system by relying on a complex and secret modus operandi, that of the appropriation of certain key circuits of our institutions created and regulated by the Law. It is a matter essentially of political, financial, police, and media circuits. This mafia-style criminal phenomenon is evidently not peculiar to Belgium, but it involves particular manifestations that are well suited to this small country. We can imagine the obstacles that a judiciary inquiry will meet when investigating such facts: numerous taboos, problems of mentality, and a lack of cultural reference on the issue in order to be able to become aware of or deal with such criminal phenomena, taking advantage in Belgium of official reticence in terms of their acknowledgement, which favours or supports their occultation. The function of a criminal system of this sort is obviously to serve its fundamental purpose, the pursuance of particularly profitable illicit activities, such as money-laundering, and to protect the 'legitimacy' of its activities and the impunity of its agents. This indispensable function corresponds to the motive of criminal protection that assures the permanency of the incriminated system by means of the infiltration of the certain circuits of our institutions, especially the police force, a veritable 'knot' which my whole investigation has come up against."[53]firstnameplaceholder Verwilghen, the chairman of the parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the secondnameplaceholder case, reported attempts in a book he published in 1999 to stifle their investigation into how the case had been handled. Verwilghen eventually published a book that claimed that the commission's findings had been muzzled by political and judicial leaders to prevent the revelation of details that would have implicated the complicity of additional perpetrators. Verwilghen claimed that senior political and legal figures refused to cooperate with the inquiry. He said magistrates and police were officially told to refuse to answer certain questions, in what he described as 'a characteristic smothering operation'. Verwilghen blamed Langlois for refusing to hand over evidence of official protection for secondnameplaceholder. He said that if they had received that information, their report would have been without doubt more precise and detailed. Verwilghen added that for him, the secondnameplaceholder affair was a question of organised crime.[54]The Belgian senator Anne-Marie Lizin commented on the case saying: "Stupidity (by the police) can't be the only explanation. It's a question of stupidity, incompetence and corruption. secondnameplaceholder must be a friend of somebody important. Or else he was being protected because he was known to be a police informant." Lizin said secondnameplaceholder was not a true pedophile, as he has been portrayed. He had a record of dealing in stolen cars, selling arms to hoodlums and trafficking in prostitution. "When he discovered that men paid a lot more for little girls for prostitution, he started kidnapping them," she said. When secondnameplaceholder finally was arrested, police found in his house video films of him raping little girls. They said he did this so he could sell the films to pedophiles.[55]In 2009 WikiLeaks published the secondnameplaceholder Dossier. Belgian authorities tried to have the dossier taken down. The prosecutor general of Liege, Cedric Visart de Bocarme, said "There is some true, some false, some very disparate information here, involving some people who have done nothing wrong, who have simply been mentioned in an investigation and are thus exposed to public contempt, whereas all this material should have remained classified."[56]More than 20 potential witnesses in the case have died in mysterious circumstances.[57]
<h2>Parliamentary investigation and escape from custody</h2>
A 17-month investigation by a parliamentary commission into the secondnameplaceholder affair produced a report in February 1998, which concluded that while secondnameplaceholder did not have accomplices in high positions in the police and justice systems, as he continued to claim, he profited from corruption, sloppiness and incompetence.[citation needed]
<h2>Public outcry</h2>
In October 1996 more than 300,000 Belgians marched through the streets of Brussels after judge Jean-firstnameplaceholder Connerotte was removed from the case. He was removed for attending a fundraising dinner for the families of the victims, which the court system claimed damaged his impartiality.[3] They demanded an investigation and reform of the police and justice system. The protest was called the "White firstnameplaceholderh".[40][3][44] Connerotte was beloved by the public because the only two surviving victims were rescued on his initiative, which made him a national hero.[44] Protesters were wearing signs that said "Stop the cover-up".[44]To protest the prospect of a conditional release of secondnameplaceholder, a "Black firstnameplaceholderh" was organised on the 23rd anniversary of the historic "White firstnameplaceholderh" protest that was held in Brussels on 20 October 1996. The calls to take part in the march were made after it was made public that a court had approved the request of Michel Lelièvre for conditional release, who was an accomplice of secondnameplaceholder and had received a 25-year sentence.[72]The Guardian reported in 2004 that "the entire credibility of the current reformist government of Guy Verhofstadt and Belgium's very reputation as a normal civilised country is on the line."[73]The assassination of André Cools took place in 1991. The revelations in the Cools case coincided with the revelations in the secondnameplaceholder case and in total made the Belgian public lose trust in their government. Van der Biest was eventually convicted but had already been investigated five years prior as the one who ordered the contract hit on Cools. Due to failures in the investigation he wasn't charged. It was found that several Belgian politicians had been bribed with large sums of money by an Italian helicopter manufacturer, Agusta, in exchange for military contracts. This included Belgian secretary general of NATO, Willy Claes. There were allegations that both the assassination of Cools and the case surrounding secondnameplaceholder showed that organised crime had spread in Belgium and that the institutions weren't efficient in combatting the spread or corruption and organised crime.[7]
<h2>Trial</h2>
secondnameplaceholder's trial began on 1 firstnameplaceholderh 2004, some seven and a half years after his initial arrest.[74] It was a trial by jury and up to 450 people were called upon to testify. The trial took place in Arlon, the capital of the Belgian province of Luxembourg, where the investigations had started. secondnameplaceholder was tried for the murders of An firstnameplaceholderhal, Eefje Lambrecks and Bernard Weinstein. While admitting the abductions, he denied all three killings, although he had earlier confessed to killing Weinstein.[74] secondnameplaceholder was also charged with a host of other crimes: auto theft, abduction, attempted murder and attempted abduction, molestation, and three unrelated rapes of women from Slovakia.[75]Martin was tried as an accomplice, as were Lelièvre and Michel Nihoul. To protect the accused, they were made to sit in a glass cage during the trial. In the first week of the trial, photos of secondnameplaceholder's face were not allowed to be printed in Belgian newspapers for privacy reasons; this ban remained in force until 9 firstnameplaceholderh.[76] Throughout the trial, secondnameplaceholder continued to insist that he was part of a Europe-wide paedophile ring with accomplices among police officers, businessmen, doctors, and even high-level Belgian politicians.[77]In a rare move, the jury at the assizes trial publicly protested the presiding judge Stéphane Goux's handling of the debates and the victims' testimonies.[78] On 14 June 2004, after three months of trial, the jury went into seclusion to reach their verdicts on secondnameplaceholder and the three other accused. Verdicts were returned on 17 June 2004 after three days of deliberation.[79] secondnameplaceholder, Martin and Lelièvre were found guilty on all charges; the jury were unable to reach a verdict on Nihoul's role.[79]secondnameplaceholder claimed that he was a low dog in a powerful pedophile network. He further claimed that Michel Nihoul was the organizer of their abductions."[80] He said that he did torture and abuse all of the girls but denied killing any of them until the very end.[81] secondnameplaceholder further denied the kidnapping, raping and murdering Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo. He, however, admitted to incarcerating them at one of his houses.[3] In the case of Lejeune and Russo, secondnameplaceholder also claimed that he had "protected them from a power and sinister child sex ring."[82] His testimony that he never raped Lejeune and Russo, was somewhat supported by examinations of psychiatrists in 1996 stating that secondnameplaceholder didn't fit the pedophile profile. He wasn't attracted to children. But might have chosen to abduct younger victims because they were easier to manipulate and control.[6][check quotation syntax]
secondnameplaceholder admitted to abduction and rape of the other girls. He also admitted to burying his accomplice, Bernard Weinstein, alive for "letting the girls die."[83] secondnameplaceholder further said that two unidentified policemen had taken part with him in the kidnapping of An firstnameplaceholderhal and Eefje Lambrecks.[82] He boasted about having build the dungeon in which firstnameplaceholderhal and Lambrecks were held for a while. He said: "I wanted to create a hiding place to spare them from being sent to a prostitution ring." secondnameplaceholder admitted to raping Lambrecks. He said that Weinstein had raped firstnameplaceholderhal. He also admitted to drugging both of them. secondnameplaceholder also admitted that he kidnapped Sabine Dardenne and raped her. He also admitted to kidnapping and raping Laetitia Delhez but not handing them over to Nihoul "to spare them the fate of An and Eefje."[82] secondnameplaceholder's lawyer, Xavier Magnee, repeatedly said that the prosecution never followed up on evidence of a network surrounding secondnameplaceholder.[83]Martin testified that secondnameplaceholder and Weinstein kidnapped Lejeune and Russo.[82] She also said that secondnameplaceholder had told her that he had murdered Weinstein.[82] Martin further said that secondnameplaceholder and Weinstein had killed firstnameplaceholderhal and Lambrecks.[82] She further testified that Lejeune and Russo starved to death in their basement in 1996 while secondnameplaceholder was in jail. She claims, that she was too scared to descend to the basement.[82]Martin said that secondnameplaceholder had already decided to abduct girls in 1985. He had said that it was easier to abduct and rape girls than having to start affairs with them. This way he would also have more resources and time to spend on her. So she had to help him with the abductions.[47]The X files were testimonies of people who claimed to have been victims of secondnameplaceholder. They had been created after judge Jean-firstnameplaceholder Connerotte had made a public appeal for victims to come forward. In total at least ten victims subsequently contacted the police. All of the witnesses were given the code name "X number". One of the witnesses' names, namely X1, was revealed to be Régina Louf.[3] X1 said that from the age of 11/12 onwards a family friend named Tony Van den Bogaert took her to sex parties with the approval of her family. Several witnesses and family members of Louf confirmed that she had a sexual relationship with Van den Bogaert starting from at least age 12. However, Van den Bogaert has never been interrogated, charged or convicted for sexual abuse. She claimed that other minors were present at the sex parties and that those were secretly filmed for blackmail purposes. She said: "It was highly organised. Big business. Blackmail. There was a lot of money involved." During her testimony she described some regular clients including judges, a prominent politician and one banker. She gave the police names, addresses and detailed description of two murders that matched unsolved cases of the two murders of teenage girls. Louf said that the parties didn't only include sex but also sadism, torture and murder. She claimed that one of the organisers of the parties was a man she knew as Mich (Jean Michel Nihoul). Louf described him as a cruel man, who sadistically tortured girls.[3]Louf said that secondnameplaceholder was at that time a young man who brought drugs to the parties for the girls to numb themselves and took care of them in other ways. As a reward he was also allowed to use them for his pleasure.[3] The crimes that Louf described took place about ten years prior to the arrest of secondnameplaceholder.[3] Louf's full name was leaked to the press. She was subsequently made out to look like a fantasist and liar.[3] The new presiding judges declared that she was not a credible witness and that her testimony and the testimony of the other X witnesses would not be used during the trial.[3]One of the other X witnesses, whose real name wasn't revealed, but who's now working for the police, said that they had witnessed and experienced similar abuse. They also recounted instances where children were chased through the woods with Dobermans.[41]Witness X3 testified that one of the people present at the gatherings that involved sex orgies with minors, torture and murder was Willy Claes, secretary general of the NATO. Claes resigned after he was found guilty of corruption in a tendering process for a large defence contract connected to Agusta helicopters, a large military-helicopter producer from Italy.[41]The testimony of X2 implicated that Etienne Davignon, Maurice Lippens, Paul Vanden Boeynants, Benoît de Bonvoisin and Prince Alexandre of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha were named as having been present at orgies involving underaged persons.[53]A book was published in November 1999 titled: The X-Files: What Belgium Was Not Supposed to Know About the secondnameplaceholder Affair. It was written by two journalists from the Flemish Belgian newspaper De Morgen, Annemie Bulte and Douglas De Coninck and another journalist from the French Belgian newspaper Journal du Mardi, Marie-Jeanne Van Heeswyck. It claimed that the X witnesses were much more believable than stated by the media. But it also stated that there had been substantial efforts by the magistrates and senior police officials to demolish the testimony of the X-witnesses. The father of a police officer that was murdered while investigating a car smuggling ring, Judge Guy Poncelet, said that the book was brilliant and convincing. He said he believed that crucial evidence had been downplayed by the authorities.[41]The death penalty was abolished in Belgium in 1996. The last execution for common-law crimes was in 1918. However, the majority of Belgians, at the time of the trial, would have had no problem with secondnameplaceholder receiving the death penalty.[84] On 22 June 2004, secondnameplaceholder received the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, while Martin received 30 years and Lelièvre 25 years. The jury was asked to go back into seclusion to decide whether or not Nihoul was an accomplice.[citation needed]On 23 June, secondnameplaceholder lodged an appeal against his sentence.[85]Although Nihoul was acquitted of kidnapping and conspiracy charges, he was convicted on drug-related charges and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Nihoul was released in spring 2006. He resided in Zeebrugge until his death on 23 October 2019.[citation needed]On 19 August 2012, about 2,000 people in Brussels demonstrated against Martin's possible early release from prison. She has since been paroled, 16 years into her sentence,[86] and was released into the care of the Poor Clares in Malonne. She was given shelter, although she was not part of the community. The sisters have declared that they were not her guardian and shelter was given under the condition that she would not violate the conditions of her parole.[87] As the convent has since been sold, she has had to find new shelter or go back to prison. A former judge has created an apartment in his converted farmhouse, where she now lives.[88][89]Lelièvre is currently serving his prison sentence in the prison of Ittre. His application for parole in 2013 was denied.[citation needed] He has since then been granted temporary leave, but has violated the conditions of release. He may be released if he can find an apprenticeship as a cabinet-maker, which has so far been unsuccessful. The Belgian state was forced to pay Lelièvre €6,000. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that a moral compensation was in order because he was held in custody (nearly eight years) without receiving answers to his requests.[citation needed]On 4 February 2013, secondnameplaceholder requested the court in Brussels for an early release from prison.[90] He insisted that he was "no longer dangerous" and wanted to be released into house arrest with an electronic tag (ankle bracelet) placed upon him. On 18 February, the court denied his request.[91]
secondnameplaceholder is currently being held in solitary confinement in the prison of Nivelles.[92]In October 2019, secondnameplaceholder won the pre-parole right to a psychiatric assessment,[93] which was supposed to take place in May 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[94]Michel Nihoul was a businessman known to frequently attend sex parties. He was accused of being the brains behind the child kidnapping and abuse operation around secondnameplaceholder.[3] According to Vos, Nihoul was charged in relation to the case with "kidnapping, rape, conspiracy and drug offenses."[46] Nihoul's lawyer in the case, Frederic Clement de Clety, denied all charges made against Nihoul by secondnameplaceholder and called him a "liar and manipulator."[82] When the investigative journalist Olenka Frenkiel met Nihoul in Brussels, he reportedly greeted her with the words "I am the monster of Belgium." He told her that he was certain that he would never be prosecuted. During the encounter he grabbed her, tickled her and pulled her onto him so that she called for her colleagues to help her get away from him. Frenkiel was working on a documentary on the case for the BBC.[3] In 2004 at the end of the secondnameplaceholder case trial he was released of all charges of child abduction.[98] In May 2010 the Belgian prosecutor's office dropped all charges against Nihoul relating to a participation to a pedophile ring in the absence of any tangible evidence.[99]
<h2>Effects in Belgium</h2>
The secondnameplaceholder case is so infamous that more than a third of Belgians with the surname "secondnameplaceholder" applied to have their surname changed between 1996 and 1998.[100]

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (born May 10, 1955) is an incarcerated American who killed former Beatle John Lennon in New York City on December 8, 1980. As Lennon walked into the archway of his apartment at The Dakota, Chapman fired five shots at Lennon from a few yards away with a Charter Arms Undercover .38 Special revolver. Lennon was hit four times from the back. Chapman remained at the scene reading J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye until he was arrested by police. He planned to cite the novel as his manifesto. At his 2020 parole hearing, Chapman stated that he was "seeking self-glory" in killing a famous celebrity.Raised in Decatur, Georgia, Chapman had been a fan of the Beatles, but was incensed by Lennon's lifestyle and public statements, such as his remark about the Beatles being "more popular than Jesus" and the lyrics of his later songs "God" and "Imagine". In the years leading up to the murder, Chapman developed a series of obsessions, including artwork and the music of Todd Rundgren. The Catcher in the Rye took on great personal significance for him, to the extent that he wished to model his life after the novel's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Chapman also contemplated killing other public figures, including Johnny Carson, Paul McCartney, and Ronald Reagan. He had no prior criminal convictions and had just resigned from a job as a security guard in Hawaii.Following the murder, Chapman's legal team intended to mount an insanity defense that would be based on the testimony of mental health experts who said that he was in a delusional psychotic state. He was more cooperative with the prosecutor, who argued that his symptoms fell short of a schizophrenia diagnosis. As the trial approached, he instructed his lawyers that he wanted to plead guilty based on what he had decided was the will of God. The judge granted Chapman's request and deemed him competent to stand trial. He was sentenced to a prison term of 20 years to life with a stipulation that mental health treatment would be provided.Chapman refused requests for press interviews during his first six years in prison; he later said that he regretted the murder and did not want to give the impression that he killed Lennon for fame and notoriety. He ultimately supplied audiotaped interviews to journalist Jack Jones, who used them to write the investigative book Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in 1992. In 2000, Chapman became eligible for parole, which has since been denied eleven times.
<h2>Background</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born on May 10, 1955, in Fort Worth, Texas.[1] His father, secondnameplaceholder, was a staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force and his mother, Diane (née Pease), was a nurse. His younger sister, Susan, was born seven years later. As a boy, Chapman stated he lived in fear of his father, who he said was physically abusive towards his mother and unloving towards him. Chapman began to fantasize about having king-like power over a group of imaginary "little people" who lived in the walls of his bedroom. He attended Columbia High School in Decatur, Georgia. By the time he was 14, Chapman was using drugs and skipping classes. He once ran away from home to live on the streets of Atlanta for two weeks. He said he was bullied at school because he was not a good athlete.[5]In 1971, Chapman became a born-again Presbyterian and distributed Biblical tracts. He met his first girlfriend, Jessica Blankenship, and began work as a summer camp counselor at the South DeKalb County, Georgia YMCA. He was very popular with the children, who nicknamed him "Nemo" and was made assistant director after winning an award for Outstanding Counselor.[6] Those who knew him in the caretaking professions unanimously called him an outstanding worker.[7]Chapman read J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye on the recommendation of a friend. The novel eventually took on great personal significance for him, to the extent he reportedly wished to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.[8] After graduating from Columbia High School, Chapman moved for a time to Chicago and played guitar in churches and Christian night spots while his friend did impersonations. He worked successfully for World Vision with Vietnamese refugees at a resettlement camp at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, after a brief visit to Lebanon for the same work. He was named an area coordinator and a key aide to program director David Moore, who later said Chapman cared deeply for the children and worked hard. Chapman accompanied Moore to meetings with government officials, and President Gerald Ford shook his hand.Chapman joined Blankenship as a student at Covenant College, an evangelical Presbyterian liberal arts college in Lookout Mountain, Georgia. However, Chapman fell behind in his studies and became obsessed with guilt over having an affair.[9][10] He started having suicidal thoughts and began to feel like a failure. He dropped out of Covenant College after just one semester and his girlfriend broke off their relationship soon after. Chapman returned to work at the resettlement camp but left after an argument. He then worked as a security guard, eventually taking a week-long course to qualify as an armed guard. In 1977, Chapman moved to Hawaii, where he attempted suicide by carbon monoxide asphyxiation. He connected a hose to his car's exhaust pipe but the hose melted and the attempt failed. A psychiatrist admitted Chapman to Castle Memorial Hospital for clinical depression. Upon his release, he began working at the hospital.[11] After Chapman's parents began divorce proceedings, his mother joined him in Hawaii.[10]In 1978, Chapman went on a six-week trip around the world. The vacation was partly inspired by the film Around the World in Eighty Days. He visited Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Delhi, Beirut, Geneva, London, Paris and Dublin. He began a relationship with his travel agent, a Japanese American woman named Gloria Abe, whom he married on June 2, 1979. Chapman got a job at Castle Memorial Hospital as a printer, working alone rather than with staff and patients. He was fired by the hospital, rehired, then got into a shouting match with a nurse and quit. After this, Chapman took a job as a night security guard and began drinking heavily.[11] He developed a series of obsessions, including artwork, The Catcher in the Rye, music, and the musician John Lennon. In September 1980, he wrote a letter to a friend, Lynda Irish, in which he stated, "I'm going nuts." He signed the letter, "The Catcher in the Rye."[12] Chapman had no criminal convictions prior to his trip to New York City to kill Lennon.[13]
<h2>Murder of John Lennon</h2>
Chapman allegedly started planning to kill English musician John Lennon three months prior to the murder. A longtime fan of Lennon's band the Beatles, Chapman turned against Lennon following a religious conversion, and was angry about Lennon's highly publicized 1966 comment that the Beatles were "more popular than Jesus.".[14] Some members of Chapman's prayer group made a joke in reference to Lennon's song "Imagine": "It went, 'Imagine, imagine if John Lennon was dead.'"[10] Chapman's childhood friend Miles McManushe recalled that he said that the song was "communist".[14]Chapman had also been influenced by Anthony Fawcett's John Lennon: One Day at a Time about Lennon's lifestyle in New York. According to his wife Gloria, "He was angry that Lennon would preach love and peace but yet have millions". Chapman later said: "He told us to imagine no possessions and there he was, with millions of dollars and yachts and farms and country estates, laughing at people like me who had believed the lies and bought the records and built a big part of their lives around his music."[4] He also recalled having listened to Lennon's solo albums in the weeks before the murder:[15]Chapman's planning has been described as "muddled."[17]  Over the years, Chapman has both supported and denied whether he felt justified by his spiritual beliefs at the time or had the intention of acquiring notoriety.[3] The only time he made a public statement before his sentencing — and for several years afterward — was during a brief psychotic episode in which he was convinced that the meaning of his actions was to promote The Catcher in the Rye, which amounted to a single letter mailed to The New York Times asking the public to read the novel.[3] According to Chapman, he had an alternate hit list of potential targets in mind, including Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney, talk show host Johnny Carson, actress Elizabeth Taylor, actor George C. Scott, former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, just-elected US president Ronald Reagan, and Hawaii governor George Ariyoshi. In 2010, he said that the only criterion for the list was being "famous", and that he chose Lennon out of convenience.[18] Journalist James R. Gaines, who interviewed Chapman extensively, concluded that Chapman did not kill Lennon to become a celebrity.[3]It is rumored that Chapman traveled to Woodstock, New York, during one of his visits to the state in search of Todd Rundgren, another target of obsession. Chapman was wearing a promotional T-shirt for Rundgren's album Hermit of Mink Hollow when he was arrested and had a copy of Runt. The Ballad of Todd Rundgren in his hotel room. Rundgren was not aware of the connections until much later.[19] On the day of the murder, singer David Bowie was appearing on Broadway in the play The Elephant Man. "I was second on his list," Bowie later said. "Chapman had a front-row ticket to The Elephant Man the next night. John and Yoko were supposed to sit front-row for that show too. So the night after John was killed there were three empty seats in the front row. I can't tell you how difficult that was to go on. I almost didn't make it through the performance."[20]Chapman went to New York in October 1980 intending to kill Lennon, but left to obtain ammunition from his unwitting friend in Atlanta before returning in November.[12] During his October trip to New York, Chapman was inspired by the film Ordinary People to stop his plans. He returned to Hawaii and told his wife that he had been obsessed with killing Lennon. Chapman showed her the gun and bullets, but she did not inform the police or mental health services.[10] Chapman later said that the message "Thou Shalt Not Kill" flashed on the television at him and was on a wall hanging that his wife put up in their apartment.[4] He made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist, but he did not keep it and flew back to New York on December 6, 1980.[10] At one point, he considered ending his life by jumping from the Statue of Liberty.[21]On December 7, Chapman accosted singer James Taylor at the 72nd Street subway station. According to Taylor, "The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon."[22] He also reportedly offered cocaine to a taxi driver.[10] That night, Chapman and his wife talked on the phone about getting help with his problems by first working on his relationship with God.[4]On the morning of December 8, Chapman left his room at the Sheraton Hotel, leaving personal items behind that he wanted the police to find. He bought a copy of The Catcher in the Rye in which he wrote "This is my statement", signing it "Holden Caulfield." He then spent most of the day near the entrance to the Dakota apartment building where Lennon lived, talking to fans and the doorman. Early in the morning, Chapman was distracted and missed seeing Lennon step out of a cab and enter the Dakota. Later in the morning, he met Lennon's housekeeper who was returning from a walk with Lennon's five-year-old son Sean. Chapman reached in front of the housekeeper to shake Sean's hand and said that he was a beautiful boy, quoting Lennon's song "Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)".[23]Around 5 p.m., Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono were leaving the Dakota for a recording session at Record Plant Studios. As they walked toward their limousine without saying a word, Chapman held out Lennon's record for Lennon to sign a copy of his album Double Fantasy.[24] Amateur photographer Paul Goresh (1959–2018)[25] was standing by and took a picture as Lennon signed the album. Chapman said in an interview that he tried to get Goresh to stay, and he asked another loitering Lennon fan to go out with him that night. He suggested that he would not have murdered Lennon that evening if the girl had accepted his invitation or if Goresh had stayed, but he probably would have tried another day.[23]Around 10:50 p.m., Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota in a limousine. They got out of the vehicle, passed Chapman, and walked toward the archway entrance of the building. From the street behind them, Chapman fired five hollow-point bullets from a .38 special revolver, four of which hit Lennon in the back and shoulder, puncturing his left lung and left subclavian artery.[citation needed][26] One newspaper later reported that Chapman softly called out "Mr. Lennon" before firing, then dropped into a combat stance.[27] Chapman said that he does not recall saying anything, and Lennon did not turn around.[28]Chapman remained at the scene and appeared to be reading The Catcher in the Rye when the NYPD officers arrived and arrested him without incident. The first responders recognized that Lennon's wounds were severe and decided not to wait for an ambulance; they rushed him to Roosevelt Hospital in a squad car. Lennon was pronounced dead on arrival. Three hours later, Chapman told the police, "I'm sure the big part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil."[29]
<h2>Legal process</h2>
Chapman was charged with second-degree murder. He told police that he had used hollow-point bullets "to ensure Lennon's death".[30]  Gloria Chapman had known of her husband's preparations for killing Lennon, but she took no action because Chapman did not follow through at the time; she was not charged.[31] Chapman later said that he harbored a "deep-seated resentment" toward his wife, "that she didn't go to somebody, even the police, and say, 'Look, my husband's bought a gun and he says he's going to kill John Lennon.'"[32]More than a dozen psychologists and psychiatrists interviewed Chapman in the six months prior to his trial—three for the prosecution, six for the defense, and several more on behalf of the court—and they conducted a battery of standard diagnostic procedures and more than 200 hours of clinical interviews. All six defense experts concluded that Chapman was psychotic; five diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia, while the sixth felt that his symptoms were more consistent with manic depression. The three prosecution experts declared that his delusions fell short of psychosis and instead diagnosed various personality disorders. The court-appointed experts concurred with the prosecution's examiners that he was delusional yet competent to stand trial. In the examinations, Chapman was more cooperative with the prosecution's mental health experts than with those for the defense; one psychiatrist conjectured that he did not wish to be considered "crazy" and was persuaded that the defense experts only declared him insane because they were hired to do so.[3]Charles McGowan had been pastor of Chapman's church in Decatur, Georgia, and he visited Chapman. "I believe there was a demonic power at work," he said. Chapman initially embraced his old religion with new fervor as a result; but McGowan revealed information to the press that Chapman had told him in confidence, so Chapman disavowed his renewed interest in Christianity and reverted to his initial explanation: he had killed Lennon to promote the reading of The Catcher in the Rye.[3]Chapman's court-appointed lawyer Herbert Adlerberg withdrew from the case amid threats of lynching. Police feared that Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to Rikers Island for his personal safety.[33]At the initial hearing in January 1981, Chapman's new lawyer Jonathan firstnameplaceholders instructed him to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In February, Chapman sent a handwritten statement to The New York Times urging everyone to read The Catcher in the Rye, calling it an "extraordinary book that holds many answers."[34] The defense team sought to establish witnesses as to Chapman's mental state at the time of the killing.[35] However, Chapman told firstnameplaceholders in June that he wanted to drop the insanity defense and plead guilty. firstnameplaceholders objected with "serious questions" over Chapman's sanity and legally challenged his competence to make this decision. In the pursuant hearing on June 22, Chapman said that God had told him to plead guilty and that he would not change his plea or ever appeal, regardless of his sentence. firstnameplaceholders told the court that he opposed Chapman's change of plea but Chapman would not listen to him. Judge Dennis Edwards refused a further assessment, saying that Chapman had made the decision of his own free will, and declared him competent to plead guilty.[7][36][37]The sentencing hearing took place on August 24, 1981. Two experts gave evidence on Chapman's behalf. Judge Edwards interrupted Dorothy Lewis, a research psychiatrist who was relatively inexperienced in the courtroom, indicating that the purpose of the hearing was to determine the sentence and there was no question of Chapman's criminal responsibility. Lewis had maintained that Chapman's decision to change his plea did not appear reasonable or explicable, and she implied that the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment.[38] The district attorney argued that Chapman committed the murder as an easy route to fame. Chapman was asked if he had anything to say, and he rose and read a passage from The Catcher in the Rye in which Holden tells his little sister Phoebe what he wants to do with his life:The judge ordered psychiatric treatment for Chapman during his incarceration and sentenced him to 20 years to life, 5 years less than the maximum sentence of 25 years to life.[39]
<h2>Imprisonment</h2>
In 1981, Chapman was imprisoned at Attica Correctional Facility outside of Buffalo, New York. He fasted for 26 days in February 1982, so the New York State Supreme Court authorized the state to force-feed him. Central New York Psychiatric Center director Martin Von Holden said that Chapman refused to eat with other inmates but agreed to take liquid nutrients.[40] He was confined to a special handling unit (SHU) for violent and at-risk prisoners, in part due to concern that he might be harmed by Lennon's fans in the general population. There were 105 prisoners in the building who were "not considered a threat to him," according to the New York State Department of Correctional Services. He had his own cell, but spent "most of his day outside his cell working on housekeeping and in the library."[41]Chapman worked in the prison as a legal clerk and kitchen helper. He was barred from participating in the Cephas Attica workshops, a charitable organization helping inmates adjust to life outside prison. He was also prohibited from attending the prison's violence and anger management classes due to concern for his safety. He told a parole board in 2004 what he would do if paroled: "I would immediately try to find a job, and I really want to go from place to place, at least in the state, church to church, and tell people what happened to me and point them the way to Christ." He also said that he thought that he could find work as a farmhand or return to his previous trade as a printer.[42]Chapman is in the Family Reunion Program and is allowed one conjugal visit[43] a year with his wife, since he accepted solitary confinement. The program allows him to spend up to 48 hours alone with his wife in a specially built prison home. He also gets occasional visits from his sister, clergy, and a few friends. In 2004, Department of Correctional Services spokesman James Flateau said that Chapman had been involved in three "minor incidents" between 1989 and 1994 for delaying an inmate count and refusing to follow an order.[44] On May 15, 2012, he was transferred to the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York, which is east of Buffalo.
<h2>Book, interviews, and media appearances</h2>
Chapman refused all requests for interviews following the murder and during his first six years at Attica, later saying that he did not want to give the impression that he killed Lennon for fame and notoriety.[29] James R. Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word People magazine series starting in 1981 and climaxing in February and March 1987.[3][45][46] Chapman told the parole board that he regretted the interview.[citation needed] He later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, and Jones published Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, the Man Who Killed John Lennon in 1992.[47]On December 4, 1992, ABC's 20/20 aired an interview with Barbara Walters, Chapman's first television interview.[48] On December 17, 1992, Larry King interviewed Chapman on his CNN program Larry King Live.[49] Jones asked Chapman to tell his story for Mugshots, a CourtTV program in 2000, with his first parole hearing approaching. Chapman refused to go on camera but consented to tell his story in a series of audiotapes.[citation needed]
<h2>Parole applications, campaigns, and denial</h2>
Chapman first became eligible for parole in 2000 after serving twenty years in prison. Under New York state law, he is required to have a parole hearing every two years from that year beyond. Since that time, a three-member board has denied Chapman parole eleven times. Before Chapman's first parole hearing, Yoko Ono sent a letter to the board requesting that Chapman should stay behind bars for the remainder of his life sentence.[50][51] In addition, New York State Senator Michael Nozzolio, chairman of the Senate Crime Victims, Crime and Correction Committee, wrote to Parole Board Chairman Brion Travis saying: "It is the responsibility of the New York State Parole Board to ensure that public safety is protected from the release of dangerous criminals like Chapman."[52]
<h2>Similar incidents</h2>
John Hinckley tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan less than four months after Lennon's murder, and police found a copy of Catcher in the Rye among his personal belongings.[76] He left a cassette tape in his hotel room on which he stated that he mourned Lennon's death: "One of my idols was murdered, and now Jodie Foster's the only one left." He added that "anything that I might do in 1981 would be solely for Jodie Foster's sake."[77]
<h2>In film</h2>
Two biographical films center on Chapman and the murder:
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder bin Mohammed bin Awad secondnameplaceholder[1][7] /oʊˈsɑːmə bɪn ˈlɑːdən/ (Arabic: أسا‌مة بن محمد بن عو‌ض بن لا‌د‌ن‎, Usāmah bin Muḥammad bin Awaḍ bin Lādin; March 10, 1957 – May 2, 2011),[8] also rendered Usama bin Ladin, was a founder of the pan-Islamic militant organization al-Qaeda. The group is designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, and various countries.He was a Saudi Arabian citizen until 1994 and a member of the wealthy secondnameplaceholder family.[9] Bin Laden's father was Mohammed bin Awad secondnameplaceholder, a Saudi millionaire from Hadhramaut, Yemen, and the founder of the construction company, Saudi Binladin Group.[10] His mother, Alia Ghanem, was from a secular middle-class family in Latakia, Syria.[11] He was born in Saudi Arabia and studied at university in the country until 1979, when he joined Mujahideen forces in Pakistan fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He helped to fund the Mujahideen by funneling arms, money, and fighters from the Arab world into Afghanistan, and gained popularity among many Arabs.[12] In 1988, he formed al-Qaeda.[13] He was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, and shifted his base to Sudan, until U.S. pressure forced him to leave Sudan in 1996. After establishing a new base in Afghanistan, he declared a war against the United States, initiating a series of bombings and related attacks.[14] Bin Laden was on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists for his involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings.[15][16][17]Bin Laden is most well known for his role in masterminding the September 11 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 and prompted the United States on the orders of President George W. Bush, to initiate the War on Terror. He subsequently became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt. From 2001 to 2011, secondnameplaceholder was a major target of the United States, as the FBI offered a $25 million bounty in their search for him.[18] On May 2, 2011,[19] secondnameplaceholder was shot and killed[20] by US Navy SEALs inside a private residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he lived with a local family from Waziristan. The covert operation was conducted by members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (SEAL Team Six) and Central Intelligence Agency SAD/SOG operators on the orders of U.S. President Barack Obama.[21] Under secondnameplaceholder's leadership, the al-Qaeda organization was responsible for, in addition to the September 11 attacks in the United States, many other mass-casualty attacks worldwide.[22][23][24]
<h2>Name</h2>
There is no universally accepted standard for transliterating Arabic words and Arabic names into English;[25] however, secondnameplaceholder's name is most frequently rendered "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder". The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S. governmental agencies, have used either "Usama secondnameplaceholder" or "Usama bin Ladin". Less common renderings include "Ussamah bin Ladin" and, in the French-language media, "Oussama ben Laden". Other spellings include "Binladen" or, as used by his family in the West, "Binladin". The decapitalization of bin is based on the convention of leaving short prepositions, articles, and patronymics uncapitalized in surnames; the nasab bin means "son of". The spellings with o and e come from a Persian-influenced pronunciation also used in Afghanistan, where secondnameplaceholder spent many years.firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's full name, firstnameplaceholder bin Mohammed bin Awad secondnameplaceholder, means "firstnameplaceholder, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden".[1] "Mohammed" refers to secondnameplaceholder's father Mohammed secondnameplaceholder; "Awad" refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud secondnameplaceholder, a Kindite Hadhrami tribesman; "Laden" refers not to secondnameplaceholder's great-grandfather, who was named Aboud, but to Aboud's father, Laden Ali al-Qahtani.[26]The Arabic linguistic convention would be to refer to him as "firstnameplaceholder" or "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder", not "secondnameplaceholder" alone, as "secondnameplaceholder" is a patronymic, not a surname in the Western manner. According to secondnameplaceholder's son Omar secondnameplaceholder, the family's hereditary surname is "al-Qahtani" (Arabic: القحطاني‎, āl-Qaḥṭānī), but secondnameplaceholder's father, Mohammed secondnameplaceholder, never officially registered the name.[27]firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder had also assumed the kunyah "Abū 'Abdāllāh" ("father of Abdallah"). His admirers have referred to him by several nicknames, including the "Prince" or "Emir" (الأمير, al-Amīr), the "Sheik" (الشيخ, aš-Šaykh), the "Jihadist Sheik" or "Sheik al-Mujahid" (شيخ المجاهد, Šaykh al-Mujāhid), "Hajj" (حج, Ḥajj), and the "Director".[28] The word usāmah (أسامة) means "lion",[29] earning him the nicknames "Lion" and "Lion Sheik".[30]
<h2>Early life and education</h2>
firstnameplaceholder bin Mohammed bin Awad secondnameplaceholder[1][31] was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a son of Yemeni Mohammed bin Awad secondnameplaceholder, a billionaire  construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family,[32] and Mohammed secondnameplaceholder's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem).[33] In a 1998 interview, secondnameplaceholder gave his birth date as March 10, 1957.[34]Mohammed secondnameplaceholder divorced Hamida soon after firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born. Mohammed recommended Hamida to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s, and they are still together.[35] The couple had four children, and secondnameplaceholder lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half-sister.[33] The secondnameplaceholder family made $5 billion in the construction industry, of which firstnameplaceholder later inherited around $25–30 million.[36]Bin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim.[37] From 1968 to 1976, he attended the elite Al-Thager Model School.[33][38] He studied economics and business administration[39] at King Abdulaziz University. Some reports suggest he earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979,[40] or a degree in public administration in 1981.[41] Bin Laden was an attendant at an English-language course in Oxford, England during 1971.[42] One source described him as "hard working";[43] another said he left university during his third year without completing a college degree.[44] At university, secondnameplaceholder's main interest was religion, where he was involved in both "interpreting the Quran and jihad" and charitable work.[45] Other interests included writing poetry;[46] reading, with the works of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in which he enjoyed playing at centre forward and followed the English club Arsenal.[47]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
At age 17 in 1974, secondnameplaceholder married Najwa Ghanhem at Latakia, Syria;[48] they were separated before September 11, 2001. Bin Laden's other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sabar (married 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000). Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to secondnameplaceholder was annulled soon after the ceremony.[49] Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives.[50][51] Many of secondnameplaceholder's children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks and as of 2010[update], Iranian authorities reportedly continue to control their movements.[52]Nasser al-Bahri, who was secondnameplaceholder's personal bodyguard from 1997–2001, details secondnameplaceholder's personal life in his memoir. He describes him as a frugal man and strict father, who enjoyed taking his large family on shooting trips and picnics in the desert.[53]Bin Laden's father Mohammed died in 1967 in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his American pilot Jim Harrington[54] misjudged a landing.[55] Bin Laden's eldest half-brother, Salem secondnameplaceholder, the subsequent head of the secondnameplaceholder family, was killed in 1988 near San Antonio, Texas, in the United States, when he accidentally flew a plane into power lines.[56]The FBI described secondnameplaceholder as an adult as tall and thin, between 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) and 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) in height and weighing about 73 kilograms (160 lb), although the author Lawrence Wright, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on al-Qaeda, The Looming Tower, writes that a number of secondnameplaceholder's close friends confirmed that reports of his height were greatly exaggerated, and that secondnameplaceholder was actually "just over 6 feet (1.8 m) tall".[57] Eventually, after his death, he was measured to be around 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in).[58] Bin Laden had an olive complexion and was left-handed, usually walking with a cane. He wore a plain white keffiyeh. Bin Laden had stopped wearing the traditional Saudi male keffiyeh and instead wore the traditional Yemeni male keffiyeh.[59] Bin Laden was described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered in demeanor.[60]
<h2>Beliefs and ideology</h2>
A major component of secondnameplaceholder's ideology was the concept that civilians from enemy countries, including women and children, were legitimate targets for jihadists to kill.[61][62] According to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, who led the CIA's hunt for firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, the al-Qaeda leader was motivated by a belief that U.S. foreign policy has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East.[63] As such, the threat to U.S. national security arises not from al-Qaeda being offended by what America is but rather by what America does, or in the words of Scheuer, "They (al-Qaeda) hate us (Americans) for what we do, not who we are." Nonetheless, secondnameplaceholder criticized the U.S. for its secular form of governance, calling upon Americans to convert to Islam and reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, and usury, in a letter published in late 2002.[64]Bin Laden believed that the Islamic world was in crisis and that the complete restoration of Sharia law would be the only way to set things right in the Muslim world. He opposed such alternatives as secular government,[64] as well as pan-Arabism, socialism, communism, and democracy.[65] He subscribed to the Athari (literalist) school of Islamic theology.[66]These beliefs, in conjunction with violent jihad, have sometimes been called Qutbism after being promoted by Sayyid Qutb.[67] Bin Laden believed that Afghanistan, under the rule of Mullah Omar's Taliban, was "the only Islamic country" in the Muslim world.[68] Bin Laden consistently dwelt on the need for violent jihad to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the United States and sometimes by other non-Muslim states.[69] He also called for the elimination of Israel, and called upon the United States to withdraw all of its civilians and military personnel from the Middle East, as well as from every Islamic country of the world.His viewpoints and methods of achieving them had led to him being designated as a terrorist by scholars,[70][71] journalists from The New York Times,[72][73] the BBC,[74] and Qatari news station Al Jazeera,[75] analysts such as Peter Bergen,[76] Michael Scheuer,[77] Marc Sageman,[78] and Bruce Hoffman.[79][80] He was indicted on terrorism charges by law enforcement agencies in Madrid, New York City, and Tripoli.[81]In 1997, he condemned the United States for its hypocrisy in not labeling the bombing of Hiroshima as terrorism. In November 2001, he maintained that the revenge killing of Americans was justified because he claimed that Islamic law allows believers to attack invaders even when the enemy uses human shields. However, according to Rodenbeck, "this classical position was originally intended as a legal justification for the accidental killings of civilians under very limited circumstances — not as a basis for the intentional targeting of noncombatants."[82] A few months later in a 2002 letter, he made no mention of this justification but claimed "that since the United States is a democracy, all citizens bear responsibility for its government's actions, and civilians are therefore fair targets."[82][83]Bin Laden's overall strategy for achieving his goals against much larger enemies such as the Soviet Union and United States was to lure them into a long war of attrition in Muslim countries, attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. He believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy countries, by "bleeding" them dry.[84] Al-Qaeda manuals express this strategy. In a 2004 tape broadcast by Al Jazeera, secondnameplaceholder spoke of "bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy".[85]A number of errors and inconsistencies in secondnameplaceholder's arguments have been alleged by authors such as Max Rodenbeck and Noah Feldman. He invoked democracy both as an example of the deceit and fraudulence of Western political system—American law being "the law of the rich and wealthy"[86]—and as the reason civilians are responsible for their government's actions and so can be lawfully punished by death.[87] He denounced democracy as a "religion of ignorance" that violates Islam by issuing man-made laws, but in a later statement compares the Western democracy of Spain favorably to the Muslim world in which the ruler is accountable. Rodenbeck states, "Evidently, [secondnameplaceholder] has never heard theological justifications for democracy, based on the notion that the will of the people must necessarily reflect the will of an all-knowing God."[82]Bin Laden was heavily anti-Semitic, stating that most of the negative events that occurred in the world were the direct result of Jewish actions. In a December 1998 interview with Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, secondnameplaceholder stated that Operation Desert Fox was proof that Israeli Jews controlled the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, directing them to kill as many Muslims as they could.[88] In a letter released in late 2002, he stated that Jews controlled the civilian media outlets, politics, and economic institutions of the United States.[64] In a May 1998 interview with ABC's John Miller, secondnameplaceholder stated that the Israeli state's ultimate goal was to annex the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East into its territory and enslave its peoples, as part of what he called a "Greater Israel".[89] He stated that Jews and Muslims could never get along and that war was "inevitable" between them, and further accused the U.S. of stirring up anti-Islamic sentiment.[89] He claimed that the U.S. State Department and U.S. Department of Defense were controlled by Jews, for the sole purpose of serving the Israeli state's goals.[89] He often delivered warnings against alleged Jewish conspiracies: "These Jews are masters of usury and leaders in treachery. They will leave you nothing, either in this world or the next."[90] Shia Muslims have been listed along with heretics, America, and Israel as the four principal enemies of Islam at ideology classes of secondnameplaceholder's al-Qaeda organization.[91]Bin Laden was opposed to music on religious grounds,[92] and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in earth-moving machinery and genetic engineering of plants on the one hand, but rejected chilled water on the other.[93]Bin Laden also believed climate change to be a serious threat and penned a letter urging Americans to work with President Barack Obama to make a rational decision to "save humanity from the harmful gases that threaten its destiny".[94][95]
<h2>Militant and political career</h2>
After leaving college in 1979, secondnameplaceholder went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Soviet–Afghan War.[96] He later told a journalist: "I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan."[97] From 1979 to 1992, the United States (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6–12 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).[98] British journalist Jason Burke wrote that "He did not receive any direct funding or training from the US during the 1980s. Nor did his followers. The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency, received large amounts of both. Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant."[99] Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI.[100] According to some CIA officers, beginning in early 1980, secondnameplaceholder acted as a liaison between the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) and Afghan warlords, but no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives. Steve Coll states that although secondnameplaceholder may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, "it seems clear that secondnameplaceholder did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence."[101] Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S. Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed.[102]By 1984, secondnameplaceholder and Azzam established Maktab al-Khidamat, which funneled money, arms, and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, secondnameplaceholder's inherited family fortune[103] paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Between 1986 and 1987, secondnameplaceholder set up a base in eastern Afghanistan for several dozen of his own Arab soldiers.[104] From this base, secondnameplaceholder participated in some combat activity against the Soviets, such as the Battle of Jaji in 1987.[104] Despite its little strategic significance, the battle was lionized in the mainstream Arab press.[104] It was during this time that he became idolised by many Arabs.[12]In May 1988, responding to rumours of a massacre of Sunnis by Shias, large numbers of Shias from in and around Gilgit, Pakistan were killed in a massacre.[105] Shia civilians were also subjected to rape.[106]The massacre is alleged by B. Raman, a founder of India's Research and Analysis Wing,[107] to have been in response to a revolt by the Shias of Gilgit during the rule of military dictator Zia-ul Haq.[108] He alleged that the Pakistan Army induced firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder to lead an armed group of Sunni tribals, from Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province, into Gilgit and its surrounding areas to suppress the revolt.[109]By 1988, secondnameplaceholder had split from Maktab al-Khidamat. While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, secondnameplaceholder wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force.[110] Notes of a meeting of secondnameplaceholder and others on August 20, 1988 indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: "Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious." A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat) to follow one's superiors.[111]According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret.[112] His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between several senior leaders of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Abdullah Azzam, and secondnameplaceholder, where it was agreed to join secondnameplaceholder's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.[113]Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder returned to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad.[114] Along with his Arab legion, he was thought to have brought down the mighty superpower of the Soviet Union.[115] After his return to Saudi Arabia, secondnameplaceholder engaged in opposition movements to the Saudi monarchy while working for his family business.[114] He offered to send al-Qaeda to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Yemeni Socialist Party government in South Yemen but was rebuffed by Prince Turki bin Faisal. He then tried to disrupt the Yemeni unification process by assassinating YSP leaders but was halted by Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz after President Ali Abdullah Saleh complained to King Fahd.[116] He was also angered by the internecine tribal fighting among the Afghans.[12] However, he continued working with the Saudi GID and the Pakistani ISI. He funded the 1990 Afghan coup d'état attempt and also lobbied the Parliament of Pakistan to carry out an unsuccessful motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.[117]The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait under Saddam Hussein on August 2, 1990, put the Saudi kingdom and the royal family at risk. With Iraqi forces on the Saudi border, Saddam's appeal to pan-Arabism was potentially inciting internal dissent. One week after King Fahd agreed to U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's offer of American military assistance, Bin Laden met with King Fahd and Saudi Defense Minister Sultan, telling them not to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the United States and others and offering to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legion. When Sultan asked how secondnameplaceholder would defend the fighters if Saddam used Iraqi chemical and biological weapons against them he replied "We will fight him with faith."[118] Bin Laden's offer was rebuffed, and the Saudi monarchy invited the deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi territory.[119]Bin Laden publicly denounced Saudi dependence on the U.S. Armed Forces, arguing that the Quran prohibited non-Muslims from setting foot in the Arabian Peninsula and that two holiest shrines of Islam, Mecca and Medina, the cities in which the Islamic prophet Muhammad received and recited Allah's message, should only be defended by Muslims. Bin Laden tried to convince the Saudi ulama to issue a fatwa condemning the American military deployment but senior clerics refused out of fear of repression.[120] Bin Laden's criticism of the Saudi monarchy led them to try to silence him. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed in the north-eastern Saudi city of Dhahran and was deployed in the desert barely 400 miles from Medina.[12]Meanwhile, on November 8, 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of El Sayyid Nosair, an associate of al-Qaeda operative Ali Mohamed. They discovered copious evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers. This marked the earliest discovery of al-Qaeda terrorist plans outside of Muslim countries.[121] Nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and later admitted guilt for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City on November 5, 1990.In 1991, secondnameplaceholder was expelled from Saudi Arabia by its regime after repeatedly criticizing the Saudi alliance with the United States.[114][122] He and his followers moved first to Afghanistan and then relocated to Sudan by 1992,[114][122] in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed.[123] Bin Laden's personal security detail consisted of bodyguards personally selected by him. Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-47s, RPGs, and PK machine guns.[124] Meanwhile, in March–April 1992, secondnameplaceholder tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating civil war in Afghanistan, by urging warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to join the other mujahideen leaders negotiating a coalition government instead of trying to conquer Kabul for himself.[125]U.S. intelligence monitored secondnameplaceholder in Sudan using operatives to run by daily and to photograph activities at his compound, and using an intelligence safe house and signals intelligence to surveil him and to record his moves.[126]In Sudan, secondnameplaceholder established a new base for Mujahideen operations in Khartoum. He bought a house on Al-Mashtal Street in the affluent Al-Riyadh quarter and a retreat at Soba on the Blue Nile.[127][128] During his time in Sudan, he heavily invested in the infrastructure, in agriculture and businesses. He was the Sudan agent for the British firm Hunting Surveys,[129] and built roads using the same bulldozers he had employed to construct mountain tracks in Afghanistan. Many of his labourers were the same fighters who had been his comrades in the war against the Soviet Union. He was generous to the poor and popular with the people.[130][131] He continued to criticize King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. In response, in 1994 Fahd stripped secondnameplaceholder of his Saudi citizenship and persuaded his family to cut off his $7 million a year stipend.[132][133]By that time, secondnameplaceholder was being linked with Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995 the EIJ attempted to assassinate the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The attempt failed, and Sudan expelled the EIJ.The U.S. State Department accused Sudan of being a sponsor of international terrorism and secondnameplaceholder of operating terrorist training camps in the Sudanese desert. However, according to Sudan officials, this stance became obsolete as the Islamist political leader Hassan al-Turabi lost influence in their country. The Sudanese wanted to engage with the U.S. but American officials refused to meet with them even after they had expelled secondnameplaceholder. It was not until 2000 that the State Department authorized U.S. intelligence officials to visit Sudan.[129]The 9/11 Commission Report states:The 9/11 Commission Report further states:Due to the increasing pressure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States, secondnameplaceholder was permitted to leave for a country of his choice. He chose to return to Jalalabad, Afghanistan aboard a chartered flight on May 18, 1996; there he forged a close relationship with Mullah Mohammed Omar.[136][137] According to the 9/11 Commission, the expulsion from Sudan significantly weakened secondnameplaceholder and his organization.[138] Some African intelligence sources have argued that the expulsion left secondnameplaceholder without an option other than becoming a full-time radical, and that most of the 300 Afghan Arabs who left with him subsequently became terrorists.[129] Various sources report that secondnameplaceholder lost between $20 million[139] and $300 million[140] in Sudan; the government seized his construction equipment, and secondnameplaceholder was forced to liquidate his businesses, land, and even his horses.In August 1996, secondnameplaceholder declared war against the United States.[141] Despite the assurance of President George H. W. Bush to King Fahd in 1990, that all U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there. Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy). Bin Laden's view was that "the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American colony".[14]In 1998 he issued a fatwā against the United States, which was first published in Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a London-based newspaper. It was entitled "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places".[142] Saudi Arabia is sometimes called "The Land of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest places in Islam. The reference to occupation in the fatwā referred to US forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch.In Afghanistan, secondnameplaceholder and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Soviet jihad, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters.[143] Bin Laden effectively took over Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of secondnameplaceholder's terrorist network.[144] The arms smuggler Viktor Bout helped to run the airline, maintaining planes and loading cargo. Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA's secondnameplaceholder unit, concluded that Ariana was being used as a terrorist taxi service.[145]It is believed that the first bombing attack involving secondnameplaceholder was the December 29, 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in Aden in which two people were killed.[114]After this bombing, al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper reward in death, going to Jannah (paradise) if they were good Muslims and to Jahannam (hell) if they were bad or non-believers.[146] The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public.In the 1990s, secondnameplaceholder's al-Qaeda assisted jihadis financially and sometimes militarily in Algeria, Egypt, and Afghanistan. In 1992 or 1993, secondnameplaceholder sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded. The war that followed caused the deaths of 150,000–200,000 Algerians and ended with the Islamist surrender to the government. In January 1996, the CIA launched a new unit of its Counterterrorism Center (CTC) called Bin Laden Issue Station, code-named "Alec Station", to track and to carry out operations against Bin Laden's activities. Bin Laden Issue Station was headed by Michael Scheuer, a veteran of the Islamic Extremism Branch of the CTC.[147]It has been claimed that secondnameplaceholder funded the Luxor massacre of November 17, 1997,[148][149][150] which killed 62 civilians, and outraged the Egyptian public. In mid-1997, the Northern Alliance threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing secondnameplaceholder to abandon his Najim Jihad compound and move his operations to Tarnak Farms in the south.[151]Another successful attack was carried out in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. Bin Laden helped cement his alliance with the Taliban by sending several hundred Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban kill between five and six thousand Hazaras overrunning the city.[152]In February 1998, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and Ayman al-Zawahiri co-signed a fatwa in the name of the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, which declared the killing of North Americans and their allies an "individual duty for every Muslim" to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) and the holy mosque (in Mecca) from their grip.[153][154] At the public announcement, fatwa secondnameplaceholder announced that North Americans are "very easy targets". He told the attending journalists, "You will see the results of this in a very short time."[155]Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998.[156] The 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings were a series of attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the United States embassies in the major East African cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.[157] The attacks were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the United States public for the first time. Al-Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the bombings.[157]In retaliation for the embassy bombings, President Bill Clinton ordered a series of cruise missile strikes on secondnameplaceholder-related targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on August 20, 1998.[157] In December 1998, the Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorist Center reported to President Clinton that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the United States of America, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft.[158] On June 7, 1999, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation placed secondnameplaceholder on its Ten Most Wanted list.[159]At the end of 2000, Richard Clarke revealed that Islamic militants headed by secondnameplaceholder had planned a triple attack on January 3, 2000, which would have included bombings in Jordan of the Radisson SAS Hotel in Amman, tourists at Mount Nebo, and a site on the Jordan River, as well as the sinking of the destroyer USS The Sullivans in Yemen, and an attack on a target within the United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to target the destroyer, and the arrest of Ahmed Ressam.[160]A former U.S. State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[161] In 1997, Rzeczpospolita, one of the largest Polish daily newspapers, had reported that intelligence services of the Nordic-Polish SFOR Brigade suspected that a center for training terrorists from Islamic countries was located in the Bocina Donja village near Maglaj in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1992, hundreds of volunteers joined an all-mujahedeen unit called El Moujahed in an abandoned hillside factory, a compound with a hospital and prayer hall.According to Middle East intelligence reports, secondnameplaceholder financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among them was Karim Said Atmani, who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the United States.[162] He is a former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, the man arrested at the Canada–United States border in mid-December 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials.[163][164] He was convicted of colluding with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder by a French court.[165]A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former Mujahideen who were linked to the same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists, and had lived in the area 100 km (60 mi) north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. Khalil al-Deek was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites. A second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. In its June 26, 1997, a report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, The New York Times noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslim forces. Further, the captured men also admitted to ties with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[166][167][verification needed]In 1999, the press reported that secondnameplaceholder and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and Bosnian passports in 1993 by the government in Sarajevo. The Bosnian government denied this information following the September 11 attacks, but it was later found that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that secondnameplaceholder did not personally collect his Bosnian passport and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who secondnameplaceholder was at the time.[166][167][verification needed]The Bosnian daily Oslobođenje published in 2001 that three men, believed to be linked to secondnameplaceholder, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports.[citation needed]SHISH's head Fatos Klosi said that firstnameplaceholder was running a terror network in Albania to take part in the Kosovo War under the guise of a humanitarian organisation and it was reported to have been started in 1994. Claude Kader, who was a member, testified its existence during his trial.[168] By 1998, four members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) were arrested in Albania and extradited to Egypt.[169] The mujahideen fighters were organised by Islamic leaders in Western Europe allied to him and Zawihiri.[170]During his trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević quoted from a purported FBI report that secondnameplaceholder's al-Qaeda had a presence in the Balkans and aided the Kosovo Liberation Army. He claimed secondnameplaceholder had used Albania as a launchpad for violence in the region and Europe. He claimed that they had informed Richard Holbrooke that KLA was being aided by al-Qaeda but the US decided to cooperate with the KLA and thus indirectly with firstnameplaceholder despite the 1998 United States embassy bombings earlier. Milošević had argued that the United States aided the terrorists, which culminated in its backing of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War.[171][172][173][174]After his initial denial,[176][177][178] in the wake of the attacks, secondnameplaceholder announced, "what the United States is tasting today is nothing compared to what we have tasted for decades. Our umma has known this humiliation and contempt for over eighty years. Its sons are killed, its blood is spilled, its holy sites are attacked, and it is not governed according to Allah's command. Despite this, no one cares".[179] In response to the attacks, the United States launched the War on Terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks. The CIA's Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing secondnameplaceholder.[180]
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that classified[181] evidence linking al-Qaeda and secondnameplaceholder to the September 11 attacks is clear and irrefutable.[182] The UK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding al-Qaeda and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's culpability for the September 11 attacks, although the government report noted that the evidence presented is not necessarily sufficient to prosecute the case.[183]Bin Laden initially denied involvement in the attacks. On September 16, 2001, secondnameplaceholder read a statement later broadcast by Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite channel denying responsibility for the attack.[184] In a videotape recovered by U.S. forces in November 2001 in Jalalabad, secondnameplaceholder was seen discussing the attack with Khaled al-Harbi in a way that indicates foreknowledge.[185] The tape was broadcast on various news networks on December 13, 2001. The merits of this translation have been disputed. Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini stated: "This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of secondnameplaceholder, it is not identical with the Arabic."[186]In the 2004 video, secondnameplaceholder abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it he said he had personally directed the nineteen hijackers.[187][188] In the 18-minute tape, played on Al-Jazeera, four days before the American presidential election, secondnameplaceholder accused U.S. President George W. Bush of negligence in the hijacking of the planes on September 11.[187] According to the tapes, secondnameplaceholder claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.[189]Through two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder announced, "I am the one in charge of the nineteen brothers. ... I was responsible for entrusting the nineteen brothers ... with the raids" (May 23, 2006).[190] In the tapes he was seen with Ramzi bin al-Shibh, as well as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Wail al-Shehri, as they made preparations for the attacks (videotape broadcast September 7, 2006).[191] Identified motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, presence of the U.S. military in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.
<h2>Criminal charges</h2>
On March 16, 1998, Libya issued the first official Interpol arrest warrant against secondnameplaceholder and three other people. They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, and his wife Vera in Libya on March 10, 1994.[81][192] Bin Laden was still wanted by the Libyan government at the time of his death.[193][194] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was first indicted by a grand jury of the United States on June 8, 1998 on a charges of conspiracy to attack defense utilities of the United States and prosecutors further charged that secondnameplaceholder was the head of the terrorist organization called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer of Islamic fighters worldwide.[195] On November 4, 1998, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on charges of Murder of U.S. Nationals Outside the United States, Conspiracy to Murder U.S. Nationals Outside the United States, and Attacks on a Federal Facility Resulting in Death[196] for his alleged role in the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The evidence against secondnameplaceholder included courtroom testimony by former al-Qaeda members and satellite phone records, from a phone purchased for him by al-Qaeda procurement agent Ziyad Khaleel in the United States.[197][198] However the Taliban ruled not to extradite Bin Laden on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence published in the indictments and that non-Muslim courts lacked standing to try Muslims.[199]Bin Laden became the 456th person listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, when he was added on June 7, 1999, following his indictment along with others for capital crimes in the 1998 embassy attacks. Attempts at assassination and requests for the extradition of secondnameplaceholder from the Taliban of Afghanistan were met with failure before the bombing of Afghanistan in October 2001.[200] In 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton convinced the United Nations to impose sanctions against Afghanistan in an attempt to force the Taliban to extradite him.[201]On October 10, 2001, secondnameplaceholder appeared as well on the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the President of the United States George W. Bush, in direct response to the September 11 attacks, but which was again based on the indictment for the 1998 embassy attack. Bin Laden was among a group of thirteen fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 embassy bombings. Bin Laden remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists.Despite the multiple indictments listed above and multiple requests, the Taliban refused to extradite firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. However, they did offer to try him before an Islamic court if evidence of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eight days after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder to a third-party country for trial in return for the United States ending the bombing. This offer was rejected by President Bush stating that this was no longer negotiable, with Bush responding "there's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty."[202]On June 15, 2011, federal prosecutors of the United States of America officially dropped all criminal charges against firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder following his death in May.[203]
<h2>Pursuit by the United States</h2>
Capturing firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder had been an objective of the United States government since the presidency of Bill Clinton.[204] Shortly after the September 11 attacks it was revealed that President Clinton had signed a directive authorizing the CIA (and specifically their elite Special Activities Division) to apprehend secondnameplaceholder and bring him to the United States to stand trial after the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Africa; if taking secondnameplaceholder alive was deemed impossible, then deadly force was authorized.[205] On August 20, 1998, 66 cruise missiles launched by United States Navy ships in the Arabian Sea struck secondnameplaceholder's training camps near Khost in Afghanistan, missing him by a few hours.[206] In 1999 the CIA, together with Pakistani military intelligence, had prepared a team of approximately 60 Pakistani commandos to infiltrate Afghanistan to capture or kill secondnameplaceholder, but the plan was aborted by the 1999 Pakistani coup d'état;[206] in 2000, foreign operatives working on behalf of the CIA had fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a convoy of vehicles in which secondnameplaceholder was traveling through the mountains of Afghanistan, hitting one of the vehicles but not the one in which secondnameplaceholder was riding.[205]In 2000, before the September 11 attacks, Paul Bremer characterized the Clinton administration as correctly focused on secondnameplaceholder, while Robert Oakley criticized their obsession with firstnameplaceholder.[160]Immediately after the September 11 attacks, U.S. government officials named secondnameplaceholder and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death.[28][207] On July 13, 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50 million, although the amount was never changed.[208] The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2 million reward.[209]According to The Washington Post, the U.S. government concluded that firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was present during the Battle of Tora Bora, Afghanistan in late 2001, and according to civilian and military officials with first-hand knowledge, failure by the United States to commit enough U.S. ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the United States in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials assembled what they believed to be decisive evidence, from contemporary and subsequent interrogations and intercepted communications, that secondnameplaceholder began the Battle of Tora Bora inside the cave complex along Afghanistan's mountainous eastern border.[210]The Washington Post also reported that the CIA unit composed of special operations paramilitary forces dedicated to capturing secondnameplaceholder was shut down in late 2005.[211]U.S. and Afghanistan forces raided the mountain caves in Tora Bora between August 14–16, 2007. The military was drawn to the area after receiving intelligence of a pre-Ramadan meeting held by al-Qaeda members. After killing dozens of al-Qaeda and Taliban members, they did not find either firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder or Ayman al-Zawahiri.[212]On October 7, 2008, in the second presidential debate, on foreign policy, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged, "We will kill secondnameplaceholder. We will crush al-Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority."[213] Upon being elected, then President-elect Obama expressed his plans to renew U.S. commitment to finding al-Qaeda leader firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, according to his national security advisers in an effort to ratchet up the hunt for the terrorist.[213] President Obama rejected the Bush administration's policy on secondnameplaceholder that conflated all terror threats from al-Qaeda to Hamas to Hezbollah, replacing it with a covert, laserlike focus on al-Qaeda and its spawn.[214][215]U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said in December 2009 that officials had had no reliable information on secondnameplaceholder's whereabouts for years. One week later, General Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said in December 2009 that al-Qaeda would not be defeated unless its leader, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, were captured or killed. Testifying to the U.S. Congress, he said that secondnameplaceholder had become an iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world, and that Obama's deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant that success would be possible. "I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed", McChrystal said of secondnameplaceholder. According to him, killing or capturing secondnameplaceholder would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not be eradicated while he remained at large.[216]In April 2011, President Obama ordered a covert operation to kill or capture secondnameplaceholder. On May 2, 2011, the White House announced that SEAL Team Six had successfully carried out the operation, killing him in his Abbottabad compound in Pakistan.[217]
<h2>Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 attacks</h2>
While referring to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in a CNN film clip on September 17, 2001, then-President George W. Bush stated, "I want justice. There is an old poster out west, as I recall, that said, 'Wanted: Dead or alive'".[218] Subsequently, secondnameplaceholder retreated further from public contact to avoid capture. Numerous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed secondnameplaceholder in different locations during overlapping time periods. None were ever definitively proven. After military offensives in Afghanistan failed to uncover his whereabouts, Pakistan was regularly identified as his suspected hiding place. Some of the conflicting reports regarding secondnameplaceholder's whereabouts and mistaken claims about his death follow:On March 29, 2012, Pakistani newspaper Dawn acquired a report produced by Pakistani security officials, based on interrogation of his three surviving wives, that detailed his movements while living underground in Pakistan.[233]In a 2010 letter, secondnameplaceholder chastised followers who had reinterpreted al-tatarrus—an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances—to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaeda, Bin Laden condemned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan for an attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants. Bin Laden wrote that the tatarrus doctrine needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established. He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a truce that would bring the country stability or would at least show the people that we are careful in keeping the Muslims safe on the basis of peace. In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised al-Shabab to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than entering into confrontations with Islamic political parties.[234]In April 2011, various U.S. intelligence outlets were able to pinpoint Bin Laden's suspected location near Abbottabad, Pakistan. It was previously believed that secondnameplaceholder was hiding near the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but he was found 160 km (100 mi) away in a three-story windowless mansion in Abbottabad at 34°10′9.51″N 73°14′32.78″E﻿ / ﻿34.1693083°N 73.2424389°E﻿ / 34.1693083; 73.2424389.[235][236][237] Bin Laden's mansion was located 1.3 km (0.8 mi) southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy.[238][239][240][241] Google Earth maps show that the compound was not present in 2001, but it was present in images taken in 2005.[242]
<h2>Death and aftermath</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, 2011, shortly after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM eastern time)[note 1][243][244] by a United States military special operations unit.The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation by a team of United States Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command,[245] with support from CIA operatives on the ground.[246][247] The raid on secondnameplaceholder's compound in Abbottabad was launched from Afghanistan.[248] After the raid, reports at the time stated that U.S. forces had taken secondnameplaceholder's body to Afghanistan for positive identification, then buried it at sea, in accordance with Islamic law, within 24 hours of his death.[249] Subsequent reporting has called this account into question—citing, for example, the absence of evidence that there was an imam on board the USS Carl Vinson, where the burial was said to have taken place.[250]Pakistani authorities later demolished the compound in February 2012[251] to prevent it from becoming a neo-Islamist shrine.[252][253][254][255][256][257][excessive citations] In February 2013, Pakistan announced plans to build a ₨265 million PKR ($30 million USD) amusement park in the area, including the property of the former hideout.[258]In an interview in 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan claimed that Pakistani intelligence led the CIA to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[259][260][261][262][263][264][265]Bin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were probably built for him,[266] and had reportedly been his home for at least five years.[267][268] The compound was located less than a mile from Pakistan Military Academy and less than 100 kilometers' drive from Pakistan's capital.[246][269] While the United States and Pakistan governments both claimed, and later maintained, that no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew secondnameplaceholder's whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the U.S. strike,[270][271] Carlotta Gall, writing in The New York Times Magazine in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knew of secondnameplaceholder's presence in Abbottabad.[272] In a 2015 London Review of Books article, investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh asserted—citing U.S. sources—that secondnameplaceholder had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Pasha knew of the U.S. mission in advance, and authorized the helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; and that the CIA learned of secondnameplaceholder's whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer, who was paid an estimated $25 million for the information.[250] Both stories were denied by U.S. and Pakistani officials.Mosharraf Zia, a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, "It seems deeply improbable that secondnameplaceholder could have been where he was killed without the knowledge of some parts of the Pakistani state."[273] Pakistan's United States envoy, Ambassador Husain Haqqani, promised a "full inquiry" into how Pakistani intelligence services could have failed to find secondnameplaceholder in a fortified compound so close to Islamabad. "Obviously secondnameplaceholder did have a support system", he said. "The issue is, was that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan, or within the society of Pakistan?"[274]Others argued that secondnameplaceholder lived in the compound with a local family, and never used the internet or a mobile phone, which would have made him much easier to locate.[275] Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari denied that his country's security forces sheltered secondnameplaceholder, and called any supposed support for secondnameplaceholder by the Pakistani government baseless speculation.[276][277] Government officials said that the country's limited resources had been committed to its war against the Pakistan Taliban, and other insurgents who posed an active threat to it, rather than to finding or sheltering secondnameplaceholder.[278]
(!!)Article(!/!)
firstnameplaceholder Emilio secondnameplaceholder Gaviria (/ˈɛskəbɑːr/; 1 December 1949 – 2 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord and narcoterrorist who was the founder and sole leader of the Medellín Cartel. Dubbed "The King of Cocaine," secondnameplaceholder is the wealthiest criminal in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by the time of his death—equivalent to $64 billion as of 2021—while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s.[1][2]Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, secondnameplaceholder studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín, but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom.In 1976, secondnameplaceholder founded the Medellín Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling routes into the United States. secondnameplaceholder's infiltration into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine and by the 1980s it was estimated secondnameplaceholder led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons of cocaine into the country from Colombia. As a result, he quickly became one of the richest people in the world,[3][4] but consistently battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians,[5] making Colombia the murder capital of the world.[6]In the 1982 Colombian parliamentary election secondnameplaceholder was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as part of the Liberal Alternative movement. Through this, he was responsible for community projects such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. However, secondnameplaceholder was vilified by the Colombian and U.S. governments,[7] who routinely stifled his political ambitions and pushed for his arrest, with secondnameplaceholder widely believed to have orchestrated the DAS Building and Avianca Flight 203 bombings in retaliation.In 1991, secondnameplaceholder surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on a host of charges, but struck a deal of no extradition with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, with the ability of being housed in his own, self-built prison, La Catedral. In 1992, secondnameplaceholder escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nation-wide manhunt.[8] As a result, the Medellín Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, secondnameplaceholder was killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police, a day after his 44th birthday.[9]secondnameplaceholder's legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, he was seen as a "Robin Hood-like" figure for many in Colombia, as he provided many amenities to the poor. His killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people.[10] Additionally, his private estate, Hacienda Nápoles, has been transformed into a theme park.[11] His life has also served as inspiration for or has been dramatized widely in film, television, and in music.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder Emilio secondnameplaceholder Gaviria was born on 1 December 1949, in Rionegro, in the Antioquia Department of Colombia. He was the third of seven children of the farmer Abel de Jesús Dari secondnameplaceholder Echeverri (1910–2001),[12] with his wife Hermilda de Los Dolores Gaviria Berrío (d. 2006),[13] an elementary school teacher.[14]Raised in the nearby city of Medellín, secondnameplaceholder is thought to have begun his criminal career as a teenager, allegedly stealing gravestones and sanding them down for resale to local smugglers. His brother, Roberto secondnameplaceholder, denies this, instead claiming that the gravestones came from cemetery owners whose clients had stopped paying for site care and that he had a relative who had a monuments business.[15] secondnameplaceholder's son, Sebastián Marroquín, claims his father's foray into crime began with a successful practice of selling counterfeit high school diplomas,[4] generally counterfeiting those awarded by the Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín. secondnameplaceholder studied at the university for a short period, but left without obtaining a degree.[16]secondnameplaceholder eventually became involved in many criminal activities with Oscar Benel Aguirre, with the duo running petty street scams, selling contraband cigarettes, fake lottery tickets, and stealing cars.[17] In the early 1970s, prior to entering the drug trade, secondnameplaceholder acted as a thief and bodyguard, allegedly earning US$100,000 by kidnapping and holding a Medellín executive for ransom.[18] secondnameplaceholder began working for Alvaro Prieto, a contraband smuggler who operated around Medellín, aiming to fulfill a childhood ambition to have COL $1 million by the time he was 22.[19] He is known to have had a bank deposit of COL 100 million (more than US$3 million), when he turned 26.[20]
<h2>Criminal career</h2>
In The Accountant's Story, Roberto secondnameplaceholder discusses how firstnameplaceholder rose from middle-class simplicity and obscurity to one of the world's wealthiest men. Beginning in 1975, firstnameplaceholder started developing his cocaine operation, flying out planes several times, mainly between Colombia and Panama, along smuggling routes into the United States. When he later bought fifteen bigger airplanes, including a Learjet and six helicopters, a close friend of firstnameplaceholder's died during the landing of an airplane along with the plane being destroyed, according to his son. firstnameplaceholder reconstructed the airplane from the scrap parts that were left and later hung it above the gate to his ranch at Hacienda Nápoles.In May 1976, secondnameplaceholder and several of his men were arrested and found in possession of 18 kilograms (39 lb) of white paste, attempting to return to Medellín with a heavy load from Ecuador. Initially, firstnameplaceholder tried to bribe the Medellín judges who were forming a case against him and was unsuccessful. After many months of legal wrangling, he ordered the murder of the two arresting officers, and the case was later dropped. Roberto secondnameplaceholder details this as the point where firstnameplaceholder began his pattern of dealing with the authorities through either bribery or murder.[21]Soon, the demand for cocaine greatly increased in the United States, which led to secondnameplaceholder organizing more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in South Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the country. He and cartel co-founder Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new trans-shipment point in the Bahamas, an island called Norman's Cay about 350 km (220 mi) southeast of the Florida coast. According to his brother, secondnameplaceholder did not purchase Norman's Cay; it was instead a sole venture of Lehder's. secondnameplaceholder and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a 1-kilometre (3,300 ft) airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine. From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medellín Cartel. With the enormous profits generated by this route, secondnameplaceholder was soon able to purchase 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi) of land in Antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the Hacienda Nápoles. The luxury house he created contained a zoo, a lake, a sculpture garden, a private bullring, and other diversions for his family and the cartel.[22]In 1982 secondnameplaceholder was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia, as part of a small movement called Liberal Alternative. Earlier in the campaign he was a candidate for the Liberal Renewal Movement, but had to leave it because of the firm opposition of Luis Carlos Galán, whose presidential campaign was supported by the Liberal Renewal Movement.[23][24] secondnameplaceholder was the official representative of the Colombian government for the swearing-in of Felipe González in Spain.[25]secondnameplaceholder quickly became known internationally as his drug network gained notoriety; the Medellín Cartel controlled a large portion of the drugs that entered the United States (including Puerto Rico), Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Spain. The production process was also altered, with coca from Bolivia and Peru replacing the coca from Colombia, which was beginning to be seen as substandard quality than the coca from the neighboring countries. As demand for more and better cocaine increased, secondnameplaceholder began working with Roberto Suárez Goméz, helping to further the product to other countries in the Americas and Europe, as well as being rumored to reach as far as Asia.It is alleged that secondnameplaceholder backed the 1985 storming of the Colombian Supreme Court by left-wing guerrillas from the 19th of April Movement, also known as M-19. The siege, a retaliation motivated by the Supreme Court studying the constitutionality of Colombia's extradition treaty with the U.S., resulted in the murders of half the judges on the court.[26] M-19 were paid to break into the Palace and burn all papers and files on Los Extraditables, a group of cocaine smugglers who were under threat of being extradited to the U.S. by the Colombian government. secondnameplaceholder was listed as a part of Los Extraditables. Hostages were also taken for negotiation of their release, thus helping to prevent the extradition of Los Extraditables to the U.S. for their crimes.[27]During the height of its operations, the Medellín Cartel brought in more than US$70 million per day (~$149.5 million in 2021 money). This level of income is roughly $26 billion per annum ($55.5 billion in 2021 money). Smuggling 15 tons of cocaine per day (worth more than half a billion dollars) into the United States, the cartel spent over US$1,000 per week purchasing rubber bands to wrap the stacks of cash they received, storing most of it in their warehouses. Ten percent of the cash had to be written off per year because of "spoilage" due to rats creeping in and nibbling on the bills they could reach.[19]When questioned about the essence of the cocaine business, secondnameplaceholder replied with "[the business is] simple: you bribe someone here, you bribe someone there, and you pay a friendly banker to help you bring the money back."[28] In 1989, Forbes magazine estimated secondnameplaceholder to be one of 227 billionaires in the world, asserting that he had a personal net worth of approaching US$3 billion (~$6.4 billion in 2021 money),[29] while his Medellín Cartel controlled 80% of the global cocaine market.[30] It is commonly believed that secondnameplaceholder was the principal financier behind Medellín's Atlético Nacional, which won South America's most prestigious football tournament, the Copa Libertadores, in 1989.[31]While seen as an enemy of the United States and Colombian governments, secondnameplaceholder was a hero to many in Medellín, especially to the poor. He was a natural at public relations, and he worked to create goodwill among the poor of Colombia. A lifelong sports fan, he was credited with building football fields and multi-sports courts, as well as sponsoring children's football teams.[19] secondnameplaceholder was also responsible for the construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the poor.[32][33][25] He worked hard to cultivate his Robin Hood image and frequently distributed money through housing projects and other civic activities, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. Some people from Medellín often helped secondnameplaceholder avoid police capture by serving as lookouts, hiding information from authorities, or doing whatever else they could to protect him. At the height of his power, drug traffickers from Medellín and other areas were handing over between 20% and 35% of their Colombian cocaine-related profits to secondnameplaceholder, as he was the one who shipped the cocaine successfully to the United States.[citation needed]The Colombian cartels' continuing struggles to maintain supremacy resulted in Colombia quickly becoming the world's murder capital, with 25,100 violent deaths in 1991 and 27,100 in 1992.[34] This increased murder rate was fueled by secondnameplaceholder giving money to his hitmen as a reward for killing police officers, over 600 of whom died as a result.[7]After the assassination of Luis Carlos Galán, the administration of César Gaviria moved against secondnameplaceholder and the drug cartels. Eventually, the government negotiated with secondnameplaceholder and convinced him to surrender and cease all criminal activity in exchange for a reduced sentence and preferential treatment during his captivity. Declaring an end to a series of previous violent acts meant to pressure authorities and public opinion, secondnameplaceholder surrendered to Colombian authorities in 1991. Before he gave himself up, the extradition of Colombian citizens to the United States had been prohibited by the newly approved Colombian Constitution of 1991. This act was controversial, as it was suspected that secondnameplaceholder and other drug lords had influenced members of the Constituent Assembly in passing the law. secondnameplaceholder was confined in what became his own luxurious private prison, La Catedral, which featured a football pitch, a giant dollhouse, a bar, a Jacuzzi, and a waterfall. Accounts of secondnameplaceholder's continued criminal activities while in prison began to surface in the media, which prompted the government to attempt to move him to a more conventional jail on 22 July 1992. secondnameplaceholder's influence allowed him to discover the plan in advance and make a successful escape, spending the remainder of his life evading the police.[35][36]Following secondnameplaceholder's escape, the United States Joint Special Operations Command (consisting of members of DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six) and Delta Force) and Centra Spike joined the manhunt for secondnameplaceholder. They trained and advised a special Colombian police task force known as the Search Bloc, which had been created to locate secondnameplaceholder. Later, as the conflict between secondnameplaceholder and the governments of the United States and Colombia dragged on, and as the numbers of secondnameplaceholder's enemies grew, a vigilante group known as Los Pepes (Los Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar, "People Persecuted by firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder") was formed. The group was financed by his rivals and former associates, including the Cali Cartel and right-wing paramilitaries led by Carlos Castaño, who would later fund the Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Córdoba and Urabá. Los Pepes carried out a bloody campaign, fueled by vengeance, in which more than 300 of secondnameplaceholder's associates, his lawyer[37] and relatives were killed, and a large amount of the Medellín cartel's property was destroyed.Members of the Search Bloc as well as Colombian and United States intelligence agencies either colluded with Los Pepes or moonlighted as both the Search Bloc and Los Pepes simultaneously in their efforts to find secondnameplaceholder. This coordination was allegedly conducted mainly through the sharing of intelligence to allow Los Pepes to bring down secondnameplaceholder and his few remaining allies, but there are reports that some individual Search Bloc members directly participated in missions of Los Pepes death squads.[33][page needed] One of the leaders of Los Pepes was Diego Murillo Bejarano (also known as "Don Berna"), a former Medellín Cartel associate who became a rival drug kingpin and eventually emerged as a leader of one of the most powerful factions within the Self-Defence of Colombia.
<h2>Personal life</h2>
In March 1976, the 26-year-old secondnameplaceholder married María Victoria Henao, who was 15. The relationship was discouraged by the Henao family, who considered secondnameplaceholder socially inferior; the pair eloped.[20] They had two children: Juan firstnameplaceholder (now Sebastián Marroquín) and Manuela.In 2007, the journalist Virginia Vallejo published her memoir Amando a firstnameplaceholder, odiando a secondnameplaceholder (Loving firstnameplaceholder, Hating secondnameplaceholder), in which she describes her romantic relationship with secondnameplaceholder and the links of her lover with several presidents, Caribbean dictators, and high-profile politicians.[38] Her book inspired the movie Loving firstnameplaceholder (2017).[39]A drug distributor, Griselda Blanco, is also reported to have conducted a clandestine, but passionate, relationship with secondnameplaceholder; several items in her diary link him with the nicknames "Coque de Mi Rey" (My Coke King) and "Polla Blanca" (White Cock).[40]After becoming wealthy, secondnameplaceholder created or bought numerous residences and safe houses, with the Hacienda Nápoles gaining significant notoriety. The luxury house contained a colonial house, a sculpture park, and a complete zoo with animals from various continents, including elephants, exotic birds, giraffes, and hippopotamuses. secondnameplaceholder had also planned to construct a Greek-style citadel near it, and though construction of the citadel was started, it was never finished.[41]secondnameplaceholder also owned a home in the US under his own name: a 6,500 square foot (604 m2), pink, waterfront mansion situated at 5860 North Bay Road in Miami Beach, Florida. The four-bedroom estate, built in 1948 on Biscayne Bay, was seized by the US federal government in the 1980s. Later, the dilapidated property was owned by Christian de Berdouare, proprietor of the Chicken Kitchen fast-food chain, who had bought it in 2014. De Berdouare would later hire a documentary film crew and professional treasure hunters to search the edifice before and after demolition, for anything related to secondnameplaceholder or his cartel. They would find unusual holes in floors and walls, as well as a safe that was stolen from its hole in the marble flooring before it could be properly examined.[42]secondnameplaceholder also owned a huge Caribbean getaway on Isla Grande, the largest of the cluster of the 27 coral cluster islands comprising Islas del Rosario, located about 35 km (22 mi) from Cartagena. The compound, now half-demolished and overtaken by vegetation and wild animals, featured a mansion, apartments, courtyards, a large swimming pool, a helicopter landing pad, reinforced windows, tiled floors, and a large but unfinished building to the side of the mansion.[43]
<h2>Death</h2>
Sixteen months after his escape from La Catedral, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder died in a shootout on 2 December 1993, amid another of his attempts to elude the Search Bloc.[44] A Colombian electronic surveillance team, led by Brigadier Hugo Martínez,[45] used radio trilateration technology to track his cell phone transmissions and found him hiding in Los Olivos, a middle-class barrio in Medellín. The search bloc of 8 men raided the House by blowing the door open and pursuing him as he ran to the roof and tried to escape them, as well as engaging in a firefight with secondnameplaceholder and his bodyguard, Álvaro de Jesús Agudelo (alias "El Limón") which ensued. The two fugitives attempted to escape by running across the roofs of adjoining houses to reach a back street, but both were shot and killed by Colombian National Police.[9] secondnameplaceholder suffered gunshots to the leg and torso, and a fatal gunshot through the ear.It has never been proven who actually fired the final shot into his ear, nor has it been determined whether this shot was made during the gunfight or as part of a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the subject. Some of secondnameplaceholder's relatives believe that he committed suicide.[8][46] His two brothers, Roberto secondnameplaceholder and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear. In a statement regarding the topic, the duo stated that firstnameplaceholder "had committed suicide, he did not get killed. During all the years they went after him, he would say to me every day that if he was really cornered without a way out, he would 'shoot himself through the ear'."[47][page needed]
<h2>Aftermath of his death</h2>
Soon after secondnameplaceholder's death and the subsequent fragmentation of the Medellín Cartel, the cocaine market became dominated by the rival Cali Cartel until the mid-1990s when its leaders were either killed or captured by the Colombian government. The Robin Hood image that secondnameplaceholder had cultivated maintained a lasting influence in Medellín. Many there, especially many of the city's poor whom secondnameplaceholder had aided while he was alive, mourned his death, and over 25,000 people attended his funeral. Some of them consider him a saint and pray to him for receiving divine help.[48]On 4 July 2006, Virginia Vallejo, a television anchorwoman romantically involved with secondnameplaceholder from 1983 to 1987, offered Attorney General Mario Iguarán her testimony in the trial against former Senator Alberto Santofimio, who was accused of conspiracy in the 1989 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán. Iguarán acknowledged that, although Vallejo had contacted his office on 4 July, the judge had decided to close the trial on 9 July, several weeks before the prospective closing date. The action was seen as too late.[49][50]On 18 July 2006, Vallejo was taken to the United States on a special flight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), for "safety and security reasons" due to her cooperation in high-profile criminal cases.[51][52] On 24 July, a video in which Vallejo had accused Santofimio of instigating secondnameplaceholder to eliminate presidential candidate Galán was aired by RCN Television of Colombia. The video was seen by 14 million people, and was instrumental for the reopened case of Galán's assassination. On 31 August 2011 Santofimio was sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the crime.[53][54]Among secondnameplaceholder's biographers, only Vallejo has given a detailed explanation of his role in the 1985 Palace of Justice siege. The journalist stated that secondnameplaceholder had financed the operation, which was committed by M-19; but she blamed the army for the killings of more than 100 people, including 11 Supreme Court magistrates, M-19 members, and employees of the cafeteria. Her statements prompted the reopening of the case in 2008; Vallejo was asked to testify, and many of the events she had described in her book and testimonial were confirmed by Colombia's Commission of Truth.[55][56] These events led to further investigation into the siege that resulted with the conviction of a high-ranking former colonel and a former general, later sentenced to 30 and 35 years in prison, respectively, for the forced disappearance of the detained after the siege.[57][58] Vallejo would subsequently testify in Galán's assassination.[59] In her book, Amando a firstnameplaceholder, odiando a secondnameplaceholder (Loving firstnameplaceholder, Hating secondnameplaceholder), she had accused several politicians, including Colombian presidents Alfonso López Michelsen, Ernesto Samper and Álvaro Uribe of having links to drug cartels.[60] Due to threats, and her cooperation in these cases, on 3 June 2010 the United States granted political asylum to the Colombian journalist.secondnameplaceholder's widow (María Henao, now María Isabel Santos Caballero), son (Juan firstnameplaceholder, now Juan Sebastián Marroquín Santos) and daughter (Manuela) fled Colombia in 1995 after failing to find a country that would grant them asylum.[61] Despite secondnameplaceholder's numerous and continual infidelities, Maria remained supportive of her husband. Members of the Cali Cartel even replayed their recordings of her conversations with firstnameplaceholder for their wives to demonstrate how a woman should behave.[62] This attitude proved to be the reason the cartel did not kill her and her children after firstnameplaceholder's death, although the group demanded (and received) millions of dollars in reparations for secondnameplaceholder's war against them. Henao even successfully negotiated for her son's life by personally guaranteeing he would not seek revenge against the cartel or participate in the drug trade.[63]After escaping first to Mozambique, then to Brazil, the family settled in Argentina.[64] Living under her assumed name, Henao became a successful real estate entrepreneur until one of her business associates discovered her true identity, and Henao absconded with her earnings. Local media were alerted, and after being exposed as secondnameplaceholder's widow, Henao was imprisoned for eighteen months while her finances were investigated. Ultimately, authorities were unable to link her funds to illegal activity, and she was released.[65] According to her son, Henao fell in love with secondnameplaceholder "because of his naughty smile [and] the way he looked at [her]. [He] was affectionate and sweet. A great lover. I fell in love with his desire to help people and his compassion for their hardship. We [would] drive to places where he dreamed of building schools for the poor. From [the] beginning, he was always a gentleman."[66] María Victoria Henao de secondnameplaceholder, with her new identity as María Isabel Santos Caballero, continues to live in Buenos Aires with her son and daughter.[67] On 5 June 2018, the Argentine federal judge Nestor Barral accused her and her son, Sebastián Marroquín Santos, of money laundering with two Colombian drug traffickers.[68][69][70] The judge ordered the seizing of assets for about $1m each.[71]Argentinian filmmaker Nicolas Entel's documentary Sins of My Father (2009) chronicles Marroquín's efforts to seek forgiveness, on behalf of his father, from the sons of Rodrigo Lara, Colombia's justice minister who was assassinated in 1984, as well as from the sons of Luis Carlos Galán, the presidential candidate who was assassinated in 1989. The film was shown at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and premiered in the US on HBO in October 2010.[72] In 2014, Marroquín published firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, My Father under his birth name. The book provides a firsthand insight into details of his father's life and describes the fundamentally disintegrating effect of his death upon the family. Marroquín aimed to publish the book in hopes to resolve any inaccuracies regarding his father's excursions during the 1990s.[73]secondnameplaceholder's sister, Luz Maria secondnameplaceholder, also made multiple gestures in attempts to make amends for the drug baron's crimes. These include making public statements in the press, leaving letters on the graves of his victims and on the 20th anniversary of his death organizing a public memorial for his victims.[74] secondnameplaceholder's body was exhumed on 28 October 2006 at the request of some of his relatives in order to take a DNA sample to confirm the alleged paternity of an illegitimate child and remove all doubt about the identity of the body that had been buried next to his parents for 12 years.[75] A video of the exhumation was broadcast by RCN, angering Marroquín, who accused his uncle, Roberto secondnameplaceholder, and cousin, Nicolas secondnameplaceholder, of being "merchants of death" by allowing the video to air.[76]After secondnameplaceholder's death, the ranch, zoo and citadel at Hacienda Nápoles were given by the government to low-income families under a law called Extinción de Dominio (Domain Extinction). The property has been converted into a theme park surrounded by four luxury hotels overlooking the zoo.[41]In 2014, Roberto secondnameplaceholder founded secondnameplaceholder Inc with Olof K. Gustafsson and registered Successor-In-Interest rights for his brother firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder in California, United States.[77]secondnameplaceholder kept four hippos in a private menagerie at Hacienda Nápoles. They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after secondnameplaceholder's death, and hence left on the untended estate. By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River.[78][79] In 2009, two adults and one calf escaped the herd and, after attacking humans and killing cattle, one of the adults (called "Pepe") was killed by hunters under authorization of the local authorities.[79][80] As of early 2014, 40 hippos have been reported to exist in Puerto Triunfo, Antioquia, from the original four belonging to secondnameplaceholder.[81] Without management the population size is likely to more than double in the next decade.[82]The National Geographic Channel produced a documentary about them titled Cocaine Hippos.[83] A report published in a Yale student magazine noted that local environmentalists are campaigning to protect the animals, although there is no clear plan for what will happen to them.[84] In 2018, National Geographic published another article on the hippos which found disagreement among environmentalists on whether they were having a positive or negative impact, but that conservationists and locals – particularly those in the tourism industry – were mostly in support of their continued presence.[85]On 22 February 2019, at 11:53 AM local time, Medellín authorities demolished the six-story Edificio Mónaco apartment complex in the El Poblado neighborhood where, according to retired Colombian general Rosso José Serrano, secondnameplaceholder planned some of his most brazen attacks. The building was initially built for secondnameplaceholder's wife but was gutted by a Cali Cartel car bomb in 1988 and had remained unoccupied ever since, becoming an attraction to foreign tourists seeking out secondnameplaceholder's physical legacy. Mayor Federico Gutierrez had been pushing to raze the building and erect in its place a park honoring the thousands of cartel victims, including four presidential candidates and some 500 police officers. Colombian President Ivan Duque said the demolition "means that history is not going to be written in terms of the perpetrators but by recognizing the victims," hoping the demolition would showcase that the city had evolved significantly and had more to offer than the legacy left by the cartels.[86]
<h2>In popular culture</h2>
secondnameplaceholder has been the subject of several books, including the following:Two major feature films on secondnameplaceholder, secondnameplaceholder (2009) and Killing firstnameplaceholder (2011), were announced in 2007.[93] Details about them, and additional films about secondnameplaceholder, are listed below.

firstnameplaceholder Gabriel secondnameplaceholder (/mʊˈɡɑːbi/;[1] Shona: [muɡaɓe]; 21 February 1924 – 6 September 2019) was a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987 and then as President from 1987 to 2017. He served as Leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the ZANU – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an African nationalist, during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a Marxist–Leninist, and as a socialist after the 1990s.secondnameplaceholder was born to a poor Shona family in Kutama, Southern Rhodesia. Educated at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare, he worked as a schoolteacher in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Ghana. Angered by white minority rule of his homeland within the British Empire, secondnameplaceholder embraced Marxism and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of sedition and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to Mozambique, established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw its role in the Rhodesian Bush War, fighting Ian Smith's predominately white government. He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement, putting an end to the war. In the 1980 general election, secondnameplaceholder led ZANU-PF to victory, becoming Prime Minister when the country, now renamed Zimbabwe, gained internationally recognised independence later that year. secondnameplaceholder's administration expanded healthcare and education and—despite his professed desire for a socialist society—adhered largely to mainstream, conservative economic policies.secondnameplaceholder's calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing white emigration, while relations with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) also deteriorated. In the Gukurahundi of 1982–1987, secondnameplaceholder's Fifth Brigade crushed ZAPU-linked opposition in Matabeleland in a campaign that killed at least 10,000 people, mostly Ndebele civilians. Internationally he sent troops into the Second Congo War and chaired the Non-Aligned Movement (1986–89), the Organisation of African Unity (1997–98), and the African Union (2015–16). Pursuing decolonisation, secondnameplaceholder emphasised the redistribution of land controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a "willing seller–willing buyer" basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 he encouraged black Zimbabweans to violently seize white-owned farms. Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, economic decline, and Western sanctions. Opposition to secondnameplaceholder grew, but he was re-elected in 2002, 2008, and 2013 through campaigns dominated by violence, electoral fraud, and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base. In 2017, members of his party ousted him in a coup, replacing him with former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa.Having dominated Zimbabwe's politics for nearly four decades, secondnameplaceholder was a controversial figure. He was praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule. Critics accused secondnameplaceholder of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement and widespread corruption and human rights abuses, including anti-white racism and crimes against humanity.
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder Gabriel secondnameplaceholder was born on 21 February 1924 at the Kutama Mission village in Southern Rhodesia's Zvimba District.[2] His father, Gabriel Matibiri, was a carpenter while his mother Bona was a Christian catechist for the village children.[3] They had been trained in their professions by the Jesuits, the Roman Catholic religious order which had established the mission.[4] Bona and Gabriel had six children: Miteri (Michael), Raphael, firstnameplaceholder, Dhonandhe (Donald), Sabina, and Bridgette.[5] They belonged to the Zezuru clan, one of the smallest branches of the Shona tribe.[6] secondnameplaceholder's paternal grandfather was Chief Constantine Karigamombe, alias "Matibiri", a powerful figure who served King Lobengula in the 19th century.[7] Through his father, he claimed membership of the chieftaincy family that has provided the hereditary rulers of Zvimba for generations.[8]The Jesuits were strict disciplinarians and under their influence secondnameplaceholder developed an intense self-discipline,[4] while also becoming a devout Catholic.[9] secondnameplaceholder excelled at school,[10] where he was a secretive and solitary child,[11] preferring to read, rather than playing sports or socialising with other children.[12] He was taunted by many of the other children, who regarded him as a coward and a mother's boy.[13]In about 1930 Gabriel had an argument with one of the Jesuits, and as a result the secondnameplaceholder family was expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubière.[14] The family settled in a village about 11 kilometres (7 miles) away; the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home on weekends.[10] Around the same time, firstnameplaceholder's older brother Raphael died, likely of diarrhoea.[10] In early 1934, firstnameplaceholder's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize.[15] Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment in Bulawayo.[16] He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.[17]Loubière died shortly after and was replaced by an Irishman, Father Jerome O'Hea, who welcomed the return of the secondnameplaceholder family to Kutama.[10] In contrast to the racism that permeated Southern Rhodesian society, under O'Hea's leadership the Kutama Mission preached an ethos of racial equality.[18] O'Hea nurtured the young secondnameplaceholder; shortly before his death in 1970 he described the latter as having "an exceptional mind and an exceptional heart".[19] As well as helping provide secondnameplaceholder with a Christian education, O'Hea taught him about the Irish War of Independence, in which Irish revolutionaries had overthrown the British imperial regime.[20] After completing six years of elementary education, in 1941 secondnameplaceholder was offered a place on a teacher training course at Kutama College. secondnameplaceholder's mother could not afford the tuition fees, which were paid in part by his grandfather and in part by O'Hea.[21] As part of this education, secondnameplaceholder began teaching at his old school, earning £2 per month, which he used to support his family.[22] In 1944, Gabriel returned to Kutama with his three new children, but died shortly after, leaving firstnameplaceholder to take financial responsibility for both his three siblings and three half-siblings.[22]  Having attained a teaching diploma, secondnameplaceholder left Kutama in 1945.[23]During the following years, secondnameplaceholder taught at various schools around Southern Rhodesia,[24] among them the Dadaya Mission school in Shabani.[25] There is no evidence that secondnameplaceholder was involved in political activity at the time, and he did not participate in the country's 1948 general strike.[26] In 1949 he won a scholarship to study at the University of Fort Hare in South Africa's Eastern Cape.[27] There he joined the African National Congress youth league (ANCYL)[28] and attended African nationalist meetings, where he met a number of Jewish South African communists who introduced him to Marxist ideas.[29] He later related that despite this exposure to Marxism, his biggest influence at the time were the actions of Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement.[30] In 1952, he left the university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English literature.[31] In later years he described his time at Fort Hare as the "turning point" in his life.[32]secondnameplaceholder returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1952,[33] by which time—he later related— he was "completely hostile to the [colonialist] system".[34] Here, his first job was as a teacher at the Driefontein Roman Catholic Mission School near Umvuma.[28] In 1953 he relocated to the Highfield Government School in Salisbury's Harari township and in 1954 to the Mambo Township Government School in Gwelo.[35] Meanwhile, he gained a Bachelor of Education degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa,[36] and ordered a number of Marxist tracts—among them Karl Marx's Capital and Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England—from a London mail-order company.[37] Despite his growing interest in politics, he was not active in any political movement.[34] He joined a number of inter-racial groups, such as the Capricorn Africa Society, through which he mixed with both black and white Rhodesians.[38] Guy Clutton-Brock, who knew secondnameplaceholder through this group, later noted that he was "an extraordinary young man" who could be "a bit of a cold fish at times" but "could talk about Elvis Presley or Bing Crosby as easily as politics".[39]From 1955 to 1958, secondnameplaceholder lived in neighbouring Northern Rhodesia, where he worked at Chalimbana Teacher Training College in Lusaka.[36] There he continued his education by working on a second degree by correspondence, this time a Bachelor of Administration from the University of London International Programmes through distance and learning. [36] In Northern Rhodesia, he was taken in for a time by the family of Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom secondnameplaceholder inspired to join the liberation movement and who would later go on to be President of Zimbabwe.[40] In 1958, secondnameplaceholder moved to Ghana to work at St Mary's Teacher Training College in Takoradi.[41] He taught at Apowa Secondary School, also at Takoradi, after obtaining his local certification at Achimota College (1958–1960), where he met his first wife, Sally Hayfron.[42] According to secondnameplaceholder, "I went [to Ghana] as an adventurist. I wanted to see what it would be like in an independent African state".[43] Ghana had been the first African state to gain independence from European colonial powers and under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah underwent a range of African nationalist reforms; secondnameplaceholder revelled in this environment.[44] In tandem with his teaching, secondnameplaceholder attended the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute in Winneba.[45] secondnameplaceholder later claimed that it was in Ghana that he finally embraced Marxism.[46] He also began a relationship there with Hayfron who worked at the college and shared his political interests.[47]
<h2>Revolutionary activity</h2>
While secondnameplaceholder was teaching abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement was established in Southern Rhodesia. It was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959.[48] SRANC was replaced by the more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960.[49] In May 1960, secondnameplaceholder returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him.[50] The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however secondnameplaceholder's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.[51]In July 1960, Takawira and two other NDP officials were arrested; in protest, secondnameplaceholder joined a demonstration of 7,000 people who planned to march from Highfield to the Prime Minister's office in Salisbury. The demonstration was stopped by riot police outside Stoddart Hall in Harare township.[52] By midday the next day, the crowd had grown to 40,000 and a makeshift platform had been erected for speakers. Having become a much-respected figure through his profession, his possession of three degrees, and his travels abroad, secondnameplaceholder was among those invited to speak to the crowd.[53] Following this event, secondnameplaceholder decided to devote himself full-time to activism, resigning his teaching post in Ghana (after having served two years of the four-year teaching contract).[54] He chaired the first NDP congress, held in October 1960, assisted by Chitepo on the procedural aspects. secondnameplaceholder was elected the party's publicity secretary.[55] secondnameplaceholder consciously injected emotionalism into the NDP's African nationalism, hoping to broaden its support among the wider population by appealing to traditional cultural values.[56] He helped to form the NDP Youth Wing and encouraged the incorporation of ancestral prayers, traditional costume, and female ululation into its meetings.[57] In February 1961 he married Hayfron in a Roman Catholic ceremony conducted in Salisbury; she had converted to Catholicism to make this possible.[58]The British government held a Salisbury conference in 1961 to determine Southern Rhodesia's future. Nkomo led an NDP delegation, which hoped that the British would support the creation of an independent state governed by the black majority. Representatives of the country's white minority—who then controlled Southern Rhodesia's government—were opposed to this, promoting continued white minority rule.[59] Following negotiations, Nkomo agreed to a proposal which would allow the black population representation through 15 of the 65 seats in the country's parliament. secondnameplaceholder and others in the NDP were furious at Nkomo's compromise.[60] Following the conference, Southern Rhodesia's African nationalist movement fell into disarray.[61] secondnameplaceholder spoke at a number of NDP rallies before the party was banned by the government in December 1961.[62] Many of its members re-grouped as the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) several days later,[63] with secondnameplaceholder appointed as ZAPU's publicity secretary and general secretary.[64]Racial violence was growing in the country, with aggrieved black Africans targeting the white community.[65] secondnameplaceholder deemed such conflict a necessary tactic in the overthrow of British colonial dominance and white minority rule. This contrasted with Nkomo's view that African nationalists should focus on international diplomacy to encourage the British government to grant their demands.[65] Nine months after it had been founded, ZAPU was also banned by the government,[63] and in September 1962 secondnameplaceholder and other senior party officials were arrested and restricted to their home districts for three months.[63]  Both secondnameplaceholder and his wife were in trouble with the law; he had been charged with making subversive statements in a public speech and awarded bail before his trial.[66] Hayfron had been sentenced to two years imprisonment—suspended for 15 months—for a speech in which she declared that the British Queen Elizabeth II "can go to hell".[67]The rise of African nationalism generated a white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full independence from the United Kingdom.[69] secondnameplaceholder met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, it was time to move towards armed resistance.[70] Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in Dar es Salaam.[71] He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city.[72] There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed the idea of a government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.[73]In August, Hayfron gave birth to secondnameplaceholder's son, whom they named Nhamodzenyika, a Shona term meaning "suffering country".[74] secondnameplaceholder insisted that she take their son back to Ghana, while he decided to return to Southern Rhodesia.[75] There, African nationalists opposed to Nkomo's leadership had established a new party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), in August; Ndabaningi Sithole became the group's president, while appointing secondnameplaceholder to be the group's secretary-general in absentia.[76] Nkomo responded by forming his own group, the People's Caretaker Council, which was widely referred to as "ZAPU" after its predecessor.[77] ZAPU and ZANU violently opposed one another and soon gang warfare broke out between their rival memberships.[78][79]secondnameplaceholder was arrested on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963.[80] His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive statements that he had publicly made.[81] In March 1964 he was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment.[78] secondnameplaceholder was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que.[82] At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy, maths, and English.[83] Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from secondnameplaceholder and other members of the ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison.[84] At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in Lusaka. In April 1966 the group carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants.[85] The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including secondnameplaceholder, to Salisbury Prison in 1966.[86] There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the concrete floor due to overcrowding;[87] secondnameplaceholder shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere.[88] He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying.[88] During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.[89]While imprisoned, secondnameplaceholder learned that his son had died of encephalitis at the age of three. secondnameplaceholder was grief-stricken and requested a leave of absence to visit his wife in Ghana. He never forgave the prison authorities for refusing this request.[90] Claims have also circulated among those who knew him at the time that secondnameplaceholder was subjected to both physical and mental torture during his imprisonment.[91] According to Father Emmanuel Ribeiro, who was secondnameplaceholder's priest during his imprisonment, secondnameplaceholder got through the experience "partly through the strength of his spirituality" but also because his "real strength was study and helping others to learn".[92]While secondnameplaceholder was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now under the leadership of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement.[93] Smith's government made a unilateral declaration of independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country.[94]In 1972, the African nationalists launched a guerrilla war against Smith's government.[95] Among the revolutionaries, it was known as the "Second Chimurenga".[96] Paramilitary groups based themselves in neighbouring Tanzania and Zambia; many of their fighters were inadequately armed and trained.[97] ZANU's military wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), consisted largely of Shona. It was based in neighbouring Mozambique and gained funds from the People's Republic of China. ZAPU's military wing, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), was instead funded by the Soviet Union, was based in Zambia, and consisted largely of Ndebele.[98]secondnameplaceholder and other senior ZANU members had growing doubts about Sithole's leadership, deeming him increasingly irritable and irrational.[99] In October 1968 Sithole had tried to smuggle a message out of the prison commanding ZANU activists to assassinate Smith. His plan was discovered and he was put on trial in January 1969; desperate to avoid a death sentence, he declared that he renounced violence and his previous ideological commitments.[100] secondnameplaceholder denounced Sithole's "treachery" in rejecting ZANU's cause, and the executive removed him as ZANU President in a vote of no confidence, selecting secondnameplaceholder as his successor.[101] In November 1974, the ZANU executive voted to suspend Sithole's membership of the organisation.[102]Fearing that the guerrilla war would spread south, the South African government pressured Rhodesia to advance the process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained.[103] After almost eleven years of imprisonment, secondnameplaceholder was released in November 1974.[104] He moved in with his sister Sabina at her home in Highfield township.[105] He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war,[106] recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA.[107] This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominately between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.[108]In March 1975, secondnameplaceholder resolved to leave Rhodesia for Mozambique, ambitious to take control of ZANU's guerrilla campaign.[109] After his friend Maurice Nyagumbo was arrested, he feared the same fate but was hidden from the authorities by Ribeiro. Ribeiro and a sympathetic nun then assisted him and Edgar Tekere in smuggling themselves into Mozambique.[110] secondnameplaceholder remained in exile there for two years.[111] Mozambique's Marxist President Samora Machel was sceptical of secondnameplaceholder's leadership abilities and was unsure whether to recognise him as ZANU's legitimate leader. Machel gave him a house in Quelimane and kept him under partial house arrest, with secondnameplaceholder requiring permission to travel.[112] It would be almost a year before Machel accepted secondnameplaceholder's leadership of ZANU.[107]secondnameplaceholder travelled to various ZANLA camps in Mozambique to build support among its officers.[113] By mid-1976, he had secured the allegiance of ZANLA's military commanders and established himself as the most prominent guerrilla leader battling Smith's regime.[107] In August 1977, he was officially declared ZANU President at a meeting of the party's central committee held in Chimoio.[114] During the war, secondnameplaceholder remained suspicious of many of ZANLA's commanders and had a number of them imprisoned.[115] In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, Wilfred Mhanda, for suspected disloyalty.[115] After Josiah Tongogara was killed in a car accident in 1979, there were suggestions made that secondnameplaceholder may have had some involvement in it; these rumours were never substantiated.[116]secondnameplaceholder remained aloof from the day-to-day military operations of ZANLA, which he entrusted to Tongogara.[107] In January 1976, ZANLA launched its first major infiltration from Mozambique, with nearly 1000 guerrillas crossing the border to attack white-owned farms and stores.[117] In response, Smith's government enlisted all men under the age of 35, expanding the Rhodesian army by 50%.[117] ZANLA's attacks forced large numbers of white landowners to abandon their farms; their now-unemployed black workers joined ZANLA by the thousands.[118] By 1979, ZANLA were in a position to attack a number of Rhodesian cities.[119] Over the course of the war, at least 30,000 people were killed.[120] As a proportion of their wider population, the whites had higher number of fatalities,[120] and by the latter part of the decade the guerrillas were winning.[121]secondnameplaceholder focused on the propaganda war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts.[107] In these, he presented himself as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro.[115] Despite his Marxist views, secondnameplaceholder's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle.[122] His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions.[123] He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western embassies in Mozambique,[124] and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.[125]secondnameplaceholder called for the overthrow of Rhodesia's predominately white government, the execution of Smith and his "criminal gang", the expropriation of white-owned land, and the transformation of Rhodesia into a one-party Marxist state.[126] He repeatedly called for violence against the country's white minority,[127] referring to white Rhodesians as "blood-sucking exploiters", "sadistic killers", and "hard-core racists".[115] In one typical example, taken from a 1978 radio address, secondnameplaceholder declared: "Let us hammer [the white man] to defeat. Let us blow up his citadel. Let us give him no time to rest. Let us chase him in every corner. Let us rid our home of this settler vermin".[127] For secondnameplaceholder, armed struggle was an essential part of the establishment of a new state.[128] In contrast to other black nationalist leaders like Nkomo, secondnameplaceholder opposed a negotiated settlement with Smith's government.[128] In October 1976 ZANU nevertheless established a joint-platform with ZAPU known as the Patriotic Front.[129]
In September 1978 secondnameplaceholder met with Nkomo in Lusaka. He was angry with the latter's secret attempts to negotiate with Smith.[130]The beginning of the end for Smith came when South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster concluded that white minority rule was unsustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1.[131] Under pressure from Vorster, Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule could not be maintained forever. He oversaw the 1979 general election which resulted in Abel Muzorewa, a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister of the reconstituted Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition.[132] At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, held in Lusaka, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise the country's independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule.[133]The negotiations took place at Lancaster House in London and were led by the Conservative Party politician Peter Carington.[134] secondnameplaceholder refused to attend these London peace talks,[135] opposing the idea of a negotiated rather than military solution to the Rhodesian War.[136] Machel insisted that he must, threatening to end Mozambican support for the ZANU-PF if he did not.[137] secondnameplaceholder arrived in London in September 1979.[138] There, he and Nkomo presented themselves as part of the "Patriotic Front" but established separate headquarters in the city.[139] At the conference the pair were divided in their attitude; Nkomo wanted to present himself as a moderate while secondnameplaceholder played up to his image as a Marxist revolutionary, with Carington exploiting this division.[140] Throughout the negotiations, secondnameplaceholder did not trust the British and believed that they were manipulating events to their own advantage.[141]The ensuing Lancaster House Agreement called for all participants in the Rhodesian Bush War to agree to a ceasefire, with a British governor, Christopher Soames, arriving in Rhodesia to oversee an election in which the various factions could compete as political parties.[142] It outlined a plan for a transition to formal independence as a sovereign republic under black-majority rule, also maintaining that Rhodesia would be renamed Zimbabwe, a name adopted from the Iron Age archaeological site of Great Zimbabwe.[143] The agreement also ensured that the country's white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges,[144] with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in the new Parliament.[145] By insisting on the need for a democratic black majority government, Carington was able to convince secondnameplaceholder to compromise on the other main issue of the conference, that of land ownership.[146] secondnameplaceholder agreed to the protection of the white community's privately owned property on the condition that the UK and U.S  governments provide financial assistance allowing the Zimbabwean government to purchase much land for redistribution among blacks.[147] secondnameplaceholder was opposed to the idea of a ceasefire, but under pressure from Machel he agreed to it.[148] secondnameplaceholder signed the agreement, but felt cheated,[148] remaining disappointed that he had never achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces.[149]Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, secondnameplaceholder was greeted by a supportive crowd.[150] He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb.[151] Machel had cautioned secondnameplaceholder not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage as it had in Mozambique.[152] Accordingly, during his electoral campaign, secondnameplaceholder avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric.[153] secondnameplaceholder insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting.[154] He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF).[155] Predictions were made that ZANU–PF would win the election on the basis of the country's ethnic divisions; secondnameplaceholder was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%.[156] For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to secondnameplaceholder's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.[127]During the campaign, secondnameplaceholder survived two assassination attempts.[157] In the first, which took place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall.[157] In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. secondnameplaceholder himself was unharmed.[157] secondnameplaceholder accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks.[158] In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, secondnameplaceholder met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, and asked him to remain in his position in the event of a ZANU–PF victory. At the time Walls refused.[159]The electoral campaign was marred by widespread voter intimidation, perpetrated by Nkomo's ZAPU, Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council (UANC), and secondnameplaceholder's ZANU–PF.[160] Commenting on ZANU–PF's activities in eastern Rhodesia, Nkomo complained that "the word intimidation is mild. People are being terrorised. It is terror."[161] Reacting to ZANU–PF's acts of voter intimidation, secondnameplaceholder was called before Soames at Government House. secondnameplaceholder regarded the meeting as a British attempt to thwart his electoral campaign.[162] Under the terms of the negotiation, Soames had the power to disqualify any political party guilty of voter intimidation.[158] Rhodesia's security services, Nkomo, Muzorewa, and some of his own advisers all called on Soames to disqualify ZANU–PF. After deliberation, Soames disagreed, believing that ZANU–PF were sure to win the election and that disqualifying them would wreck any chance of an orderly transition of power.[158]In the February election, ZANU–PF secured 63% of the national vote, gaining 57 of the 80 parliamentary seats allocated for black parties and providing them with an absolute majority.[163] ZAPU had gained 20 seats, and UANC had three.[156] secondnameplaceholder was elected MP for the Salisbury constituency of Highfield.[164] Attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight, secondnameplaceholder appeared on television and called for national unity, stability, and law and order, insisting that the pensions of white civil servants would be guaranteed and that private property would be protected.[165]
<h2>Prime Minister of Zimbabwe: 1980–1987</h2>
Southern Rhodesia gained internationally recognised independence on 18 April 1980. secondnameplaceholder took the oath of office as the newly minted country's first Prime Minister shortly after midnight.[167][168] He gave a speech at Salisbury's Rufaro Stadium announcing that Rhodesia would be renamed "Zimbabwe" and pledged racial reconciliation.[169] Soames aided secondnameplaceholder in bringing about an orderly transition of power; for this secondnameplaceholder remained grateful, describing Soames as a good friend.[170] secondnameplaceholder unsuccessfully urged Soames to remain in Zimbabwe for several more years,[171] and also failed to convince the UK to assume a two-year "guiding role" for his government because most ZANU–PF members lacked experience in governing.[172] ZANU–PF's absolute parliamentary majority allowed them to rule alone, but secondnameplaceholder created a government of national unity by inviting members of rival parties to join his cabinet.[173] secondnameplaceholder moved into the Premier's residence in Salisbury, which he left furnished in the same style as Smith had left it.[174]Across the country, statues of Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after prominent colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists.[175] In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare.[176] secondnameplaceholder employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare to commemorate the struggle against minority rule.[177] Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule.[178] The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package.[178] The UK financed a land reform program,[179] and provided military advisers to aid the integration of the guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military.[180] Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army; though, there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups.[181] As Prime Minister, secondnameplaceholder retained Walls as the head of the armed forces.[182]secondnameplaceholder's government continued to make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, but did not take concrete steps in that direction.[183] In contrast to secondnameplaceholder's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment.[175] In office, secondnameplaceholder sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions.[170] From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew by an average of 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined.[184] The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990.[184] The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product.[184] Under secondnameplaceholder's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending.[184] In 1980, Zimbabwe had just 177 secondary schools, by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548.[184] During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the highest levels in Africa.[184] Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.[184]A new leadership elite were formed, who often expressed their newfound status through purchasing large houses and expensive cars, sending their children to private schools, and obtaining farms and businesses.[185] To contain their excesses, in 1984 secondnameplaceholder drew up a "leadership code" which prohibited any senior figures from obtaining more than one salary or owning over 50-acres of agricultural land.[185] There were exceptions, with secondnameplaceholder giving permission to General Solomon Mujuru to expand his business empire, resulting in him becoming one of the Zimbabwe's wealthiest people.[186] Growing corruption among the socio-economic elite generated resentment among the wider population, much of which was living in poverty.[187]ZANU–PF also began establishing its own business empire, founding the M&S Syndicate in 1980 and the Zidoo Holdings in 1981.[186] By 1992, the party had fixed assets and businesses worth an estimated Z$500 million (US$75 million).[186] In 1980, ZANU–PF used Nigerian funds to set up the Mass Media Trust, through which they bought out a South African company that owned most of Zimbabwe's newspapers.[188] The white editors of these newspapers were sacked and replaced by government appointees.[189] These media outlets subsequently became a source of the party's propaganda.[189]At independence, 39% of Zimbabwe's land was under the ownership of around 6000 white large-scale commercial farmers, while 4% was owned by black small-scale commercial farmers, and 41% was 'communal land' where 4 million people lived, often in overcrowded conditions.[190] The Lancaster House agreement ensured that until 1990, the sale of land could only take place on a "willing seller-willing buyer" basis. The only permitted exceptions were if the land was "underutilised" or needed for a public purpose, in which case the government could compulsorily purchase it while fully compensating the owner.[191] This meant that secondnameplaceholder's government was largely restricted to purchasing land which was of poor quality.[191] Its target was to resettle 18,000 black families on 2.5 million acres of white-owned land over three years. This would cost £30 million (US$60 million), half of which was to be provided by the UK government as per the Lancaster House Agreement.[190]In 1986, secondnameplaceholder became chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a position that he retained until 1989.[192] As the leader of one of the Front Line States, the countries bordering apartheid South Africa, he gained credibility within the anti-apartheid movement.[192]secondnameplaceholder initially emphasised racial reconciliation and he was keen to build a good relationship with white Zimbabweans.[194] He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property.[195] He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government,[196] met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce,[197] and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity.[198] With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved during the early years of secondnameplaceholder's rule.[199] In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.[179]Nevertheless, many white Zimbabweans complained that they were the victims of racial discrimination.[200] Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children would be unable to secure jobs.[179] There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 17,000 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated.[180] secondnameplaceholder's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, but did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations.[178] To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, secondnameplaceholder's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions.[178] In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-secondnameplaceholder militants among the country's white minority.[201]In December 1981, a bomb struck ZANU–PF headquarters, killing seven and injuring 124.[202] secondnameplaceholder blamed South African-backed white militants.[203] He criticised "reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements" in the white community, stating that despite the fact that they had faced no punishment for their past actions, they rejected racial reconciliation and "are acting in collusion with South Africa to harm our racial relations, to destroy our unity, to sabotage our economy, and to overthrow the popularly elected government I lead".[203] Increasingly he criticised not only the militants but the entire white community for holding a monopoly on "Zimbabwe's economic power".[204] This was a view echoed by many government ministers and the government-controlled media.[200] One of these ministers, Tekere, was involved in an incident in which he and seven armed men stormed a white-owned farmhouse, killing an elderly farmer; they alleged that in doing so they were foiling a coup attempt. Tekere was acquitted of murder; however, secondnameplaceholder dropped him from his cabinet.[205]Racial mistrust and suspicion continued to grow.[206] In December 1981, the elderly white MP Wally Stuttaford was accused of being a South African agent, arrested, and tortured, generating anger among whites.[207] In July 1982, South African-backed white militants destroyed 13 aircraft at Thornhill. A number of white military officers were accused of complicity, arrested, and tortured. They were put on trial but cleared by judges, after which they were immediately re-arrested.[208] Their case generated an international outcry, which secondnameplaceholder criticised, stating that the case only gained such attention because the accused were white.[209] His defence of torture and contempt for legal procedures damaged his international standing.[210] White flight continued to grow, and within three years of secondnameplaceholder's premiership half of all white Zimbabweans had emigrated.[211] In the 1985 election, Smith's Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe won 15 of the 20 seats allocated for white Zimbabweans.[212] secondnameplaceholder was outraged by this result,[213] lambasting white Zimbabweans for not repenting "in any way" by continuing to support Smith and other white politicians who had committed "horrors against the people of Zimbabwe".[212]Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a ceremonial role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana.[214] secondnameplaceholder had previously offered the position to Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs.[215] While working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between secondnameplaceholder and Nkomo.[216] secondnameplaceholder gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more.[217] In contrast, some ZANU–PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state.[218] Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant that there should be a crackdown on ZAPU.[218] After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city.[219]In January 1981, secondnameplaceholder demoted Nkomo in a cabinet reshuffle; the latter warned that this would anger ZAPU supporters.[220] In February, violence between ZAPU and ZANU–PF supporters broke out among the battalion stationed at Ntabazinduna, soon spreading to other army bases, resulting in 300 deaths.[221] An arms cache featuring land mines and anti-aircraft missiles were then discovered at Ascot Farm, which was part-owned by Nkomo. secondnameplaceholder cited this as evidence that ZAPU were plotting a coup, an allegation that Nkomo denied.[222] Likening Nkomo to "a cobra in the house", secondnameplaceholder sacked him from the government, and ZAPU-owned businesses, farms, and properties were seized.[223]Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA had deserted their positions and engaged in banditry.[218] In Matabeleland, ZIPRA deserters who came to be known as "dissenters" engaged in robbery, holding up buses, and attacking farm houses, creating an environment of growing lawlessness.[224] These dissidents received support from South Africa through its Operation Mute, by which it hoped to further destabilise Zimbabwe.[225] The government often conflated ZIPRA with the dissenters,[226] although Nkomo denounced the dissidents and their South African supporters.[227] secondnameplaceholder authorised the police and army to crack down on the Matabeleland dissenters, declaring that state officers would be granted legal immunity for any "extra-legal" actions they may perform while doing so.[227] During 1982 he had established the Fifth Brigade, an elite armed force trained by the North Koreans; membership was drawn largely from Shona-speaking ZANLA soldiers and were answerable directly to secondnameplaceholder.[228] In January 1983, the Fifth Brigade were deployed in the region, overseeing a campaign of beatings, arson, public executions, and massacres of those accused of being sympathetic to the dissidents.[229] The scale of the violence was greater than that witnessed in the Rhodesian War.[230] Interrogation centres were established where people were tortured.[231] secondnameplaceholder acknowledged that civilians would be persecuted in the violence, claiming that "we can't tell who is a dissident and who is not".[232] The ensuing events became known as the "Gukurahundi", a Shona word meaning "wind that sweeps away the chaff before the rains".[233]In 1984 the Gukurahundi spread to Matabeleland South, an area then in its third year of drought. The Fifth Brigade closed all stores, halted all deliveries, and imposed a curfew, exacerbating starvation for a period of two months.[234] The Bishop of Bulawayo accused secondnameplaceholder of overseeing a project of systematic starvation.[231] When a Roman Catholic delegation provided secondnameplaceholder with a dossier listing atrocities committed by the Fifth Brigade, secondnameplaceholder refuted all its allegations and accused the clergy of being disloyal to Zimbabwe.[235] He had the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe's suppressed.[236] In 1985, an Amnesty International report on the Gukurahundi was dismissed by secondnameplaceholder as "a heap of lies".[237] Over the course of four years, approximately 10,000 civilians had been killed, and many others had been beaten and tortured.[238] Genocide Watch later estimated that approximately 20,000 had been killed[239] and classified the events as genocide.[240]Margaret Thatcher's UK government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger secondnameplaceholder and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans.[241] The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming secondnameplaceholder to the White House in September 1983.[242] In October 1983, secondnameplaceholder attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi.[242] In 2000, secondnameplaceholder acknowledged that the mass killings had happened, stating that it was "an act of madness ... it was wrong and both sides were to blame".[243] His biographer Martin Meredith argued that secondnameplaceholder and his ZANU–PF were solely to blame for the massacres.[243] Various secondnameplaceholder biographers have seen the Gukurahundi as a deliberate attempt to eliminate ZAPU and its support base to advance his desire for a ZANU–PF one-party state.[244]There was further violence in the build-up to the 1985 election, with ZAPU supporters facing harassment from ZANU–PF Youth League brigades.[245] Despite this intimidation, ZAPU won all 15 of the parliamentary seats in Matabeleland.[245] secondnameplaceholder then appointed Enos Nkala as the new police minister. Nkala subsequently detained over 100 ZAPU officials, including five of its MPs and the Mayor of Bulawayo, banned the party from holding rallies or meetings, closed all of their offices, and dissolved all of the district councils that they controlled.[246] To avoid further violence, in December 1987 Nkomo signed a Unity Accord in which ZAPU was officially disbanded and its leadership merged into ZANU–PF.[247] The merger between the two parties left ZANU–PF with 99 of the 100 seats in parliament,[248] and established Zimbabwe as a de facto one-party state.[242]
<h2>President of Zimbabwe</h2>
In late 1987, Zimbabwe's parliament amended the constitution.[249] On 30 December it declared secondnameplaceholder to be executive President, a new position that combined the roles of head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[250] This position gave him the power to dissolve parliament, declare martial law, and run for an unlimited number of terms.[251] According to Meredith, secondnameplaceholder now had "a virtual stranglehold on government machinery and unlimited opportunities to exercise patronage".[251] The constitutional amendments also abolished the twenty parliamentary seats reserved for white representatives,[252] and left parliament less relevant and independent.[253]In the build-up to the 1990 election, parliamentary reforms increased the number of seats to 120; of these, twenty were to be appointed by the President and ten by the Council of Chiefs.[254] This measure made it more difficult for any opposition to secondnameplaceholder to gain a parliamentary majority.[255] The main opposition party in that election were the Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM), launched in April 1989 by Tekere;[256] although a longstanding friend of secondnameplaceholder, Tekere accused him of betraying the revolution and establishing a dictatorship.[257] ZANU–PF propaganda made threats against those considering voting ZUM in the election; one television advert featured images of a car crash with the statement "This is one way to die. Another is to vote ZUM. Don't commit suicide, vote ZANU-PF and live."[258] In the election, secondnameplaceholder was re-elected President with nearly 80% of the vote, while ZANU–PF secured 116 of the 119 available parliamentary seats.[259]secondnameplaceholder had long hoped to convert Zimbabwe into a one-party state, but in 1990 he officially "postponed" these plans as both Mozambique and many Eastern Bloc states transitioned from one-party states to multi-party republics.[260] Following the collapse of the Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, in 1991 ZANU–PF removed references to "Marxism-Leninism" and "scientific socialism" in its material; secondnameplaceholder maintained that "socialism remains our sworn ideology".[261] That year, secondnameplaceholder pledged himself to free market economics and accepted a structural adjustment programme provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[262] This economic reform package called for Zimbabwe to privatise state assets and reduce import tariffs;[184] secondnameplaceholder's government implemented some but not all of its recommendations.[262] The reforms encouraged employers to cut their wages, generating growing opposition from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions.[263]By 1990, 52,000 black families had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient to deal with the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population.[264] That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts.[265] The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 black families on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land.[265] Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.[266]Concerns about the proposed measure—particularly its denial of the right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.[265] The US, UK, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages.[267] Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law.[268] Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated.[269] In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza.[270] Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.[271]In January 1992, secondnameplaceholder's wife died.[272] In April 1995, Horizon magazine revealed that secondnameplaceholder had secretly been having an affair with his secretary Grace Marufu since 1987 and that she had borne him a son and a daughter.[273] His secret revealed, secondnameplaceholder decided to hold a much-publicised wedding. 12,000 people were invited to the August 1996 ceremony, which took place in Kutama and was orchestrated by the head of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Harare, Patrick Chakaipa.[274] The ceremony was controversial among the Catholic community because of the adulterous nature of secondnameplaceholder and Marufu's relationship.[275] To house his family, secondnameplaceholder then built a new mansion at Borrowdale.[276] In the 1995 parliamentary election—which saw a low turnout of 31.7%—ZANU–PF gained 147 out of 150 seats.[263] Following the election, secondnameplaceholder expanded his cabinet from 29 to 42 ministers while the government adopted a 133% pay rise for MPs.[277]Over the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy steadily deteriorated.[279] By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled.[280] By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%.[279] As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans—the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce—had left the country.[281] In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 secondnameplaceholder put together a pension package that would cost the county Z$4.2 billion.[282] To finance this pension scheme, secondnameplaceholder's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU–PF itself, secondnameplaceholder's government abandoned the taxes.[283] In January 1998, riots about lack of access to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured.[284]secondnameplaceholder increasingly blamed the country's economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry.[285] He called on supporters "to strike fear in the hearts of the white man, our real enemy",[280] and accused his black opponents of being dupes of the whites.[286] Amid growing internal opposition to his government, he remained determined to stay in power.[280] He revived the regular use of revolutionary rhetoric and sought to reassert his credentials as an important revolutionary leader.[287]secondnameplaceholder also developed a growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an "un-African" import from Europe.[288] He described gay people as being "guilty of sub-human behaviour", and of being "worse than dogs and pigs".[289] This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values, but it was strengthened by the fact that several ministers in the British government were gay. secondnameplaceholder began to believe that there was a "gay mafia" and that all of his critics were homosexuals.[290] Critics also accused secondnameplaceholder of using homophobia to distract attention from the country's problems.[288] In August 1995, he was due to open a human rights-themed Zimbabwe International Book Fair in Harare but refused to do so until a stall run by the group Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe was evicted.[291]In 1996, secondnameplaceholder was appointed chair of the defence arm of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).[292] Without consulting parliament, in August 1998 he ordered Zimbabwean troops into the Democratic Republic of the Congo to side with President Laurent Kabila in the Second Congo War.[293] He initially committed 3000 troops to the operation; this gradually rose to 11,000.[293] He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit troops to the conflict.[293] Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US$1 million a day, contributing to its economic problems.[293] Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population.[294] However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential trade terms in minerals from Kabila's government.[293]In January 1999, 23 military officers were arrested for plotting a coup against secondnameplaceholder. The government sought to hide this, but it was reported by journalists from The Standard. The military subsequently illegally arrested the journalists and tortured them.[295] This brought international condemnation, with the EU and seven donor nations issuing protest notes.[296] Lawyers and human rights activists protested outside parliament until they were dispersed by riot police,[296] and the country's Supreme Court judges issued a letter condemning the military's actions.[297] In response, secondnameplaceholder publicly defended the use of extra-legal arrest and torture.[298]In 1997, Tony Blair was elected Prime Minister of the UK after 18 years of Conservative rule. His Labour government expressed reticence toward restarting the land resettlement payments promised by the Lancaster House Agreement, with minister Clare Short rejecting the idea that the UK had any moral obligation to fund land redistribution.[299] This attitude fuelled anti-imperialist sentiment across Africa.[300] In October 1999, secondnameplaceholder visited Britain and in London, the human rights activist Peter Tatchell attempted to place him under citizen's arrest.[301] secondnameplaceholder believed that the British government had deliberately engineered the incident to embarrass him.[302] It further damaged Anglo-Zimbabwean relations,[302] with secondnameplaceholder expressing scorn for what he called "Blair and company".[303] In May 2000, the UK froze all development aid to Zimbabwe.[304] In December 1999, the IMF terminated financial support for Zimbabwe, citing economic mismanagement and widespread corruption as impediments to reform.[305]To meet growing demand for constitutional reform, in April 1999 secondnameplaceholder's government appointed a 400-member Constitutional Commission to draft a new constitution which could be put to a referendum.[306] The National Constitutional Assembly—a pro-reform pressure group established in 1997—expressed concern that this commission was not independent of the government, noting that secondnameplaceholder had the power to amend or reject the draft.[307] The NCA called for the draft constitution to be rejected, and in a February 2000 referendum it was, with 53% against to 44% in favour; turnout was under 25%.[308] It was ZANU–PF's first major electoral defeat in twenty years.[309] secondnameplaceholder was furious, and blamed the white minority for orchestrating his defeat, referring to them as "enemies of Zimbabwe".[310]The June 2000 parliamentary elections were Zimbabwe's most important since 1980.[311] Sixteen parties took part, and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)—led by trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai—was particularly successful.[311] During the election campaign, MDC activists were regularly harassed and in some cases killed.[312] The Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum documented 27 murders, 27 rapes, 2466 assaults, and 617 abductions, with 10,000 people displaced by violence; the majority, but not all, of these actions were carried out by ZANU–PF supporters.[313] Observers from the European Union (EU) ruled that the election was neither free nor fair.[314] The vote produced 48% and 62 parliamentary seats for ZANU-PF and 47% and 57 parliamentary seats for the MDC.[315] For the first time, ZANU–PF were denied the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to push through constitutional change.[311] ZANU–PF had relied heavily on their support base in rural Shona-speaking areas, and retained only one urban constituency.[316]In February 2000, land invasions began as armed gangs attacked and occupied white-owned farms.[317] The government referred to the attackers as "war veterans" but the majority were unemployed youth too young to have fought in the Rhodesian War.[317] secondnameplaceholder claimed that the attacks were a spontaneous uprising against white land owners, although the government had paid Z$20 million to Chenjerai Hunzvi's War Veterans Association to lead the land invasion campaign and ZANU–PF officials, police, and military figures were all involved in facilitating it.[318] Some of secondnameplaceholder's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing the success of the 'no' vote in the recent referendum.[319] secondnameplaceholder justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s.[320] He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government.[321] In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments.[322]In March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court ruled that the land invasions were illegal; they nevertheless continued,[323] and secondnameplaceholder began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary.[324] After the Supreme Court also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully pressuring Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay to do so.[325] ZANU–PF member Godfrey Chidyausiku was appointed to replace him, while the number of Supreme Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-secondnameplaceholder figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal.[326] In November 2001, secondnameplaceholder issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.[327] The farm seizures were often violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, with many of their employees experiencing intimidation and torture.[328] A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertiliser.[329]The farm invasions severely impacted agricultural development.[331] Zimbabwe had produced over two million tons of maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000.[328] By October 2003, Human Rights Watch reported that half of the country's population were food insecure, lacking enough food to meet basic needs.[332] By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time.[332] Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US$7.4 billion; by 2005 this had declined to US$3.4 billion.[333] Hyperinflation resulted in economic crisis.[329] By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%.[333] By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage.[334] Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.[332]Other sectors of society were negatively affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed,[335] and by 2008 only 20% of children were in schooling.[335] The breakdown of water supplies and sewage systems resulted in a cholera outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009.[336] The ruined economy also impacted the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%.[337] In 2007, the World Health Organization declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997.[333] The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated,[338] and there was a rise in poaching, including of endangered species.[338] secondnameplaceholder directly exacerbated this problem when he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.[338]In October 2000, the MDC's MPs attempted to impeach secondnameplaceholder, but were thwarted by the Speaker of the House, secondnameplaceholder loyalist Emmerson Mnangagwa.[339] ZANU–PF increasingly equated itself with Zimbabwean patriotism,[340] with MDC supporters being portrayed as traitors and enemies of Zimbabwe.[341] The party presented itself as being on the progressive side of history, with the MDC representing a counter-revolutionary force that seeks to undermine the achievements of the ZANU–PF revolution and of decolonisation itself.[342] secondnameplaceholder claimed that the build-up to the 2002 presidential election represented "the third Chimurenga" and that it would set Zimbabwe free from its colonial heritage.[343] In the build-up to the election, the government changed the electoral rules and regulations to improve secondnameplaceholder's chances of victory.[344] New security legislation was introduced making it illegal to criticise the President.[344] The defence force commander, General Vitalis Zvinavashe, stated that the military would not recognise any election result other than a secondnameplaceholder victory.[345] The EU withdrew its observers from the country, stating that the vote was neither free nor fair.[345] The election resulted in secondnameplaceholder securing 56% of the vote to Tsvangirai's 42%.[346] In the aftermath of the election secondnameplaceholder declared that the state-owned Grain Marketing Board had the sole right to import and distribute grain, with the state distributors giving food to ZANU–PF supporters while withholding it from those suspected of backing the MDC.[347] In 2005, secondnameplaceholder instituted Operation Murambatsvina ("Operation Drive Out the Rubbish"), a project of forced slum clearance; a UN report estimated that 700,000 were left homeless. Since the inhabitants of the shantytowns overwhelmingly voted MDC, many alleged that the bulldozing was politically motivated.[348]secondnameplaceholder's actions brought strong criticism. The Zimbabwe Council of Churches accused him of plunging the country into "a de facto state of warfare" to stay in power.[349] Several Southern African states remonstrated with him at a summit in Harare in September 2001.[350] In 2002, the Commonwealth expelled Zimbabwe from among its ranks; secondnameplaceholder blamed this on anti-black racism,[351] a view echoed by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki.[352] Mbeki favoured a policy of "quiet diplomacy" in dealing with secondnameplaceholder,[353] and prevented the African Union (AU) from introducing sanctions against him.[354] The Africa-Europe Summit, scheduled to take place in Lisbon in April 2003, was deferred repeatedly because African leaders refused to attend while secondnameplaceholder was banned; it eventually took place in 2007 with secondnameplaceholder in attendance.[355] In 2004, the EU imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on secondnameplaceholder.[351] It extended these sanctions in 2008,[351] with the US government introducing further sanctions this same year.[356] The US and UK introduced a resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an arms embargo of Zimbabwe alongside an asset freeze and travel ban of secondnameplaceholder and other government figures; it was vetoed by Russia and China.[356] In 2009, the SADC demanded that Western states lift their targeted sanctions against secondnameplaceholder and his government.[352] ZANU–PF presented the sanctions as a form of Western neo-colonialism and blamed the West for Zimbabwe's economic problems.[357]British prime minister Tony Blair allegedly planned regime change in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s as pressure intensified for secondnameplaceholder to step down.[358] British General Charles Guthrie, the Chief of the Defence Staff, revealed in 2007 that he and Blair had discussed the invasion of Zimbabwe.[359] However, Guthrie advised against military action: "Hold hard, you'll make it worse."[359] In 2013, South African President Thabo Mbeki said that Blair had also pressured South Africa to join in a "regime change scheme, even to the point of using military force" in Zimbabwe.[358] Mbeki refused because he felt that "secondnameplaceholder is part of the solution to this problem."[358] However, a spokesman for Blair said that "he never asked anyone to plan or take part in any such military intervention."[358]In March 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. In the former, ZANU–PF secured 97 seats to the MDC's 99 and the rival MDC – Ncube's 9.[360][361] In May, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced the presidential vote results, confirming that Tsvangirai secured 47.9%, to secondnameplaceholder's 43.2%. As neither candidate secured 50%, a run-off vote was scheduled.[362] secondnameplaceholder saw his defeat as an unacceptable personal humiliation.[363] He deemed it a victory for his Western, and in particular British, detractors, whom he believed were working with Tsvangirai to end his political career.[363] ZANU–PF claimed that the MDC had rigged the election.[364]After the election, secondnameplaceholder's government deployed its "war veterans" in a violent campaign against Tsvangirai supporters.[365] Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed.[366] There were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to gang rape by secondnameplaceholder supporters.[366] Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence.[366] These actions brought international condemnation of secondnameplaceholder's government.[citation needed] UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon expressed concern about the violence,[367] which was also unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council, which declared that a free and fair election was "impossible".[367] 40 senior African leaders—among them Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan, and Jerry Rawlings—signed an open letter calling for an end to the violence.[368]In response to the violence, Tsangirai pulled out of the run-off.[214] In the second round, secondnameplaceholder was pronounced victor with 85.5% of the vote, and immediately re-inaugurated as President.[369][370] The SADC oversaw the establishment of a power-sharing agreement; brokered by Mbeke, it was signed in September 2008.[371] Under the agreement, secondnameplaceholder remained President while Tsvangirai became Prime Minister and the MDC's Arthur Mutambara became Vice Prime Minister.[citation needed] The cabinet was equally divided among MDC and ZANU–PF members.[citation needed] ZANU–PF nevertheless displayed unwillingness to share power,[372] and were anxious to prevent any sweeping political changes.[373] Under the power-sharing agreement, a number of limited reforms were passed.[374] In early 2009, secondnameplaceholder's government declared that—to combat rampant inflation—it would recognise U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency.[336] This helped to stabilise prices.[336] ZANU–PF blocked many of the proposed reforms and a new constitution was passed in March 2013.[374]Declaring that he would "fight like a wounded animal" for re-election,[363] secondnameplaceholder approached the 2013 elections believing that it would be his last.[375] He hoped that a decisive electoral victory would secure his legacy, signal his triumph over his Western critics, and irreparably damage Tsvangirai's credibility.[375] The opposition parties believed that this election was their best chance for ousting secondnameplaceholder.[376] They portrayed him as a feeble old man who was being told what to do by the military;[377] at least one academic observer argued that this was untrue.[377]In contrast to 2008, there was no organised dissent against secondnameplaceholder within ZANU–PF.[378] The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred the 2008 election so as not to undermine its credibility,[374] particularly in the eyes of the SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference.[374] secondnameplaceholder called upon supporters to avoid violence,[374] and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger.[379] The ZANU–PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to vote for the party.[380]ZANU–PF won a landslide victory, with 61% of the presidential vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats.[381] The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election.[381] During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views out of fear of reprisals.[382] The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in the coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU–PF.[383] ZANU–PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.[384]In February 2014, secondnameplaceholder underwent a cataract operation in Singapore; on return he celebrated his ninetieth birthday at a Marondera football stadium.[385] In December 2014, secondnameplaceholder fired his Vice-President, Joice Mujuru, accusing her of plotting his overthrow.[386] In January 2015, secondnameplaceholder was elected as the Chairperson of the African Union (AU).[387] In November 2015, he announced his intention to run for re-election as Zimbabwe's President in 2018, at the age of 94, and was accepted as the ZANU–PF candidate.[388] In February 2016, secondnameplaceholder said he had no plans for retirement and would remain in power "until God says 'come'".[389] In February 2017, right after his 93rd birthday, secondnameplaceholder stated he would not retire nor pick a successor, even though he said he would let his party choose a successor if it saw fit.[390][391] In May 2017, secondnameplaceholder took a weeklong trip to Cancún, Mexico, ostensibly to attend a three-day conference on disaster risk reduction, eliciting criticism of wasteful spending from opposition figures.[392][393] He made three medical trips to Singapore in 2017, and Grace secondnameplaceholder called on him to name a successor.[394]In October 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) appointed secondnameplaceholder as a goodwill ambassador; this attracted criticism from both the Zimbabwean opposition and various foreign governments given the poor state of the Zimbabwean health system.[395] Responding to the outcry, WHO revoked secondnameplaceholder's appointment a day later.[396]  In response, foreign minister Walter Mzembi said the United Nations system should be reformed.[397]On 6 November 2017, secondnameplaceholder sacked his first vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. This fueled speculation that he intended to name Grace his successor. Grace was very unpopular with the ZANU–PF old guard. On 15 November 2017, the Zimbabwe National Army placed secondnameplaceholder under house arrest at his Blue Roof mansion as part of what it described as an action against "criminals" in secondnameplaceholder's circle.[398][399][400]On 19 November, he was sacked as leader of ZANU–PF, and Mnangagwa was appointed in his place.[401] The party also gave secondnameplaceholder an ultimatum: resign by noon the following day, or it would introduce an impeachment resolution against him. In a nationally televised speech that night, secondnameplaceholder refused to say that he would resign.[402] In response, ZANU–PF deputies introduced an impeachment resolution on 21 November 2017, which was seconded by the MDC–T.[403] The constitution stipulated that removing a president from office required a two-thirds majority of both the House of Assembly and Senate in a joint sitting. However, with both major parties supporting the motion and controlling all but six seats in both houses between them (all but four in the lower house and all but two in the upper house), secondnameplaceholder's impeachment and removal appeared all but certain.As per the constitution, both chambers met in joint session to debate the resolution. Hours after the debate began, the Speaker of the House of Assembly read a letter from secondnameplaceholder announcing that he had resigned, effective immediately.[404] secondnameplaceholder and his wife negotiated a deal before his resignation, under which he and his kin were exempted from prosecution, his business interests would remain untouched, and he would receive a payment of at least $10 million.[405][406] In July 2018, the Zimbabwe Supreme Court ruled that secondnameplaceholder had resigned voluntarily, despite some of the ex-president's subsequent comments.[407]
<h2>Post-presidency</h2>
Late in December 2017, according to a government gazette, secondnameplaceholder was given full diplomatic status and, out of public funds, a five-bedroom house, up to 23 staff members, and personal vehicles.  He further was permitted to keep the business interests and other wealth which he had amassed while in power, and he received an additional payment of about ten million dollars.[408]On 15 March 2018, in his first interview since removal from the presidency, secondnameplaceholder insisted that he had been ousted in a "coup d'état" which must be undone.  He stated that he would not work with Mnangagwa and termed Mnangagwa's presidency "illegal" and "unconstitutional".[409]  In a lawsuit brought by two political parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Revolutionary Freedom Fighters, and others, the court found that the resignation was legal, and that Mnangagwa, as vice-president, duly took over the presidency.[407]The state media reported that secondnameplaceholder had backed the National Political Front, which was formed by Ambrose Mutinhiri, a former high-ranking ZANU-PF politician who resigned in protest against secondnameplaceholder's removal from the presidency. The NPF posted a picture of Mutinhiri posing with secondnameplaceholder[410] and issued a press release in which it said that the former president had praised the decision.[411]On the eve of the 29 July 2018 general election, the first in 38 years in which he would not be a candidate, secondnameplaceholder held a surprise press conference, in which he stated that he would not vote for President Mnangagwa and ZANU–PF, the party he founded. Instead, he intended to vote for Nelson Chamisa, the candidate for his long-time rivals, the MDC.[412][413][414][415]secondnameplaceholder was unable to walk, according to President Mnangagwa in November 2018, and had been receiving treatment in Singapore for the previous two months.[416] He was hospitalised in Singapore in April 2019, making the last of several trips to the country for medical treatment, as he had done late in his presidency and following his resignation.[417][418][419] He died at Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore on 6 September 2019 at about 10:40 a.m. (Singapore Standard Time), according to a senior Zimbabwean diplomat.[420] Although the cause of death was not officially disclosed,[421] his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa told ZANU–PF supporters in New York City that secondnameplaceholder had advanced cancer and his chemotherapy treatment had ceased to be effective.[422][423]On 11 September 2019, his body was flown back to the Harare airport in Zimbabwe,[424][425] where 1,000 had gathered to wait for the body and listen to a speech from president Emmerson Mnangagwa.[426] secondnameplaceholder's body was then driven to the family residence in Borrowdale for a private wake attended by his friends and family, but not president Mnangagwa.[426] The Associated Press reported that no supporters had gathered along the procession route, but 500 mourners gathered in his birthplace of Zvimba.[426] On 13 September 2019, it was announced that the secondnameplaceholder family had accepted the Mnangagwa government's request to have secondnameplaceholder buried at Heroes Acre Cemetery and to have his burial be delayed for 30 days.[427][428] The secondnameplaceholder family had initially rejected the government's burial plan and intended for him to be buried in Zvimba on either 16 or 17 September, a day later than the government's proposal.[426][429][430][431]On 14 September 2019, secondnameplaceholder's state funeral,[432][433] which was also open to public attendance, was held at the National Sports Stadium, with an aerial photo showing the 60,000 capacity stadium to be about a quarter full.[434] The funeral was attended by leaders of various African countries, including Mnangagwa, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Hifikepunye Pohamba and Hage Geingob both of Namibia, Joseph Kabila of DR Congo, Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and many others.[434]On 26 September 2019, Nick Mangwana stated that secondnameplaceholder would be buried in his home town of Kutama "to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes".[435] The burial took place on 28 September in a courtyard of his family home.[436]
<h2>Ideology</h2>
secondnameplaceholder embraced African nationalism and anti-colonialism during the 1960s.[438] Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised "secondnameplaceholderism" as a populist movement that was "marked by ideological simplicity, emptiness, vagueness, imprecision, and multi-class character",[439] further noting that it was "a broad church".[440] He also characterised it as a form of "left-nationalism",[441] which consistently railed against imperialism and colonialism.[442] He also argued that it was a form of nativism,[443] which was permeated by a strong "cult of victimisation" in which a binary view was propagated where Africa was a "victim" and the West was its "tormentor".[444] He suggested that it had been influenced by a wide range of ideologies, among them forms of Marxism like Stalinism and Maoism, as well as African nationalist ideologies like Nkrumaism, Ujamaa, Garveyism, Négritude, Pan-Africanism, and African neo-traditionalism.[439] secondnameplaceholderism sought to deal with the problem of white settler racism by engaging in a project of anti-white racism that sought to deny white Zimbabweans citizenship by constantly referring to them as "amabhunu/Boers", thus enabling their removal from their land.[445]ZANU–PF claimed that it was influenced by Marxism–Leninism; Onslow and Redding stated that in contrast to the Marxist emphasis on the urban proletariat as the main force of socio-economic change, secondnameplaceholder's party accorded that role to the rural peasantry.[342] As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, secondnameplaceholder and the ZANU–PF demonstrated an anti-urban bias.[342] The English academic Claire Palley met secondnameplaceholder in 1962, later noting that "he struck me as not so much a doctrinaire Marxist but an old-fashioned African nationalist",[446] while Tekere claimed that for secondnameplaceholder, Marxism-Leninism was "just rhetoric" with "no genuine vision or belief behind it".[447] Carington noted that while secondnameplaceholder used Marxist rhetoric during the Lancaster House negotiations, "of course he didn't actually practise what he preached, did he? Once in office he became a capitalist".[448] secondnameplaceholder has stated that "socialism has to be much more Christian than capitalism".[449] The Zimbabwean scholar George Shire described secondnameplaceholder's policies as being "broadly-speaking" social-democratic.[450]During the 1980s, secondnameplaceholder indicated his desire to transform Zimbabwe from a multi-party state into a one-party state.[451] In 1984 he stated that "the one-party state is more in keeping with African tradition. It makes for greater unity for the people. It puts all opinions under one umbrella, whether these opinions are radical or reactionary".[451] The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was "more complex than pure venial dictatorship", but that it was an "ideo-dictatorship".[287] secondnameplaceholder openly admired Nicolae Ceaușescu of Romania, praising him just before he was overthrown in December 1989.[452]Ndlovu-Gatsheni argued that since the mid-1990s, secondnameplaceholder's rhetoric and speeches came to be dominated by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism.[453] References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in his speeches.[375] The scholar of African studies Abiodun Alao noted that secondnameplaceholder was determined to "take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security".[454]David Blair stated that "secondnameplaceholder's collected writings amount to nothing more than crude Marxism, couched in the ponderous English of the mission school", remarking that they were heavily informed by Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, and Frantz Fanon, and displayed little originality.[115] Blair noted that secondnameplaceholder's writings called for "command economics in a peasant society, mixed with anti-colonial nationalism", and that in this he held "the same opinions as almost every other African guerrilla leader" of that period.[115] secondnameplaceholder argued that following the overthrow of European colonial regimes, Western countries continued to keep African countries in a state of subservience because they desired the continent's natural resources while preventing it from industrialising.[455]
<h2>Personal life</h2>
secondnameplaceholder measured a little over 1.70 metres (5 ft 7 in),[456] and exhibited what his biographer David Blair described as "curious, effeminate mannerisms".[456] secondnameplaceholder took great care with his appearance, typically wearing a three-piece suit,[456] and insisted that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar Anglophile fashion.[457] On taking power in 1980, secondnameplaceholder's hallmark was his wide-rimmed glasses,[173] and he was also known for his tiny moustache.[456] Unlike a number of other African leaders, secondnameplaceholder did not seek to mythologise his childhood.[458] He avoided smoking and drinking,[34] and—according to his first biographers, David Smith and Colin Simpson—had "enormous affection for children".[459] During his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis; such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster the claim that he was willing to make severe sacrifices for the revolutionary cause.[460]secondnameplaceholder spoke English fluently with an adopted English accent when pronouncing certain words.[456] He was also a fan of the English game of cricket, stating that "cricket civilizes people and creates good gentlemen".[456] David Blair noted that this cultivation of British traits suggested that secondnameplaceholder respected and perhaps admired Britain while at the same time resenting and loathing the country.[6] Heidi Holland suggested that these Anglophile traits arose in early life, as secondnameplaceholder—who had long experienced the anti-black racism of Rhodesian society—"grasped Englishness as an antidote" to the "self-loathing" induced by societal racism.[461]The academic Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that secondnameplaceholder was "an extremely complex figure, not easily captured by conventional categories".[462] Similarly, David Blair described him as an "exceptionally complex personality".[6] Smith and Simpson noted that the Zimbabwean leader had been "a serious young man, something of a loner, diligent, hard-working, a voracious reader who used every minute of his time, not much given to laughter: but above all, single-minded".[463] Blair commented that secondnameplaceholder's "self-discipline, intelligence and appetite for hard work were remarkable",[456] adding that his "prime characteristics" were "ruthlessness and resilience".[115] Blair argued that secondnameplaceholder shared many character traits with Ian Smith, stating that they were both "proud, brave, stubborn, charismatic, deluded fantasists".[464]Meredith described secondnameplaceholder as having a "soft-spoken demeanour, ... broad intellect, and ... articulate manner", all of which disguised his "hardened and single-minded ambition".[106] Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised him as "one of the most charismatic African leaders", highlighting that he was "very eloquent" and was able to make "fine speeches".[441] Jonathan Moyo, who briefly served as secondnameplaceholder's information minister before falling out with him, stated that the President could "express himself well, that is his great strength".[466]
Tendi stated that secondnameplaceholder had a natural wittiness, but often hid this behind "an outwardly pensive and austere manner and his penchant for ceremony and tradition".[467] Heidi Holland suggested that due to his "dysfunctional" upbringing, secondnameplaceholder had a "fragile self-image",[468] describing him as "a man cut off from his feelings, devoid of ordinary warmth and humanity".[469] According to her, secondnameplaceholder had a "marked emotional immaturity",[470] and was homophobic,[471] as well as racist and xenophobic.[472]According to Meredith, secondnameplaceholder presented himself as "articulate, thoughtful, and conciliatory" after his 1980 election victory.[170] Blair noted that at this period of his career, secondnameplaceholder displayed "genuine magnanimity and moral courage" despite his "intense personal reasons for feeling bitterness and hatred" toward the members of the former regime.[458] Following his dealing with secondnameplaceholder during the 1979 negotiations, Michael Pallister, head of the British Foreign Office, described secondnameplaceholder as having "a very sharp, sometimes rather aggressive, and unpleasant manner".[126] The British diplomat Peter Longworth stated that in private, secondnameplaceholder was "very charming and very articulate and he's not devoid of humour. It's very difficult to relate the man you meet with the man ranting on television".[456] Norman stated that "I always found him personable and honourable in his dealings. He also had a warm side to him which I saw quite clearly sometimes".[473]Colin Legum, a journalist with The Observer, argued that secondnameplaceholder had a "paranoidal personality", in that while he did not suffer from clinical paranoia, he did behave in a paranoid fashion when placed under severe and sustained pressure.[6] secondnameplaceholder biographer Andrew Norman suggested that the leader may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder.[474] Several secondnameplaceholder biographers have observed that he had an obsession with accruing power.[475] According to Meredith, "power for secondnameplaceholder was not a means to an end, but the end itself."[476] Conversely, Onslow and Redding suggested that secondnameplaceholder's craving for power stemmed from "ideological and personal reasons" and his belief in the illegitimacy of his political opposition.[342] Denis Norman, a white politician who served in secondnameplaceholder's cabinet for many years, commented that "secondnameplaceholder isn't a flashy man driven by wealth but he does enjoy power. That's always been his motivation".[477]According to Holland, secondnameplaceholder's first wife, Sally Hayfron, was secondnameplaceholder's "confidante and only real friend",[478] being "one of the few people who could challenge secondnameplaceholder's ideas without offending him".[479] Their only son, Michael Nhamodzenyika secondnameplaceholder, born 27 September 1963, died on 26 December 1966 from cerebral malaria in Ghana where Sally was working while secondnameplaceholder was in prison. Sally secondnameplaceholder was a trained teacher who asserted her position as an independent political activist and campaigner.[480]secondnameplaceholder called on Zimbabwe's media to refer to his wife as "Amai" ("Mother of the Nation"),[481] although many Zimbabweans resented the fact that she was a foreigner.[482] She was appointed as the head of ZANU–PF's women's league,[481] and was involved in a number of charitable operations, and was widely regarded as corrupt in these dealings.[483] During secondnameplaceholder's premiership she suffered from renal failure, and initially had to travel to Britain for dialysis until Soames arranged for a dialysis machine to be sent to Zimbabwe.[484]While married to Hayfron, in 1987 secondnameplaceholder began an extra-marital affair with his secretary, Grace Marufu; she was 41 years his junior and at the time was married to Stanley Goreraza. In 1988 she bore secondnameplaceholder a daughter, Bona, and in 1990 a son, firstnameplaceholder.[485] The relationship was kept secret from the Zimbabwean public; Hayfron was aware of it.[481] According to her niece Patricia Bekele, with whom she was particularly close, Hayfron was not happy that secondnameplaceholder had an affair with Marufu but "she did what she used to tell me to do: 'Talk to your pillow if you have problems in your marriage. Never, ever, humiliate your husband.' Her motto was to carry on in gracious style".[486] Hayfron died in 1992 from a chronic kidney ailment.[487]Following Hayfron's death in 1992, secondnameplaceholder and Marufu were married in a large Catholic ceremony in August 1996.[488] As First Lady of Zimbabwe, Grace gained a reputation for indulging her love of luxury, with a particular interest in shopping, clothes, and jewellery.[489] These lavish shopping sprees led to her receiving the nickname "Gucci Grace".[490] She too developed a reputation for corruption.[276] In 1997, Grace secondnameplaceholder gave birth to the couple's third child, Chatunga Bellarmine.[491] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Jr. and his younger brother, Chatunga, are known for posting their lavish lifestyle on social media, which has drawn accusations from opposition politician Tendai Biti that they are wasting Zimbabwean taxpayers' money.[492]
<h2>Public image and legacy</h2>
By the twenty-first century, secondnameplaceholder was regarded as one of the world's most controversial political leaders.[494] According to The Black Scholar journal, "depending on who you listen to...secondnameplaceholder is either one of the world's great tyrants or a fearless nationalist who has incurred the wrath of the West."[495] He has been widely described as a "dictator", a "tyrant", and a "threat",[496] and has been referred to as one of Africa's "most brutal" leaders.[497] At the same time he continued to be regarded as a hero in many Third World countries and received a warm reception when travelling throughout Africa.[498] For many in Southern Africa, he remained one of the "grand old men" of the African liberation movement.[352]According to Ndlovu-Gatsheni, within ZANU–PF, secondnameplaceholder was regarded as a "demi-god" who was feared and rarely challenged.[499] Within the ZANU movement, a cult of personality began to be developed around secondnameplaceholder during the Bush War and was consolidated after 1980.[500] secondnameplaceholder had a considerable following within Zimbabwe,[379] with David Blair noting that "it would be wrong to imply that he lacked genuine popularity" in the country.[263] Holland believed that the "great majority" of Zimbabwe's population supported him "enthusiastically" during the first twenty years of his regime.[501] His strongholds of support were Zimbabwe's Shona-dominated regions of Mashonaland, Manicaland, and Masvingo, while he remained far less popular in the non-Shona areas of Matabeleland and Bulawayo,[263] and among the Zimbabwean diaspora living abroad.[281]At the time of his 1980 election victory, secondnameplaceholder was internationally acclaimed as a revolutionary hero who was embracing racial reconciliation,[193] and for the first decade of his governance he was widely regarded as "one of post-colonial Africa's most progressive leaders".[502] David Blair argued that while secondnameplaceholder did exhibit a "conciliatory phase" between March 1980 and February 1982, his rule was otherwise "dominated by a ruthless quest to crush his opponents and remain in office at whatever cost".[503] In 2011, the scholar Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that "secondnameplaceholder is often presented in the international media as the epitome of the popular leader gone awry: the independence struggle hero who seemed initially a progressive egalitarian, but has gradually been corrupted through his attachment to power during a long and increasingly repressive spell in office."[504] Tendi argued that this was a misleading assessment, because secondnameplaceholder had displayed repressive tendencies from his early years in office, namely through the repression of ZAPU in Matabeleland.[239] Abiodun Alao concurred, suggesting that secondnameplaceholder's approach had not changed over the course of his leadership, but merely that international attention had intensified in the twenty-first century.[497]
For many Africans, secondnameplaceholder exposed the double standards of Western countries; the latter had turned a blind eye to the massacre of over 20,000 black Ndebele civilians in the Gukarakundi but strongly censured the Zimbabwean government when a small number of white farmers were killed during the land seizures.[498]During the guerrilla war, Ian Smith referred to secondnameplaceholder as "the apostle of Satan".[505] George Shire expressed the view that there was "a strong racist animus" against secondnameplaceholder within Zimbabwe, and that this had typically been overlooked by Western media representations of the country.[450] secondnameplaceholder himself was accused of racism; John Sentamu, the Uganda-born Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom, called secondnameplaceholder "the worst kind of racist dictator", for having "targeted the whites for their apparent riches".[506][507][508][509] Desmond Tutu stated that secondnameplaceholder became "increasingly insecure, he's hitting out. One just wants to weep. It's very sad."[510] South African President Nelson Mandela was also critical of secondnameplaceholder, referring to him as a politician who "despise[s] the very people who put [him] in power and think[s] it's a privilege to be there for eternity".[510]Writing for the Human Rights Quarterly, Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann claimed that there was "clear evidence that secondnameplaceholder was guilty of crimes against humanity".[511] In 2009, Gregory Stanton, then President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and Helen Fein, then Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of Genocide, published a letter in The New York Times stating that there was sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity to bring secondnameplaceholder to trial in front of the International Criminal Court.[512] Australia and New Zealand had previously called for this in 2005,[512] and a number of Zimbabwean NGOs did so in 2006.[512]A 2005 article from the New American titled "Democide in Zimbabwe" says that secondnameplaceholder reduced the population of Zimbabwe by millions in just a few years.[513]In 1994, secondnameplaceholder received an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from him at the advice of the UK government in 2008.[514] secondnameplaceholder held several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded to him in the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984.[515][516] On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to secondnameplaceholder in 1986, the first time one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.[517] In the month after being deposed, but before he died, many of the public references to secondnameplaceholder – street names, for example – had been removed from public places.[518]

Pol Pot[a] (born firstnameplaceholder Sâr;[b] 19 May 1925 – 15 April 1998) was a Cambodian revolutionary and politician who governed Cambodia as the Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea between 1975 and 1979. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist and a Khmer nationalist, he was a leading member of Cambodia's communist movement, the Khmer Rouge, from 1963 until 1997 and served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea[c] from 1963 to 1981. Under his administration, Cambodia was converted into a one-party communist state governed according to Pol Pot's interpretation of Marxism–Leninism.Born to a prosperous farmer in Prek Sbauv, French Cambodia, Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's most elite schools. While in Paris during the 1940s, he joined the French Communist Party. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist–Leninist Khmer Việt Minh organisation and its guerrilla war against King Norodom Sihanouk's newly independent government. Following the Khmer Việt Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist–Leninist controlled North Vietnam, Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh, working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist–Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he relaunched the war against Sihanouk's government. After Lon Nol ousted Sihanouk in a 1970 coup, Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against the new government, which was bolstered by the United States military. Aided by the Việt Cộng militia and North Vietnamese troops, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces advanced and controlled all of Cambodia by 1975.Pol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an agrarian socialist society that he believed would evolve into a communist society, Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on collective farms. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens were made to wear the same black clothing. Pol Pot was a driving force behind the Cambodian genocide, the systematic persecution and killing of Cambodians that the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies. The genocide, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population. Repeated purges of the CPK generated growing discontent; by 1978 Cambodian soldiers were mounting a rebellion in the east. After several years of border clashes, the newly unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, toppling Pol Pot and installing a rival Marxist–Leninist government in 1979. The Khmer Rouge retreated to the jungles near the Thai border, from where they continued to fight. In declining health, Pol Pot stepped back from many of his roles in the movement. In 1998 the Khmer Rouge commander Ta Mok placed Pol Pot under house arrest, shortly after which he died.Taking power at the height of Marxism–Leninism's global impact, Pol Pot proved divisive among the international communist movement. Many claimed he deviated from orthodox Marxism–Leninism, but China backed his government as a bulwark against Soviet influence in Southeast Asia. To his supporters, he was a champion of Cambodian sovereignty in the face of Vietnamese imperialism and stood against the Marxist revisionism of the Soviet Union. Conversely, he has been internationally denounced for his role in the Cambodian genocide and is regarded as a totalitarian dictator guilty of crimes against humanity.
<h2>Early life</h2>
Pol Pot was born in the village of Prek Sbauv, outside the city of Kampong Thom.[3] He was named firstnameplaceholder Sâr (Khmer: សាឡុត ស pronounced [saː.ˈlot sɑː]), the word sâr ("white, pale") referencing his comparatively light skin complexion.[4] French colonial records placed his birth date on 25 May 1928,[5] but biographer Philip Short argues he was born in March 1925.[6]His family was of mixed Chinese and ethnic Khmer heritage, but did not speak Chinese and lived as though they were fully Khmer.[4] His father Loth, who later took the name firstnameplaceholder Phem, was a prosperous farmer who owned nine hectares of rice land and several draft cattle.[7] Loth's house was one of the largest in the village and at transplanting and harvest time he hired poorer neighbors to carry out much of the agricultural labour.[6] Sâr's mother, Sok Nem, was locally respected as a pious Buddhist.[8] Sâr was the eighth of nine children (two girls and seven boys),[8] three of whom died young.[9] They were raised as Theravada Buddhists, and on festivals travelled to the Kampong Thom monastery.[10]Cambodia was a monarchy, but the French colonial regime, not the king, was in political control.[11] Sâr's family had connections to the Cambodian royalty: his cousin Meak was a consort of King Sisowath Monivong and later worked as a ballet teacher.[12] When Sâr was six years old, he and an older brother were sent to live with Meak in Phnom Penh; informal adoptions by wealthier relatives were then common in Cambodia.[8] In Phnom Penh, he spent 18 months as a novice monk in the city's Vat Botum Vaddei monastery, learning Buddhist teachings and to read and write the Khmer language.[13]In summer 1935, Sâr went to live with his brother Suong and the latter's wife and child.[14] That year he began an education at a Roman Catholic primary school, the École Miche,[15] with Meak paying the tuition fees.[16] Most of his classmates were the children of French bureaucrats and Catholic Vietnamese.[16] He became literate in French and familiar with Christianity.[16] Sâr was not academically gifted and was held back two years, receiving his Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Complémentaires in 1941 at the age of 16.[17] He had continued to visit Meak at the king's palace and it was there that he had some of his earliest sexual experiences with some of the king's concubines.[18]While Sâr was at the school, the King of Cambodia died. In 1941 the French authorities appointed Norodom Sihanouk as his replacement.[19] A new junior middle school, the Collége Pream Sihanouk, was established in Kampong Cham, and Sâr was selected as a boarder at the institution in 1942.[20] This level of education afforded him a privileged position in Cambodian society.[21] He learned to play the violin and took part in school plays.[22] Much of his spare time was spent playing football and basketball.[23] Several fellow pupils, among them Hu Nim and Khieu Samphan, later served in his government.[24] During the new year vacation in 1945, Sâr and several friends from his college theatre troupe went on a provincial tour in a bus to raise money for a trip to Angkor Wat.[25] In 1947, he left the school.[26]That year he passed exams that admitted him into the Lycée Sisowath, meanwhile living with Suong and his new wife.[27] In summer 1948, he sat the brevet entry exams for the upper classes of the Lycée, but failed. Unlike several of his friends, he could not continue on at the school for a baccalauréat.[28] Instead, he enrolled in 1948 to study carpentry at the Ecole Technique in Russey Keo, in Phnom Penh's northern suburbs.[29] This drop from an academic education to a vocational one likely came as a shock.[30] His fellow students were generally of a lower class than those at the Lycée Sisowath, though they were not peasants.[21] At the Ecole Technique he met Ieng secondnameplaceholdery, who became a close friend and later a member of his government.[21] In summer 1949, Sâr passed his brevet and secured one of five scholarships allowing him to travel to France to study at one of its engineering schools.[31]During the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded France and in 1945 the Japanese ousted the French from Cambodia, with Sihanouk proclaiming his country's independence.[32] After the war ended with Germany's and Japan's defeat, France reasserted its control over Cambodia in 1946,[33] but allowed for the creation of a new constitution and the establishment of various political parties.[34] The most successful of these was the Democratic Party, which won the 1946 general election.[35] According to historian David Chandler, Sâr and secondnameplaceholdery worked for the party during its successful election campaign;[36] conversely, Short maintains that Sâr had no contact with the party.[30] Sihanouk opposed the party's left-leaning reforms and in 1948 dissolved the National Assembly, instead ruling by decree.[37] Operatives of Ho Chi Minh's better established Vietnamese Marxist–Leninist group, the Việt Minh, also established a nascent Marxist–Leninist movement, but it was beset by ethnic tensions between the Khmer and Vietnamese. News of the group was censored from the press and it is unlikely Sâr was aware of it.[38]Access to further education abroad made Sâr part of a tiny elite in Cambodia.[39] He and the 21 other selected students sailed from Saigon aboard the SS Jamaïque, stopping at Singapore, Colombo, and Djibouti en route to Marseille.[40] In January 1950, Sâr enrolled at the École française de radioélectricité to study radio electronics.[41] He took a room in the Cité Universitaire's Indochinese Pavilion,[42] then lodgings on the rue Amyot,[41] and eventually a bedsit on the corner of the rue de Commerce and the rue Letelier.[43] Sâr earned good marks during his first year. He failed his first end-of-year exams but was allowed to retake them and narrowly passed, enabling him to continue his studies.[44]Sâr spent three years in Paris.[42] In summer 1950, he was one of 18 Cambodian students who joined French counterparts in traveling to Yugoslavia, a Marxist–Leninist state, to volunteer in a labour battalion building a motorway in Zagreb.[45] He returned to Yugoslavia the following year for a camping holiday.[43] Sâr made little or no attempt to assimilate into French culture[46] and was never completely at ease in the French language.[41] He nevertheless became familiar with French literature, one of his favorite authors being Jean-Jacques Rousseau.[47] His most significant friendships in the country were with Ieng secondnameplaceholdery, who had joined him there, Thiounn Mumm and Keng Vannsak.[48] He was a member of Vannsak's discussion circle, whose ideologically diverse membership discussed ways to achieve Cambodian independence.[49]In Paris, Ieng secondnameplaceholdery and two others established the Cercle Marxiste ("Marxist Circle"), a Marxist–Leninist organisation arranged in a clandestine cell system.[50] The cells met to read Marxist texts and hold self-criticism sessions.[51] Sâr joined a cell that met on the rue Lacepède; his cell comrades included Hou Yuon, Sien Ary, and Sok Knaol.[50] He helped to duplicate the Cercle's newspaper, Reaksmei ("The Spark"), named after a former Russian paper.[52] In October 1951, Yuon was elected head of the Khmer Student Association (AEK; l'Association des Etudiants Khmers), establishing close links between the organisation and the leftist Union Nationale des Étudiants de France.[53] The Cercle Marxiste manipulated the AEK and its successor organisations for the next 19 years.[50] Several months after the Cercle Marxiste's formation, Sâr and secondnameplaceholdery joined the French Communist Party (PCF).[54] Sâr attended party meetings, including those of its Cambodian group, and read its magazine, Les Cahiers Internationaux.[55] The Marxist–Leninist movement was then in a strong position globally; the Communist Party of China had recently come to power under Mao Zedong and the French Communist Party was one of the country's largest,[56] attracting the votes of around 25% of the French electorate.[57]Sâr found many of Karl Marx's denser texts difficult, later saying he "didn't really understand" them.[55] But he became familiar with the writings of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,[58] including The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).[55] Stalin's approach to Marxism—known as Stalinism—gave Sâr a sense of purpose in life.[59] Sâr also read Mao's work, especially On New Democracy, a text outlining a Marxist–Leninist framework for carrying out a revolution in colonial and semi-colonial, semi-feudal societies.[60] Alongside these texts, Sâr read the anarchist Peter Kropotkin's book on the French Revolution, The Great Revolution.[61] From Kropotkin he took the idea that an alliance between intellectuals and the peasantry was necessary for revolution; that a revolution had to be carried out without compromise to its conclusion to succeed; and that egalitarianism was the basis of a communist society.[62]In Cambodia, growing internal strife resulted in King Sihanouk dismissing the government and declaring himself prime minister.[63] In response, Sâr wrote an article, "Monarchy or Democracy?", published in the student magazine Khmer Nisut under the pseudonym "Khmer daom" ("Original Khmer").[64] In it, he referred positively to Buddhism, portraying Buddhist monks as an anti-monarchist force on the side of the peasantry.[65] At a meeting, the Cercle decided to send someone to Cambodia to assess the situation and determine which rebel group they should support; Sâr volunteered for the role.[66] His decision to leave may also have been because he had failed his second-year exams two years in a row and thus lost his scholarship.[67] In December, he boarded the SS Jamaïque,[68] returning to Cambodia without a degree.[69]
<h2>Revolutionary and political activism</h2>
Sâr arrived in Saigon on 13 January 1953, the same day on which Sihanouk disbanded the Democratic-controlled National Assembly, began ruling by decree, and imprisoned Democratic members of parliament without trial.[66] Amid the broader First Indochina War in neighboring French Indochina, Cambodia was in a civil war,[70] with civilian massacres and other atrocities carried out by all sides.[71] Sâr spent several months at the headquarters of Prince Norodom Chantaraingsey—the leader of one faction—in Trapeng Kroloeung,[72] before moving to Phnom Penh, where he met with fellow Cercle member Ping Say to discuss the situation.[73] Sâr regarded the Khmer Việt Minh, a mixed Vietnamese and Cambodian guerrilla subgroup of the North Vietnam-based Việt Minh, as the most promising resistance group. He believed the Khmer Việt Minh's relationship to the Việt Minh and thus the international Marxist–Leninist movement made it the best group for the Cercle Marxiste to support.[74] The Cercle members in Paris took his recommendation.[75]In August 1953, Sâr and Rath Samoeun travelled to Krabao, the headquarters of the Việt Minh Eastern Zone.[76] Over the following nine months, around 12 other Cercle members joined them there.[77] They found that the Khmer Việt Minh was run and numerically dominated by Vietnamese guerrillas, with Khmer recruits largely given menial tasks; Sâr was tasked with growing cassava and working in the canteen.[78] At Krabao, he gained a rudimentary grasp of Vietnamese,[79] and rose to become secretary and aide to Tou Samouth, the Secretary of the Khmer Việt Minh's Eastern Zone.[80]Sihanouk desired independence from French rule, but after France refused his requests he called for public resistance to its administration in June 1953. Khmer troops deserted the French Army in large numbers and the French government relented, rather than risk a costly, protracted war to retain control.[81] In November, Sihanouk declared Cambodia's independence.[82] The civil conflict then intensified, with France backing Sihanouk's war against the rebels.[83] Following the Geneva Conference held to end the First Indochina War, Sihanouk secured an agreement from the North Vietnamese that they would withdraw Khmer Việt Minh forces from Cambodian territory.[84] The last Khmer Việt Minh units left Cambodia for North Vietnam in October 1954.[85] Sâr was not among them, deciding to remain in Cambodia; he trekked, via South Vietnam, to Prey Veng to reach Phnom Penh.[86] He and other Cambodian Marxist–Leninists decided to pursue their aims through electoral means.[87]Cambodia's Marxist–Leninists wanted to operate clandestinely but also established a socialist party, Pracheachon, to serve as a front organization through which they could compete in the 1955 election.[88] Although Pracheachon had strong support in some areas, most observers expected the Democratic Party to win.[89] The Marxist–Leninists engaged in entryism to influence Democratic Party policy; Vannsak had become deputy party secretary, with Sâr as his assistant, perhaps helping to alter the party's platform.[90] Sihanouk feared a Democratic Party government and in March 1955 abdicated the throne in favor of his father, Norodom Suramarit. This allowed him to legally establish a political party, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum, with which to contest the election.[91] The September election witnessed widespread voter intimidation and electoral fraud, resulting in Sangkum winning all 91 seats.[92] Sihanouk's establishment of a de facto one-party state extinguished hopes that the Cambodian left could take power electorally.[93] North Vietnam's government nevertheless urged Cambodia's Marxist–Leninists not to restart the armed struggle; the former was focused on undermining South Vietnam and had little desire to destabilize Sihanouk's regime given that it had—conveniently for them—remained internationally un-aligned rather than following the Thai and South Vietnamese governments in allying with the anti-communist United States.[94]Sâr rented a house in the Boeng Keng Kang area of Phnom Penh.[95] Although not qualified to teach at a state school,[96] he gained employment teaching history, geography, French literature, and morals at a private school, the Chamraon Vichea ("Progressive Knowledge");[97] his pupils, who included the later novelist Soth Polin, described him as a good teacher.[98] He courted society belle Soeung Son Maly[99] before entering a relationship with fellow communist revolutionary Khieu Ponnary, the sister of secondnameplaceholdery's wife Thirith.[100] They were married in a Buddhist ceremony in July 1956.[101] He continued to oversee many of the Marxist–Leninists' underground communications; all correspondence between the Democratic Party and the Pracheachon went through him.[102] Sihanouk cracked down on the Marxist–Leninist movement, whose membership had halved since the end of the civil war.[103] Links with the North Vietnamese Marxist–Leninists declined, something Sâr later portrayed as a boon.[104] He and other members increasingly regarded Cambodians as too deferential to their Vietnamese counterparts; to deal with this, Sâr, Tou Samouth, and Nuon Chea drafted a programme and statutes for a new Marxist–Leninist party that would be allied with but not subordinate to the Vietnamese.[105] They established party cells, emphasising the recruitment of small numbers of dedicated members, and organized political seminars in safe houses.[106]At a 1959 conference, the movement's leadership established the Kampuchean Labour Party, based on the Marxist–Leninist model of democratic centralism. Sâr, Tou Samouth and Nuon Chea were part of a four-man General Affair Committee leading the party.[107] Its existence was to be kept secret from non-members.[108] The Kampuchean Labour Party's conference, held clandestinely from September to October 1960 in Phnom Penh, saw Samouth become party secretary and Nuon Chea his deputy, while Sâr took the third senior position and Ieng secondnameplaceholdery the fourth.[109][110]Sihanouk spoke out against the Cambodian Marxist–Leninists; although he was an ally of China's Marxist–Leninist government and professed a belief in Marxism–Leninism's capacity to bring swift economic development and social justice, he also warned of its totalitarian character and its suppression of personal liberty.[111] In January 1962, Sihanouk's security services cracked down further on Cambodia's socialists, incarcerating Pracheachon's leaders and leaving the party largely moribund.[112] In July, Samouth was arrested, tortured and killed.[113] Nuon Chea had also stepped back from his political activities, leaving open Sâr's path to become party leader.[114]As well as facing leftist opposition, Sihanouk's government faced hostility from right-wing opposition centred on Sihanouk's former Minister of State, Sam secondnameplaceholdery, who was backed by the United States, Thailand and South Vietnam.[115] After the South Vietnamese supported a failed coup against Sihanouk, relations between the countries deteriorated and the United States initiated an economic blockade of Cambodia in 1956.[116] After Sihanouk's father died in 1960, Sihanouk introduced a constitutional amendment allowing himself to become head of state for life.[117] In February 1962, anti-government student protests turned into riots, at which Sihanouk dismissed the Sangkum government, called new elections, and produced a list of 34 left-leaning Cambodians, demanding that they meet him to establish a new administration.[118] Sâr was on the list, perhaps because of his role as a teacher, but refused to meet with Sihanouk. He and Ieng secondnameplaceholdery left Phnom Penh for a Viet Cong encampment near Thboung Khmum in the jungle along Cambodia's border with South Vietnam.[119] According to Chandler, "from this point on he was a full-time revolutionary".[120]Conditions at the Viet Cong camp were basic and food scarce.[121] As Sihanouk's government cracked down on the movement in Phnom Penh, growing numbers of its members fled to join Sâr at his jungle base.[122] In February 1963, at the party's second conference, held in a central Phnom Penh apartment, Sâr was elected party secretary, but soon fled into the jungle to avoid repression by Sihanouk's government.[123] In early 1964, Sâr established his own encampment, Office 100, on the South Vietnamese side of the border. The Viet Cong allowed his actions to be officially separate from its own, but still wielded significant control over his camp.[122] At a plenum of the party's Central Committee, it was agreed that they should re-emphasize their independence from the Vietnamese Marxist–Leninists and endorse armed struggle against Sihanouk.[122]The Central Committee met again in January 1965 to denounce the "peaceful transition" to socialism espoused by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, accusing him of being a revisionist.[124] In contrast to Khrushchev's interpretation of Marxism–Leninism, Sâr and his comrades sought to develop their own, explicitly Cambodian variant of the ideology.[125] Their interpretation moved away from the orthodox Marxist focus on the urban proletariat as the forces of a revolution to build socialism, giving that role instead to the rural peasantry, a far larger class in Cambodian society.[126] By 1965, the party regarded Cambodia's small proletariat as full of "enemy agents" and systematically refused them membership.[127] The party's main area of growth was in the rural provinces and by 1965 membership was at 2000.[128] In April 1965, Sâr travelled by foot along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to Hanoi to meet North Vietnamese government figures, among them Ho Chi Minh and Lê Duẩn.[129] The North Vietnamese were preoccupied with the ongoing Vietnam War and thus did not want Sâr's forces to destabilize Sihanouk's government; the latter's anti-American stance rendered him a de facto ally.[130] In Hanoi, Sâr read through the archives of the Workers' Party of Vietnam, concluding that the Vietnamese Marxist–Leninists were committed to pursuing an Indochinese Federation and that their interests were therefore incompatible with Cambodia's.[131]In November 1965, firstnameplaceholder Sâr flew from Hanoi to Beijing, where his official host was Deng Xiaoping, although most of his meetings were with Peng Zhen.[132] Sâr gained a sympathetic hearing from many in the governing Communist Party of China (CPC)—especially Chen Boda, Zhang Chunqiao and Kang Sheng—who shared his negative view of Khrushchev amid the Sino-Soviet split.[133][134] CPC officials also trained him on topics like dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggles and political purge.[133][135] In Beijing, Sâr witnessed China's ongoing Cultural Revolution, influencing his later policies.[136]Sâr left Beijing in February 1966, and flew back to Hanoi before a four-month journey along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to reach the Cambodian Marxist–Leninists' new base at Loc Ninh.[133][137] In October 1966, he and other Cambodian party leaders made several key decisions. They renamed their organisation the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), a decision initially kept secret.[138] Sihanouk began referring to its members as the "Khmer Rouge" ('Red Cambodians'), but they did not adopt this term themselves.[139] It was agreed that they would move their headquarters in Ratanakiri Province, away from the Viet Cong,[140] and that—despite the views of the North Vietnamese—they would command each of the party's zone committees to prepare for the relaunch of armed struggle.[141] North Vietnam refused to assist in this, rejecting their requests for weaponry.[142] In November 1967, Sâr travelled from Tay Ninh to base Office 102 near Kang Lêng. During the journey, he contracted malaria and required a respite in a Viet Cong medical base near Mount Ngork.[143] By December, plans for armed conflict were complete, with the war to begin in the North-West Zone and then spread to other regions.[144] As communication across Cambodia was slow, each Zone would have to operate independently much of the time.[145]
<h2>Cambodian Civil War</h2>
In January 1968, the war was launched with an attack on the Bay Damran army post south of Battambang.[146] Further attacks targeted police and soldiers and seized weaponry.[145] The government responded with scorched-earth policies, aerially bombarding areas where rebels were active.[147] The army's brutality aided the insurgents' cause;[148] as the uprising spread, over 100,000 villagers joined them.[145] In the summer, Sâr relocated his base 30 miles north to the more mountainous Naga's Tail, to avoid encroaching government troops.[149] At this base, called K-5, he increased his dominance over the party and had his own separate encampment, staff, and guards. No outsider was allowed to meet him without an escort.[149] He took over from secondnameplaceholdery as the Secretary of the North East Zone.[150] In November 1969, Sâr trekked to Hanoi to persuade the North Vietnamese government to provide direct military assistance. They refused, urging him to revert to a political struggle.[151] In January 1970 he flew to Beijing.[151] There, his wife began showing early signs of the chronic paranoid schizophrenia she would later be diagnosed with.[152]In March 1970, while Sâr was in Beijing, Cambodian parliamentarians led by Lon Nol deposed Sihanouk when he was out of the country.[153] Sihanouk also flew to Beijing, where the Chinese and North Vietnamese Communist Parties urged him to form an alliance with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow Lon Nol's right-wing government. Sihanouk agreed.[154] On Zhou Enlai's advice, Sâr also agreed, although his dominant role in the CPK was concealed from Sihanouk.[155] Sihanouk then formed his own government-in-exile in Beijing and launched the National United Front of Kampuchea to rally Lon Nol's opponents.[156] Sihanouk's support for the Khmer Rouge helped greatly in recruitment, with Khmer Rouge undergoing a massive expansion in size. Many of the new recruits for the Khmer Rouge were apolitical peasants who fought in support of the King, not for communism, of which they had little understanding.[157]In April 1970, Sâr flew to Hanoi.[158] He stressed to Lê Duẩn that while he wanted the Vietnamese to supply the Khmer Rouge with weapons, he did not want troops: the Cambodians needed to oust Lon Nol themselves.[159] North Vietnamese armies, in collaboration with the Viet Cong, nevertheless invaded Cambodia to attack Lon Nol's forces; in turn, South Vietnam and the United States sent troops to the country to bolster his government.[160] This pulled Cambodia into the Second Indochina War already raging across Vietnam.[161] The U.S. dropped three times as many bombs on Cambodia during the conflict as they had on Japan during World War II.[162] Although targeting Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge encampments, the bombing primarily affected civilians.[163] This helped fuel recruitment to the Khmer Rouge,[164] which had an estimated 12,000 regular soldiers at the end of 1970 and four times that number by 1972.[165]In June 1970, Sâr left Vietnam and reached his K-5 base.[166] In July he headed south; it was at this point that he began referring to himself as "Pol", a name he later lengthened to "Pol Pot".[167] By September, he was based at a camp on the border of Kratie and Kompong Thom, where he convened a meeting of the CPK Standing Committee. Although few senior members could attend, it issued a resolution setting out the principle of "independence-mastery", the idea that Cambodia must be self-reliant and fully independent of other countries.[168] In November, Pol Pot, Ponnary, and their entourage relocated to the K-1 base at Dângkda.[169] His residence was set up on the northern side of the Chinit river; entry was strictly controlled.[170] By the end of the year, Marxist forces had a presence in over half of Cambodia;[162] the Khmer Rouge played a restricted role in this, for throughout 1971 and 1972, the majority of fighting against Lon Nol was carried out by Vietnamese or by Cambodians under Vietnamese control.[171]In January 1971, a Central Committee meeting was held at this base, bringing together 27 delegates to discuss the war.[172] During 1971, Pol Pot and the other senior party members focused on the construction of a regular Khmer Rouge army and administration that could take a central role when the Vietnamese withdrew.[169] Membership of the party was made more selective, permitting only those regarded as "poor peasants", not those seen as "middle peasants" or students.[173] In July and August, Pol Pot oversaw a month-long training course for CPK cadres in the Northern Zone headquarters.[174] This was followed by the CPK's Third Congress, attended by around 60 delegates, where Pol Pot was confirmed as the Secretary of the Central Committee and Chairman of its Military Commission.[174]In early 1972, Pol Pot embarked on his first tour of the Marxist-controlled areas across Cambodia.[174] In these areas, called "liberated zones", corruption was stamped out, gambling was banned, and alcohol and extramarital affairs were discouraged.[175] From 1970 to 1971, the Khmer Rouge had generally sought to cultivate good relations with the inhabitants, organising local elections and assemblies.[176] Some people regarded as hostile to the movement were executed, although this was uncommon.[175] Private motor transport was requisitioned.[177]  Cooperative stores selling goods like medicines, cloth, and kerosene were formed, providing goods imported from Vietnam.[177] Wealthier peasants had their land redistributed so that by the end of 1972, all families living in the Marxist-controlled areas possessed an equal amount of land.[178]  The poorest strata of Cambodian society benefited from these reforms.[177]From 1972, the Khmer Rouge began trying to refashion all of Cambodia in the image of the poor peasantry, whose rural, isolated, and self-sufficient lives were regarded as worthy of emulation.[179] As of May 1972, the group began ordering all of those living under its control to dress like poor peasants, with black clothes, red-and-white krama scarves, and sandals made from car tyres. These restrictions were initially imposed on the Cham ethnic group before being rolled out across other communities.[180] Pol Pot also dressed in this fashion.[181]CPK members were expected to attend regular (sometimes daily) "lifestyle meetings" in which they engaged in criticism and self-criticism. These cultivated an atmosphere of perpetual vigilance and suspicion within the movement.[182] Pol Pot and Nuon Chea led such sessions at their headquarters, although they were exempt from criticism themselves.[183] By early 1972, relations between the Khmer Rouge and its Vietnamese Marxist allies were becoming strained and some violent clashes had broken out.[184] That year, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong main-force divisions began pulling out of Cambodia, primarily because they were needed for the offensive against Saigon.[185] As it became more dominant, the CPK imposed increasing numbers of controls over Vietnamese troops active in Cambodia.[186] In 1972, Pol Pot suggested that Sihanouk leave Beijing and tour the areas of Cambodia under CPK control. When Sihanouk did so, he met with senior CPK figures, including Pol Pot, although the latter's identity was concealed from the king.[187]In May 1973, Pol Pot ordered the collectivisation of villages in the territory it controlled.[188] This move was both ideological, in that it built a socialist society void of private property, and tactical, in that it allowed the Khmer Rouge greater control over the food supply, ensuring that farmers did not provision government forces.[189] Many villagers resented the collectivisation and slaughtered their livestock to prevent it from becoming collective property.[190] Over the following six months, about 60,000 Cambodians fled from areas under Khmer Rouge control.[189] The Khmer Rouge introduced conscription to bolster its forces.[191] Relations between the Khmer Rouge and the North Vietnamese remained strained. After the latter temporarily reduced the flow of arms to the Khmer Rouge, in July 1973 the CPK Central Committee agreed that the North Vietnamese should be considered "a friend with a conflict".[192] Pol Pot ordered the internment of many of the Khmer Rouge who had spent time in North Vietnam and were considered too sympathetic to them. Most of these people were later executed.[193]In summer 1973, the Khmer Rouge launched its first major assault on Phnom Penh, but was forced back amid heavy losses.[194] Later that year, it began bombarding the city with artillery.[195] In the autumn, Pol Pot traveled to a base at Chrok Sdêch on the eastern foothills of the Cardamom Mountains.[196] By winter, he was back at the Chinit Riber base where he conferred with secondnameplaceholdery and Chea.[197] He concluded that the Khmer Rouge should start talking openly about its commitment to making Cambodia a socialist society and launch a secret campaign to oppose Sihanouk's influence.[198] In September 1974, a Central Committee meeting was held at Meakk in Prek Kok commune.[198] There the Khmer Rouge agreed that it would expel the populations of Cambodia's cities to rural villages. They thought this was necessary to dismantle capitalism which they associated with the urban culture.[199]By 1974, Lon Nol's government had lost a great deal of support, both domestically and internationally.[200] In 1975, the troops defending Phnom Penh began discussing surrender, eventually doing so and allowing the Khmer Rouge to enter the city on 17 April.[201] There, Khmer Rouge soldiers executed between 700 and 800 senior government, military, and police figures.[202] Other senior figures escaped; Lon Nol fled into exile in the US.[203] He left Saukham Khoy as acting president, although he too fled aboard a departing US Navy ship just twelve days later.[204] Within the city, Khmer Rouge militia under the control of different Zone commanders clashed with one another, partly as a result of turf wars and partly due to the difficulty of establishing who was a group member and who was not.[205]The Khmer Rouge had long viewed Phnom Penh's population with mistrust, particularly as the city's numbers had been swelled by peasant refugees who had fled the Khmer Rouge's advance and were considered to be traitors.[206] Shortly after taking the city, the Khmer Rouge announced that its inhabitants had to evacuate to escape a forthcoming US bombing raid; the group falsely claimed that the population would be allowed to return after three days.[207] This evacuation entailed moving over 2.5 million people out of the city with very little preparation;[208] between 15,000 and 20,000 of these were removed from the city's hospitals and forced to march.[209] Checkpoints were erected along the roads out of the city where Khmer Rouge cadres searched marchers and removed many of their belongings.[210] The march took place in the hottest month of the year and an estimated 20,000 people died along the route.[211][205] For the Khmer Rouge, emptying Phnom Penh was considered as demolishing not just capitalism in Cambodia, but also Sihanouk's power base and the spy network of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This dismantling facilitated Khmer Rouge dominance over the country and enabled driving the urban population toward agricultural production.[212]
<h2>Leader of Kampuchea</h2>
On 20 April 1975, three days after Phnom Penh fell, Pol Pot secretly arrived in the abandoned city.[213] Along with other Khmer Rouge leaders, he based himself in the railway station, which was easy to defend.[214] In early May, they moved their headquarters to the former Finance Ministry building.[213] The party leadership soon held a meeting at the Silver Pagoda, where they agreed that raising agricultural production should be their government's top priority.[215] Pol Pot declared that "agriculture is key both to nation-building and to national defence";[215] he believed that unless Cambodia could develop swiftly then it would be vulnerable to Vietnamese domination, as it had been in the past.[216] Their goal was to reach 70 to 80% farm mechanisation in five to ten years, and a modern industrial base in fifteen to twenty years.[215] As part of this project, Pol Pot saw it as imperative that they develop means of ensuring that the farming population worked harder than before.[217]The Khmer Rouge wanted to establish Cambodia as a self-sufficient state. They did not reject foreign assistance altogether although regarded it as pernicious.[218] While China supplied them with substantial food aid, this was not publicly acknowledged.[218] Shortly after the taking of Phnom Penh, Ieng secondnameplaceholdery travelled to Beijing, negotiating the provision of 13,300 tons of Chinese weaponry to Cambodia.[219] At the National Congress meeting in April, the Khmer Rouge declared that it would not permit any foreign military bases on Cambodian soil, a threat to Vietnam, which still had 20,000 troops in Cambodia.[220] To quell tensions arising from recent territorial clashes with Vietnamese soldiers over the disputed Wai Island, Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng secondnameplaceholdery travelled secretly to Hanoi in May, where they proposed a Friendship Treaty between the two countries. In the short term, this successfully eased tensions.[221] After Hanoi, Pol Pot proceeded to Beijing, again in secret. There he met with Mao and then Deng.[222] Although communication with Mao was hindered by the reliance on translators, Mao warned the younger Cambodian against uncritically imitating the path to socialism pursued by China or any other country, and advised him to avoid repeating the drastic measures that the Khmer Rouge had imposed before.[223] In China, Pol Pot also received medical treatment for his malaria and gastric ailments.[224] Pol Pot then travelled to North Korea, meeting with Kim Il Sung.[224] In mid-July he returned to Cambodia,[225] and spent August touring the South-Western and Eastern Zones.[226]In May, Pol Pot adopted the Silver Pagoda as his main residence.[228] He then relocated to the city's tallest structure, the 1960s-built Bank Buildings, which became known as "K1".[229] Several other senior government figures—Nuon Chea, secondnameplaceholdery, and Vorn Vet—also lived there.[229] Pol Pot's wife, whose schizophrenia had worsened, was sent to live in a house in Boeung Keng Kâng.[229] Later in 1975, Pol Pot also took Ponnary's old family home in the rue Docteur Hahn as a residence, and subsequently also took a villa in the south of the city for his own.[229] To give his government a greater appearance of legitimacy, Pol Pot organised a parliamentary election, although there was only one candidate in every constituency except in Phnom Penh.[230] The parliament then met for only three hours.[231]Although Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge remained the de facto government, initially the formal government was the GRUNK coalition, although its nominal head, Penn Nouth, remained in Beijing.[232] Throughout 1975, the Communist Party's control over Cambodia was kept secret.[233] At a special National Congress meeting from 25–27 April, the Khmer Rouge agreed to make Sihanouk the nominal head of state,[234] a status he retained throughout 1975.[235] Sihanouk had been dividing his time between Beijing and Pyongyang but in September was allowed to return to Cambodia.[236] Pol Pot was aware that if left abroad, Sihanouk could become a rallying point for opposition and thus was better brought into the Khmer government itself; he also hoped to take advantage of Sihanouk's stature in the Non-Aligned Movement.[237] Once home, Sihanouk settled into his palace and was well treated.[238] Sihanouk was allowed to travel abroad, in October addressing the UN General Assembly to promote the new Cambodian government and in November embarking on an international tour.[239]The Khmer Rouge's military forces remained divided into differing zones and at a July military parade Pol Pot announced the formal integration of all troops into a national Revolutionary Army, to be headed by Son Sen.[232] Although a new Cambodian currency had been printed in China during the civil war, the Khmer Rouge decided not to introduce it. At the Central Committee Plenum held in Phnom Penh in September, they agreed that currency would lead to corruption and undermine their efforts to establish a socialist society.[240] Thus, there were no wages in Democratic Kampuchea.[241] The population were expected to do whatever the Khmer Rouge commanded of them, without pay. If they refused, they faced punishment, sometimes execution.[241] For this reason, Short characterised Pol Pot's Cambodia as a "slave state", with its people effectively forced into slavery by working without pay.[241] At the September Plenum, Pol Pot announced that all farmers were expected to meet a quota of three tons of paddy, or unmilled rice, per hectare, an increase on what was previously the average yield.[242] There he also announced that manufacturing should focus on the production of basic agricultural machinery and light industrial goods such as bicycles.[243]From 1975 on, all those living in rural co-operatives, meaning the vast majority of Cambodia's population, were reclassified as members of one of three groups: the full-rights members, the candidates, and the depositees.[244] The full-rights members most of whom were poor or lower-middle peasants, were entitled to full rations, and able to hold political posts in the co-operatives and join both the army and the Communist Party.[244] Candidates could still hold low-level administrative positions.[244] The application of this tripartite system was uneven and it was introduced to different areas at different times.[244] On the ground, the basic societal division remained between the "base" people and the "new" people.[244] It was never Pol Pot and the party's intention to exterminate all "new" people although the latter were usually treated harshly and this led some commentators to believe extermination was the government's desire.[244] Pol Pot instead wanted to double or triple the country's population, hoping it could reach between 15 and 20 million within a decade.[245]Within the village co-operatives, Khmer Rouge militia regularly killed those they deemed to be "bad elements".[246] A common statement used by the Khmer Rouge to those they executed was that "to keep you is no profit, to destroy you is no loss."[247] Those killed were often buried by the fields, to act as fertiliser.[246] During the first year of Khmer Rouge rule, most areas of the country were able to stave off starvation despite significant population increases caused by the evacuation of the cities. There were exceptions, such as parts of the North-West Zone and western areas of Kompong Chhnang, where starvation did occur in 1975.[248]The new Standing Committee decreed that the population would work ten day weeks with one day off from labor; a system modelled on that used after the French Revolution.[245] Measures were taken to indoctrinate those living in the co-operatives, with set phrases about hard work and loving Cambodia being widely employed, for instance broadcast via loudspeakers or on the radio.[249] Neologisms were introduced and everyday vocabulary was altered to encourage a more collectivist mentality; Cambodians were encouraged to talk about themselves in the plural "we" rather than the singular "I".[250] While working in the fields, people were typically segregated by sex.[251] Sport was prohibited.[251] The only reading material that the population were permitted to read was that produced by the government, most notably the newspaper Padevat ("Revolution").[251] Restrictions were placed on movement, with people permitted to travel only with the permission of the local Khmer Rouge authorities.[252]In January 1976, a cabinet meeting was held to promulgate a new constitution declaring that the country was to be renamed "Democratic Kampuchea".[253] The constitution asserted state ownership of the means of production, declared the equality of men and women, and the rights and obligation of all citizens to work.[253] It outlined that the country would be governed by a three-person presidium, and at the time Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge leaders expected that Sihanouk would take one of these roles.[253] Sihanouk was nevertheless increasingly uncomfortable with the new government and in March he resigned his role as head of state. Pol Pot tried repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, to get him to change his mind.[254] Sihanouk asked to be allowed to travel to China, citing the need for medical treatment, but this was denied. He was instead kept in his palace, which was sufficiently stocked with goods to allow him a luxurious lifestyle throughout the Khmer Rouge years.[255]The removal of Sihanouk ended the pretence that the Khmer Rouge government was a united front.[256] With Sihanouk no longer part of the government, Pol Pot's government stated that the "national revolution" was over and that the "socialist revolution" could begin, allowing the country to move towards pure communism as swiftly as possible.[257] Pol Pot described the new state as "a precious model for humanity" with a revolutionary spirit that outstripped that of earlier revolutionary socialist movements.[257] In the 1970s, Marxist–Leninism was at its strongest point in history,[258] and Pol Pot presented the Cambodian example as the one which other revolutionary movements should follow.[259]As part of the new Presidium, Pol Pot became the country's Prime Minister.[260] It was at this point that he took on the public pseudonym of "Pol Pot";[260] as no-one in the country knew who this was, a fictitious biography was presented.[261] Pol Pot's key allies took the other two positions, with Nuon Chea as President of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly and Khieu Samphân as the head of state.[262] In principle, the Khmer Rouge Standing Committee made decisions on the basis of the Leninist principle of democratic centralism.[263] In reality it was more autocratic, with Pol Pot's decisions being implemented.[263] The parliament which had been elected the previous year never met after 1976.[231] In September 1976, Pol Pot publicly revealed that Angkar was a Marxist–Leninist organisation.[264] In September 1977, at a rally in the Olympic Stadium, Pol Pot then revealed that Angkar was a pseudonym for the CPK.[265] In September 1976, it was announced that Pol Pot had stepped down as Prime Minister, to be replaced by Nuon Chea, but in reality he remained in power, returning to his former position in October.[266] This was possibly a diversionary tactic to distract the Vietnamese government while Pol Pot purged the CPK of individuals he suspected of harbouring Vietnamese sympathies.[267] Despite their Marxist pretences, the Khmer Rouge sought to eradicate the working class, seeing it as a "decadent relic of the past".[268] The Khmer Rouge also renounced communism in 1977, with Ieng secondnameplaceholdery stating "We are not communists ... we are revolutionaries [who do not] belong to the commonly accepted grouping of communist Indochina."[269]The Cambodian population were officially known as "Kampuchean" rather than "Khmer" to avoid the ethnic specificity associated with the latter term.[271] The Khmer language, now labelled "Kampuchean" by the government, was the only legally recognised language, and the Sino-Khmer minority were prohibited from speaking in the Chinese languages they commonly used.[251] Pressure was exerted on the Cham to culturally assimilate into the larger Khmer population.[251]Pol Pot initiated a series of major irrigation projects across the country.[272] In the Eastern Zone, for instance, a huge dam was built.[272] Many of these irrigation projects failed due to a lack of technical expertise on the part of the workers.[272]The Standing Committee agreed to link several villages in a single co-operative of 500 to 1000 families, with the goal of later forming commune-sized units twice that size.[231] Communal kitchens were also introduced so that all members of a commune ate together rather than in their individual homes.[273] Foraging or hunting for additional food was prohibited, regarded as individualistic behaviour.[274] From the summer of 1976, the government ordered that children over the age of seven would live not with their parents but communally with Khmer Rouge instructors.[275] The co-operatives produced less food than the government believed, in part due to a lack of motivation among laborers and the diversion of the strongest workers to irrigation projects.[276] Fearing criticism, many party cadres falsely claimed that they had met the government's food production quota.[277] The government became aware of this, and by the end of 1976 Pol Pot acknowledged food shortages in three quarters of the country.[277]Members of the Khmer Rouge received special privileges not enjoyed by the rest of the population. Party members had better food,[278] with cadres sometimes having access to clandestine brothels.[279] Members of the Central Committee could go to China for medical treatment,[280] and the highest echelons of the party had access to imported luxury products.[274]The Khmer Rouge also classified people based on their religious and ethnic backgrounds. Under the leadership of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge had a policy of state atheism.[281] Buddhist monks were viewed as social parasites and designated a "special class". Within a year of the Khmer Rouge's victory in the civil war, the country's monks were set to manual labor in the rural co-operatives and irrigation projects.[251]
Despite its ideological iconoclasm, many historical monuments were left undamaged by the Khmer Rouge;[282] for Pol Pot's government, like its predecessors, the historic state of Angkor was a key point of reference.[216]Several isolated revolts broke out against Pol Pot's government. The Khmer Rouge Western Zone regional chief Koh Kong and his followers began launching small-scale attacks on government targets along the Thai border.[283] There were also several village rebellions among the Cham.[283] In February 1976, explosions in Siem Reap destroyed a munitions depot. Pol Pot suspected senior military figures were behind the bombing and, although unable to prove who was responsible, had several army officers arrested.[284]In September 1976, various party members were arrested and accused of conspiring with Vietnam to overthrow Pol Pot's government.[285] Over the coming months the numbers arrested grew. The government invented claims of assassination attempts against its leading members to justify this internal crack-down within the CPK itself.[286] These party members were accused of being spies for either the CIA, the Soviet KGB, or the Vietnamese.[287] They were encouraged to confess to the accusations, often after torture or the threat of torture, with these confessions then being read out at party meetings.[288] As well as occurring in the area around Phnom Penh, trusted party cadres were sent into the country's zones to initiate further purges among the party membership there.[289]The Khmer Rouge converted a disused secondary school in Phnom Penh's Tuol Sleng region into a security prison, S-21. It was placed under the responsibility of the defence minister, Son Sen.[290] The numbers sent to S-21 grew steadily as the CPK purge proceeded. In the first half of 1976, about 400 people were sent there; in the second half of the year that number was nearer to 1000. By the spring of 1977, 1000 people were being sent there each month.[291] Between 15,000 and 20,000 people would be killed at S-21 during the Khmer Rouge period.[291] About a dozen of them were Westerners.[292] Pol Pot never personally visited S-21.[293]From late 1976 onward, and especially in the middle of 1977, the levels of violence increased across Democratic Kampuchea, particularly at the village level.[294] In rural areas, most of the killings were perpetrated by young cadres who were enforcing what they believed to be the government's will.[295] Across the country, peasant cadres tortured and killed members of their communities whom they disliked. Many cadres ate the livers of their victims and tore unborn foetuses from their mothers for use as kun krak talismans.[293] The CPK Central Command was aware of such practices but did nothing to stop them.[293] By 1977, the growing violence, coupled with poor food, was generating disillusionment even within the Khmer Rouge's core support base.[293] Growing numbers of Cambodians attempted to flee into Thailand and Vietnam.[296] In the autumn of 1977, Pol Pot declared the purges at an end.[297] According to the CPK's own figures, by August 1977 between 4000 and 5000 party members had been liquidated as "enemy agents" or "bad elements".[297]In 1978, the government initiated a second purge, during which tens of thousands of Cambodians were accused of being Vietnamese sympathisers and killed.[298] At this point the remaining CPK members who had spent time in Hanoi were killed, along with their children.[299] In January 1978, Pol Pot announced to his colleagues that their slogan should be "Purify the Party! Purify the army! Purify the cadres!"[300]Outwardly, relations between Cambodia and Vietnam were warm following the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea; after Vietnam was unified in July 1976, the Cambodian government issued a message of congratulations.[301] Privately, relations between the two were declining. In a speech on the first anniversary of their victory in the civil war, Khieu referred to the Vietnamese as imperialists.[302] In May 1976, a negotiation to draw up a formal border between the two countries failed.[302]On taking power, the Khmer Rouge spurned both the Western states and the Soviet Union as sources of support.[303] Instead, China became Cambodia's main international partner.[304] With Vietnam increasingly siding with the Soviet Union over China, the Chinese saw Pol Pot's government as a bulwark against Vietnamese influence in Indochina.[305] Mao pledged $1 billion in military and economic aid to Cambodia, including an immediate $20 million grant.[306] Many thousands of Chinese military advisors and technicians were also sent to the country to assist in projects like the construction of the Kampong Chhnang military airport.[307] The relationship between the Chinese and Cambodian governments was nevertheless marred by mutual suspicion and China had little influence on Pol Pot's domestic policies.[308] It had greater influence on Cambodia's foreign policy, successfully pushing the country to pursue rapprochement with Thailand and open communication with the U.S. to combat Vietnamese influence in the region.[309]After Mao died in September 1976, Pol Pot praised him and Cambodia declared an official period of mourning.[264] In November 1976, Pol Pot travelled secretly to Beijing, seeking to retain his country's alliance with China after the Gang of Four were arrested.[267] From Beijing, he was then taken on a tour of China, visiting sites associated with Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.[310] The Chinese were the only country allowed to retain their old Phnom Penh embassy.[253] All other diplomats were made to live in assigned quarters on the Boulevard Monivong. This street was barricaded off and the diplomats were not permitted to leave without escorts. Their food was brought to them and provided through the only shop that remained open in the country.[311] Pol Pot saw the Khmer Rouge as an example that should be copied by other revolutionary movements across the world and courted Marxist leaders from Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, allowing Thai Marxists to establish bases along the Cambodian border with Thailand.[258] In November 1977, Burma's Ne Win was the first foreign head of government to visit Democratic Kampuchea, followed soon after by Romania's Nicolae Ceaușescu.[312]Ben Kiernan estimates that 1.671 million to 1.871 million Cambodians died as a result of Khmer Rouge policy, or between 21% and 24% of Cambodia's 1975 population.[313] A study by French demographer Marek Sliwinski calculated slightly fewer than 2 million unnatural deaths under the Khmer Rouge out of a 1975 Cambodian population of 7.8 million; 33.5% of Cambodian men died under the Khmer Rouge compared to 15.7% of Cambodian women.[314] According to a 2001 academic source, the most widely accepted estimates of excess deaths under the Khmer Rouge range from 1.5 million to 2 million, although figures as low as 1 million and as high as 3 million have been cited; conventionally accepted estimates of deaths due to Khmer Rouge executions range from 500,000 to 1 million, "a third to one half of excess mortality during the period".[315] However, a 2013 academic source (citing research from 2009) indicates that execution may have accounted for as much as 60% of the total, with 23,745 mass graves containing approximately 1.3 million suspected victims of execution.[316]While considerably higher than earlier and more widely accepted estimates of Khmer Rouge executions, the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam)'s Craig Etcheson defended such estimates of over one million executions as "plausible, given the nature of the mass grave and DC-Cam's methods, which are more likely to produce an under-count of bodies rather than an over-estimate."[317] Demographer Patrick Heuveline estimated that between 1.17 million and 3.42 million Cambodians died unnatural deaths between 1970 and 1979, with between 150,000 and 300,000 of those deaths occurring during the civil war. Heuveline's central estimate is 2.52 million excess deaths, of which 1.4 million were the direct result of violence.[315][317] Despite being based on a house-to-house survey of Cambodians, the estimate of 3.3 million deaths promulgated by the Khmer Rouge's successor regime, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), is generally considered to be an exaggeration; among other methodological errors, the PRK authorities added the estimated number of victims that had been found in the partially-exhumed mass graves to the raw survey results, meaning that some victims would have been double-counted.[317]An estimated 300,000 Cambodians starved to death between 1979 and 1980, largely as a result of the after-effects of Khmer Rouge policies.[318]In December 1976, the Kampuchean Communist Party Central Committee's annual plenum proposed the country ready itself for the prospect of war with Vietnam.[310] Pol Pot believed that Vietnam was committed to expansionism and thus was a threat to Cambodian independence.[319] There were renewed border clashes between Cambodia and Vietnam in early 1977, continuing into April.[296] On 30 April, Cambodian units, backed by artillery fire, entered Vietnam and attacked a series of villages, killing several hundred Vietnamese civilians.[296] Vietnam responded by ordering its Air Force to bomb Cambodian border positions.[296] Several months later, the fighting resumed; in September, two divisions of the Cambodian Eastern Zone entered the Tay Ninh area of Vietnam, where they attacked several villages and slaughtered their inhabitants.[320] That month, Pol Pot travelled to Beijing, and from there to North Korea, where Kim Il Sung spoke out against Vietnam in solidarity with the Khmer Rouge.[321]In December, Vietnam sent 50,000 troops over the border along a 100-mile stretch, penetrating 12 miles into Cambodia.[322] Cambodia then formally broke off diplomatic relations with Vietnam.[323] Cambodian forces fought back against the invaders, who had withdrawn to Vietnam by 6 January 1978.[324] At this point, Pol Pot ordered Cambodia's military to take an aggressive, proactive stance, attacking Vietnamese troops before the latter had the chance to act.[325] In January and February 1978, the Cambodian Army launched raids on various Vietnamese villages.[326] The Vietnamese Politburo then concluded that it must not leave Pol Pot in power, but must remove him from power before the Cambodian military strengthened further.[324] In 1978, it established military training camps for Cambodian refugees in southern Vietnam, forming the nucleus of a future Cambodian regime.[327] The Cambodian government also readied itself for war. Plans for a personality cult revolving around Pol Pot were drawn up, based on the Chinese and North Korean models, in the belief that such a cult would unify the population in wartime.[328] Large photographs of Pol Pot began to be placed in communal dining halls,[329] while oil paintings and busts of him were produced.[330] The cult was ultimately never implemented.[312]The failure of Cambodian troops in the Eastern Zone to successfully resist the Vietnamese incursion made Pol Pot suspicious of their allegiances.[299] He ordered a purge of the Eastern Zone, with over 400 CPK cadres from the area being sent to S-21.[331] Aware that they would be killed on Pol Pot's orders, increasing numbers of Eastern Zone troops began rebelling against the Khmer Rouge government.[332] Pol Pot sent more troops into the Eastern Zone to defeat the rebels, ordering them to slaughter the inhabitants of any villages that were believed to be harbouring any rebel forces.[332] This suppression in the east was, according to Short, "the bloodiest single episode under Pol Pot's rule".[332] Fleeing the government troops, many leading rebels—including Zone deputy chiefs Heng Samrin and Pol secondnameplaceholderoeun—made it into Vietnam, where they joined the anti-Pol Pot exile community.[332] By August 1978, Pol Pot could only consider Mok's forces in the south-west and Pauk's in the Central Zone as being reliable.[333]Early in 1978, Pol Pot's government began trying to improve relations with various foreign countries, such as Thailand, to bolster its position against Vietnam.[334] Many other governments in Southeast Asia sympathised with Cambodia's situation, fearing the impact of Vietnamese expansionism and Soviet influence on their own countries.[335] Although supportive of the Cambodians, the Chinese government decided not to send its army into Cambodia, fearing that an all-out conflict with Vietnam could provoke a war with the Soviet Union.[336] Meanwhile, Vietnam was planning its full-scale invasion of Cambodia.[337] In December 1978, it formally launched the Khmer National United Front for National Salvation (KNUFNS), a group made up of Cambodian exiles which it hoped to install in place of the Khmer Rouge. Initially, KNUFNS was headed by Heng Samrin.[338] Fearing this Vietnamese threat, Pol Pot wrote an anti-Vietnamese tract titled the Black Paper.[333]In September 1978, Pol Pot began increasingly courting Sihanouk in the hope that the latter could prove a rallying point in support of the Khmer Rouge government.[339] That same month, Pol Pot flew to China to meet with Deng.[340] Deng condemned Vietnamese aggression but suggested that the Khmer Rouge had precipitated the conflict by being too radical in its policies and by allowing Cambodian troops to behave anarchically along the border with Vietnam.[325] On returning to Cambodia, in October Pol Pot ordered the country's army to switch tactics, adopting a defensive strategy involving the heavy use of land mines to stop Vietnamese incursions. He also cautioned the army to avoid direct confrontations which would incur heavy losses and instead adopt guerrilla tactics.[341] In November 1978, the CPK held its Fifth Congress. Here, Mok was appointed the third ranked figure in the government, behind Pol Pot and Nuon Chea.[342] Soon after the Congress, two senior government members—Vorn Vet and Kong Sophal—were arrested and sent to S-21. This precipitated another round of purges.[342]On 25 December 1978, the Vietnamese Army launched its full-scale invasion.[343] Its columns initially advanced into north-east Cambodia, taking Kratie on 30 December and Stung Treng on 3 January.[343] The Vietnamese main force then entered Cambodia on 1 January 1979, heading along Highways one and seven toward Phnom Penh.[343] Cambodia's forward defences failed to stop them.[344] With an attack on Phnom Penh imminent, in January Pol Pot ordered Sihanouk and his family to be sent to Thailand.[345] The entire diplomatic corps followed shortly after.[346] On 7 January Pol Pot and other senior government figures left the city and drove to Pursat.[347] They spent two days there before moving on to Battambang.[348]After the Khmer Rouge evacuated Phnom Penh, Mok was the only senior government figure left in the city, tasked with overseeing its defence.[347] Nuon Chear ordered the cadres in control of S-21 to kill all remaining inmates prior to it being captured by the Vietnamese.[349] However, the troops guarding the city were unaware how close the Vietnamese Army actually were;[349] the government had concealed the extent of the Vietnamese gains from the population.[350] As the Vietnamese approached, many officers and other soldiers guarding the city fled; the defence was highly disorganised.[351] There were isolated examples of Cambodian villagers killing Khmer Rouge officials in revenge.[352] In January, Vietnam installed a new government under Samrin, composed of Khmer Rouge who had fled to Vietnam to avoid the purges.[353] The new government renamed Cambodia the "People's Republic of Kampuchea".[354] Although many Cambodians had initially hailed the Vietnamese as saviours, over time resentment against the occupying force grew.[353]The Khmer Rouge turned to China for support against the invasion. secondnameplaceholdery travelled to China via Thailand.[348] There, Deng urged the Khmer Rouge to continue a guerrilla war against the Vietnamese and to establish a broad, non-communist front against the invaders, with a prominent role given to Sihanouk.[355]
China sent its vice premier, Geng Biao, to Thailand to negotiate the shipment of arms to the Khmer Rouge through Thailand.[356] China also sent diplomats to stay with the Khmer Rouge encampments near the Thai border. Pol Pot met with these diplomats twice before the Chinese government withdrew them for their safety in March.[357] In China, the Khmer Rouge set up their "Voice of Democratic Kampuchea" radio station, which remained their main outlet for communicating with the world.[348] In February, the Chinese attacked northern Vietnam, hoping to draw Vietnamese troops away from the invasion of Cambodia.[358] As well as China, the Khmer Rouge also received the support of the United States and most other non-Marxist southeast Asian countries who feared Vietnamese aggression as a tool of Soviet influence in the region.[359]On 15 January, the Vietnamese reached Sisophon.[356] Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Khieu Samphan then moved to Palin on the Thai side of the border, and in late January relocated again, to Tasanh, where secondnameplaceholdery joined them. There, on 1 February, they held a Central Committee conference, deciding against Deng's advice about a united front.[359] In the second half of March, the Vietnamese moved to hem in the Khmer Rouge along the Thai border, where many of Pol Pot's troops had crossed into Thailand itself.[360] The Vietnamese advanced on Tasanh, from which the Khmer Rouge leaders had fled only a few hours before it was captured.[361]
<h2>After Democratic Kampuchea</h2>
In July 1979, Pol Pot established a new headquarters, Office 131, on the western flank of Mount Thom.[362] He dropped the name "Pol Pot" and began calling himself "Phem".[362] In September 1979, Khieu announced that the Khmer Rouge was establishing a new united front, the Patriotic Democratic Front, bringing together all Cambodians who opposed the Vietnamese occupation.[363] Senior Khmer Rouge members began disavowing the cause of socialism.[364] The group members stopped wearing uniform black outfits; Pol Pot himself started wearing jungle green fatigues and later Thai-made safari suits.[364] Short believed that these changes reflected a genuine ideological shift in the Khmer Rouge.[364] In October, Pol Pot ordered an end to executions, a command which was largely followed.[364] In November 1979, the United Nations General Assembly voted to recognise the Khmer Rouge delegation, rather than that of the Vietnamese-backed government, as the legitimate government of Cambodia.[365] In December, Samphân replaced Pol Pot as prime minister of Democratic Kampuchea, a move that allowed Pol Pot to focus on the war effort and which was perhaps also designed to improve the Khmer Rouge's image.[366]During the monsoons of summer 1979, the Khmer Rouge troops began filtering back into Cambodia.[362] Many young Cambodians joined the Khmer Rouge forces, wanting to drive the Vietnamese Army out.[367] Boosted by the new Chinese supplies, the Khmer Rouge rebuilt its military structure in early 1980.[367] By mid-1980, the Khmer Rouge claimed it had 40,000 troops active in Cambodia.[367] From 1981, Pol Pot's main goal was to attract popular support among the Cambodian population, believing that this would be vital in enabling him to win the war.[368] In August 1981, he travelled, via Bangkok, to Beijing, where he met with Deng and Zhao Ziyang.[369] Deng had been pushing for Sihanouk, living in Pyongyang, to become Cambodian head of state, something the monarch had reluctantly agreed to in February 1981.[370] In September, Sihanouk, Samphân, and Son Sann issued a joint statement in Singapore announcing the formation of their own coalition government.[371]In December 1981, Pol Pot and Nuon Chea decided to dissolve the Communist Party of Kampuchea, a decision taken with very little discussion among the party's membership, some of whom were shocked.[373] Many outside commentators believed the dissolution was a ruse, and that the CPK was actually going underground once more, although Short noted that this was not the case.[371] Pol Pot proposed a new Movement of Nationalists that would replace the party, although this failed to fully materialise.[371] The CPK Standing Committee was replaced by a Military Directorate, the focus of which was on driving out the Vietnamese.[374] Pol Pot's decision to disband the party was informed by global events; his anti-Vietnamese army was backed by many capitalist countries while the Vietnamese were backed by most Marxist-governed countries. At the same time, he believed that his main Marxist backers, the Chinese, were themselves restoring capitalism with Deng's reforms.[368] Reflecting the ideological shift, among the Khmer Rouge, collective eating was ended, the ban on individual possessions was lifted, and children were again allowed to live with their parents.[375] Pol Pot commented that his previous administration had been too left-wing and claimed that it had made mistakes because he had placed too much trust in treacherous individuals around him.[375]In June 1982, at an event in Kuala Lumpur, the Khmer Rouge were among the factions declaring the formation of a Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) as an alternative to the administration in Phnom Penh.[376] On the ground in Cambodia there nevertheless remained little military collaboration between these factions, which included the Khmer Rouge as well as the Sihanoukist National Army and Son Senn's National Front for the Liberation of the Khmer People.[377] In 1983, Pol Pot travelled to Bangkok for a medical check-up; there he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease.[378] In mid-1984, Office 131 was moved to a new base further into Cambodia, near the O'Suosaday river.[378] In December, the Vietnamese Army launched a major offensive, overrunning the Khmer Rouge's Cambodian base and pushing Pol Pot back into Thailand. There, he established a new base, K-18, several miles outside Trat.[379]In September 1985, Pol Pot resigned as commander-in-chief of the Khmer Rouge forces in favour of Son Sen; he nevertheless continued to wield significant influence.[380] In the summer he married a young woman named Mea; the following spring their daughter, Sitha, was born.[380] He then travelled to Beijing to undergo cancer treatment at a military hospital, only returning to Cambodia in the summer of 1988.[381] In 1988, the anti-Vietnamese factions entered into negotiations with the Phnom Penh government.[382] Pol Pot deemed this too soon, for he feared that the Khmer Rouge had not gained sufficient popular support to produce significant gains in any post-war election.[383]The fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent end of the Cold War had repercussions for Cambodia. With the Soviet Union no longer a threat, the U.S. and its allies no longer saw Vietnamese domination of Cambodia as an issue. The U.S. announced that it no longer recognised the CGDK as the legitimate government of Cambodia at the UN General Assembly.[384] In June, the various Cambodian factions agreed a ceasefire, to be overseen by the United Nations, with the formation of a new Supreme National Council to facilitate the implementation of democratic elections.[385] Pol Pot agreed to these terms, fearing that if he refused the other factions would all unite against the Khmer Rouge.[385] In November, Sihanouk returned to Cambodia.[385] There, he praised the Vietnamese-backed leader, Hun Sen, and stated that the Khmer Rouge's leaders should be put on trial for their crimes.[386] When Samphân arrived in Phnom Penh with the Khmer Rouge's delegation, he was beaten by a mob.[386]Pol Pot established a new headquarters along the border, near Pailin.[386] He called on the Khmer Rouge to redouble their efforts in gaining support across Cambodia's villages.[387] In June, Samphân announced that in contravention of earlier agreements its troops would not disarm, stating that it refused to do so while Vietnamese soldiers remained in Cambodia.[388] The Khmer Rouge became increasingly confrontational, expanding its territory across western Cambodia.[388] It carried out massacres of the Vietnamese settlers who had recently arrived in the area.[388] Hun Sen's forces also carried out military activities, with UN peacekeepers proving ineffective in preventing the violence.[388] In January 1993, Sihanouk returned to Beijing, declaring that Cambodia was unprepared for elections.[388] The Khmer Rouge had formed a new party, the Cambodian National Union Party, through which it could take part in the election, but in March Pol Pot announced that they would boycott the vote.[389] At this point he moved his headquarters to Phnom Chhat; Samphân joined him there, having withdrawn his Khmer Rouge delegation from Phnom Penh.[390]In the May 1993 elections, Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC won 58 of the 120 available seats in the National Assembly; Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party came second. Sen, who was backed by the Vietnamese, refused to acknowledge defeat.[390] Sihanouk negotiated the formation of a coalition government between the two parties, introducing a system whereby Cambodia would have two prime ministers, Ranariddh and Sen.[390] The new Cambodian National Army then launched an offensive against the Khmer Rouge. By August, it had captured Phnom Chhat, with Pol Pot fleeing back into Thailand.[391] The Khmer Rouge launched a counter-offensive, having regained much of the territory they recently lost by May 1994.[391] Pol Pot moved to Anlong Veng, but as that was overrun in 1994 he relocated to Kbal Ansoang, on the crest of the Dangrek Mountains.[392] The Khmer Rouge nevertheless faced growing levels of desertion over the first half of the 1990s.[393]Pol Pot placed renewed emphasis on those living in Khmer Rouge territory imitating the lives of the poorest peasants and in 1994 ordered the confiscation of private transport and an end to cross-border trade with Thailand.[393] In September he ordered the execution of a Briton, a Frenchman, and an Australian who had been captured in a Khmer Rouge attack on a train.[394] In July 1996, a mutiny broke out among the Khmer Rouge and in August it was announced that Ieng secondnameplaceholdery, Y Chhean, and Sok Pheap were breaking away from the movement, taking troops loyal to them. This meant that around 4,000 soldiers left, almost halving the troop forces that the Khmer Rouge then commanded.[395] By the end of 1996, the Khmer Rouge had lost almost all the territory they held in the interior of Cambodia, being restricted to a few hundred miles along the northern border.[395] Pol Pot commented to his aides: "We are like a fish in a trap. We cannot last like this for very long".[395] Pol Pot's health was declining. He suffered from aortic stenosis and no longer had access to follow-up treatment for his earlier cancer.[393] A stroke left him paralysed on the left side of his body,[393] and he eventually required daily access to oxygen.[396] He spent increasing amounts of time with his family, in particular his daughter.[393]Pol Pot had grown suspicious of Son Sen and in June 1997 ordered his death. Khmer Rouge cadres subsequently killed Sen and 13 of his family members and aides; Pol Pot later stated that he had not sanctioned all of these killings.[397] Ta Mok was concerned that Pol Pot could turn on him too. Mok rallied troops loyal to him at Anlong Veng, informing them that Pol Pot had betrayed their movement and then headed to Kbal Ansoang.[397] Fearing Mok's troops, on 12 June Pol Pot, his family, and several bodyguards fled on foot. Pol Pot was very frail and had to be carried.[398] After Mok's troops apprehended them, Pol Pot was placed under house arrest.[399] Khieu Samphân and Nuon Chea sided with Mok.[399]While under house arrest American journalist Nate Thayer conducted the last interview with Pot where Pot stated that his "conscience is clear" but acknowledged that mistakes were made and told Thayer that "I want you to know that everything I did, I did for my country".[400] He also rejected the idea that millions had died saying "To say that millions died is too much" and that "You know, for the other people, the babies, the young ones, I did not order them to be killed".[401][402]In late July, Pol Pot and the three Khmer Rouge commanders who remained loyal to him were brought before a mass meeting near Sang'nam. Thayer was invited to film the event.[399] There, the Khmer Rouge sentenced Pol Pot to life imprisonment; the three other commanders were sentenced to death.[403] Three months later, Ta Mok permitted Thayer to visit and interview Pol Pot.[403]On 15 April 1998, Pol Pot died in his sleep of heart failure.[403] His body was preserved with ice after an improvised embalming with formaldehyde had failed, so that his death could be verified by journalists attending his funeral.[403][404][405][406] Three days later, his wife cremated his body on a pyre of tyres and rubbish, utilising traditional Buddhist funerary rites.[403] Thayer, who was present, claimed that Pol Pot killed himself when he became aware of Ta Mok's plan to hand him over to the United States, saying that "Pol Pot died after ingesting a lethal dose of a combination of Valium and chloroquine".[407][408][409]In May, Pol Pot's widow and Tep Khunnal fled to Malay, where they married.[410][411] The Khmer Rouge themselves continued to face territorial losses to the Cambodian Army and in March 1999 Ta Mok was also captured.[410]
<h2>Political ideology</h2>
Pol Pot considered himself a communist,[412] and described his CPK as adhering to a "Marxist–Leninist viewpoint", albeit one that had been adapted to Cambodian conditions.[413]  According to key Khmer Rouge figure Khieu Samphan, a key concept was "zero for him, zero for you - that is communism", in that in a society where all things were the possession of the state and no individual owned anything, everyone would be equal.[414]Pol Pot took up ideas of orthodox Marxism–Leninism but, contrary to Marx and Lenin's concepts, he believed in the ideal of an entirely self-sufficient and agrarian socialist society that would be entirely free from all foreign influences.[415] Joseph Stalin's work has been described as a "crucial formative influence" on Pol Pot.[416] Even more influential was the work of Mao Zedong, particularly his New Democracy.[60] Following Mao's thoughts and political example, in the mid-1960s Pol Pot reformulated his ideas about Marxism–Leninism to better suit the Cambodian situation.[125] Due to these alterations, various other Marxist–Leninists said that he was not truly adhering to Marxist–Leninist ideas.[413] In 1979, Deng for instance criticised the Khmer Rouge for engaging in "deviations from Marxism-Leninism".[348]In re-interpreting the revolutionary role of classes and questioning the Marxist focus on the proletariat, Pol Pot embraced the idea of a revolutionary alliance between the peasantry and the intellectuals, an idea that Short linked to his reading of Peter Kropotkin while he was in Paris.[417] Contrary to the principles of historical dialectics, he believed that peasants could develop a proletarian consciousness as an effect of the communist party's education of the masses, which resembles orthodox Marxist–Leninist thought.[418] In addition to that, Philip Short maintained that "the grammar of Theravada Buddhism permeated" Pol Pot's thought as much as Confucianism had influenced the development of Maoism in China.[417]Short also thought that the Khmer Rouge's ideology stood apart from other forms of Marxism due to its "monastic stress on discipline", with "the systematic destruction of the individual" being a "hallmark" of its ideology.[419] Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge believed that in order to crush the individualistic attitude that they thought was endemic in Cambodian society, coercion was needed to ensure the creation of a collectivised state.[420] Short noted that an underlying doctrinal view among the Khmer Rouge was that "it is always better to go too far than not far enough", an approach that was "at the root of many of the abuses" which occurred under their regime.[421] Within the Communist Party itself, hunger, lack of sleep, and long hours of labour were employed at training camps to ramp up the physical and mental pressure and thus facilitate indoctrination.[422] Short commented that "no other communist party" in history ever went "so far in its attempts directly to remould the minds of its members".[422]Pol Pot disbanded his Communist Party during the 1980s so as to emphasise a unified national struggle against Vietnamese occupation. That decade, Pol Pot commented that "We chose communism because we wanted to restore our nation. We helped the Vietnamese, who were communist. But now the communists are fighting us. So we have to turn to the West and follow their way."[368][411] This action led Short to suggest that "the veneer of Marxism-Leninism which had cloaked Cambodian radicalism had only ever been skin-deep."[368]Short observed that decision-making in Pol Pot's Cambodia was "unruly", making it dissimilar from the centralised, organised processes found in other Marxist–Leninist states.[423]
Within Democratic Kampuchea, there was much regional and local variation in how party cadres implemented Pol Pot's orders.[241]Pol Pot's government was totalitarian,[424] and he has been described as a dictator.[425]
Pol Pot desired autarky, or complete self-sufficiency, for Cambodia.[426] Short suggested that Pol Pot had been "an authentic spokesman" for the yearning that many Khmer felt for "the return of their former greatness", the era of the Khmer Empire.[427] Chandler noted that Pol Pot, like previous Cambodian leaders, emphasised the belief that Cambodia was purer than other nations.[428] The party leadership has been described as xenophobic.[429] Pol Pot repeatedly stated or implied that Cambodians were an intrinsically superior group to other ethnic or national groups and that they were immune to foreign influences.[430] Short also noted that the Khmer Rouge generally regarded foreigners as enemies; during the Cambodian civil war, they killed numerous foreign journalists whom they captured, whereas the Vietnamese Marxists typically let them go.[152] Native religions were banned as part of the Khmer Rouge's attempt to eliminate religion in the country.[431][432]
<h2>Personal life and characteristics</h2>
Pol Pot had a thirst for power.[433] He was introspective,[434] self-effacing,[435] and displayed self-control.[435] He was also highly reclusive,[5] obsessed with secrecy,[436] and fearful of the threat of assassination.[437] He was often in control while pretending not to be;[438] Short stated that he "delighted in appearing to be what he was not – a nameless face in the crowd".[439] During his political career, he used a wide array of pseudonyms: Pouk, Hay, Pol, 87, Grand-Uncle, Elder Brother, First Brother and in later years he used the pseudonyms 99 and Phem.[440] He told a secretary that "the more often you change your name the better. It confuses the enemy".[440] In later life he concealed and falsified many details of his life.[5] He never explained why he chose the pseudonym "Pol Pot".[167]Pol Pot displayed what Chandler called a "genteel charisma",[442] and what Short described as a "magnetic personality".[346] As a child, his brother characterized him as having been sweet tempered and equable, while fellow school pupils recalled that Pol Pot was mediocre but pleasant.[442] As a teacher, he was characterized by his pupils as having been calm, honest and persuasive,[442] having an "evident good nature and an attractive personality".[103] Chandler noted that he had the "common touch" when interacting with people;[443] according to Short, Pol Pot's varied and eclectic upbringing meant that he was "able to communicate naturally with people of all sorts and conditions, establishing an instinctive rapport that invariably made them want to like him".[444]  Many observers commented on his distinctive smile.[444] When speaking to audiences he usually carried a fan, which in Cambodian culture was traditionally associated with monkhood.[257]Pol Pot was softly spoken.[445] During speeches he was serene and calm, even in the midst of using violent rhetoric.[446] Chandler noted that when meeting with people, Pol Pot displayed an "apparent warmth" and was known for his "slowly uttered words".[447] Kong Duong, who worked with Pol Pot in the 1980s, said that he was "very likeable, a really nice person. He was friendly, and everything he said seemed very sensible. He would never blame you or scold you to your face."[445]Pol Pot suffered from insomnia[152] and was frequently ill.[437] He suffered from malaria and intestinal ailments, which left him ill several times a year whilst he was in power.[448] As well as having a love of traditional Khmer music,[393] in childhood he became interested in romantic French poetry, with the work of Paul Verlaine being among his favorites.[32]Chandler suggested that the seven years that Pol Pot primarily spent in jungle encampments among his fellow Marxists had a significant effect on his world-view, and they "probably reinforced his sense of destiny and self-importance".[449] Pol Pot had a nationalistic attitude and displayed little interest in events outside Cambodia.[434] He was self-righteous,[438] and typically rejected compromise or attempts to gain a consensus.[450]
Short related that "Pol did believe he was acting for the common good and that sooner or later everyone would recognise that."[451] Chandler noted that Pol Pot displayed "a tendency" towards violence and terror.[438]
Short suggested that Pol Pot, along with other senior members of the Khmer Rouge, engaged in the "glorification of violence" and saw bloodshed as a "cause for exultation". This, Short suggested, marked the Khmer Rouge's leadership out as being different from those who led the Chinese and Vietnamese Marxist movements, who tended to see violence as a necessary evil rather than something to embrace joyfully.[452]Pol Pot wanted his followers to develop a "revolutionary consciousness" that would allow them to act without his guidance and was often disappointed when they failed to display this.[453] Partly because he did not fully trust subordinates he micro-managed events, scrutinising things such as menus for state receptions or the programming schedules for radio broadcasts.[454] Although some of Pol Pot's supporters wanted a personality cult devoted to him akin to those in other Marxist-governed countries, this never successfully emerged in Cambodia. Although some busts and paintings of him were produced during the start of the war with Vietnam, Cambodia never saw songs and plays written about him, his photograph was not included in party literature, and there were no publication of his "thoughts", as had been seen with leaders in countries like China and North Korea.[330] Chandler thought that the proposed personality cult "never became full-blown" in large part because "self-advertisement did not come easily to Pol Pot."[329] It may also have reflected his sincere opposition to individualism.[330]
<h2>Reception and legacy</h2>
Chandler described Pol Pot as one of "the visionary leaders of Cambodian history" for his attempts to radically transform the country.[450] By 1979, his name was internationally recognised as a byword for mass killings and chaos.[455] In its obituary notice for Pol Pot, The New York Times referred to him as the creator of "one of the 20th century's most brutal and radical regimes".[456]
Both the BBC News and Time magazine blamed his government for "one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century".[457] In 2009, Deutsche Welle described Pol Pot's government as having initiated one of the "world's most infamous political experiments",[458] while Short referred to the Khmer Rouge as "the most radical revolutionary movement of modern times".[393] Writing for the U.S. socialist magazine Jacobin in 2019, the Dutch socialist Alex de Jong characterised Pol Pot's government as a "genocidal regime" and noted that the name of the Khmer Rouge had become "synonymous with murder and repression".[459] Many Cambodians who lived through his administration later referred to it as samai a-Pot ("the era of the contemptible Pot".)[460]The idea that the deaths which occurred under Pol Pot's government should be considered genocide was first put forward by the Vietnamese government in 1979 after the revelations of the killings committed at Tuol Sleng prison.[461] The Vietnamese-backed PRK administration swiftly opened the prison to visitors as the "Genocide Museum".[295] Short argued that while Pol Pot's administration was clearly responsible for crimes against humanity, it was misleading to accuse it of genocide because it never sought to eradicate an entire population.[461]Chandler noted that while "Cambodia's revolution" under Pol Pot produced "millions of victims", it also had some beneficiaries.[295] Those who were empowered by the Khmer Rouge administration either "probably believed" Pol Pot's claims regarding the construction of a socialist society or "vigorously pretended that they did", according to Chandler.[462] Chandler noted that Pol Pot's supporters believed that it was "his clear-sighted strategies and tactics that had wrested control of Cambodia from the United States and its feudal puppets" and that he had "uprooted enemies from the party, encouraged vigilance, built the alliance with China, and masterminded the Four Year Plan."[329] During the war with Vietnam, many Cambodians revered Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces as nationalists who were defending the country.[463] Internationally, his movement received support from such countries as China, Thailand, and the United States during that conflict because they saw it as a bulwark against Vietnam and thus Vietnam's key ally, the Soviet Union.[464]Various Marxist–Leninist groups endorsed Pol Pot's government while it was in power. The small Canadian Communist League (Marxist–Leninist), for instance, praised his government and sent a delegation to meet with him in Phnom Penh in December 1978.[465] Another sympathiser who visited Pol Pot that year was the Scottish communist Malcolm Caldwell, an economic historian based at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. He met with Pol Pot, but was murdered shortly afterward; the culprit was never identified.[466][467] Also in 1978, the Khmer Rouge met with delegates of the Swedish Cambodian Friendship Association, whose members openly sympathised with Pol Pot's regime.[468] One of its members, Gunnar Bergström, later noted that in the 1970s he had been a Marxist–Leninist who had become dissatisfied with the Soviet Union and believed that the Cambodian government was building a society based on freedom and equality.[469] In his view, the Khmer Rouge regime was "an example to the Third World".[468] Bergström noted that he and his fellow members had heard about atrocities that were taking place but "did not want to believe them".[469]

Theodore Robert secondnameplaceholder (born Cowell; November 24, 1946 – January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped, and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 homicides, committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His true victim total is unknown, and believed by some investigators to be higher.[3]secondnameplaceholder was regarded as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win the trust of victims and society. He would typically approach his victims in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before knocking them unconscious and taking them to secluded locations to rape and strangle them. He sometimes revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. He decapitated at least 12 victims and kept some of the severed heads as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.In 1975, secondnameplaceholder was arrested and jailed in Utah for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in Florida, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two trials.secondnameplaceholder was executed at Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida, on January 24, 1989.  Biographer Ann Rule described him as "a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death, and even after."[4] He once described himself as "the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet".[5][6] Attorney Polly Nelson, a member of his last defense team, agreed.  "firstnameplaceholder," she wrote, "was the very definition of heartless evil".[7]
<h2>Early life</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (1924–2012; known as Louise) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers[8] in Burlington, Vermont. His father's identity has never been confirmed. By some accounts his birth certificate assigns paternity to a salesman and Air Force veteran named Lloyd Marshall,[9] though according to others the father is listed as unknown.[10] Louise claimed she had been seduced by a war veteran named Jack Worthington,[11] and the King County Sheriff's Office has him listed as the father in their files.[12] Some family members expressed suspicions that secondnameplaceholder might have been fathered by Louise's own violent, abusive father, Samuel Cowell,[13] but no material evidence has ever been cited to support this.[14]For the first three years of his life, secondnameplaceholder lived in the Philadelphia home of his maternal grandparents, Samuel (1898–1983) and Eleanor Cowell (1895–1971), who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside of wedlock. Family, friends, and even young firstnameplaceholder were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. He eventually discovered the truth, although his recollections of the circumstances varied. He told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a "bastard",[15] but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth that he found the certificate himself.[10] Biographer and true crime writer Ann Rule, who knew secondnameplaceholder personally, believed that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont.[16] secondnameplaceholder expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.[17]In some interviews, secondnameplaceholder spoke warmly of his grandparents[18] and told Rule that he "identified with", "respected", and "clung to" his grandfather.[19] In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel Cowell was a tyrannical bully and a bigot who hated blacks, Italians, Catholics, and Jews, beat his wife and the family dog, and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. He once threw Louise's younger sister Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping.[20] He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences,[21] and at least once flew into a violent rage when the question of secondnameplaceholder's paternity was raised.[20]secondnameplaceholder described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent electroconvulsive therapy for depression[21] and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life.[22] secondnameplaceholder occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior at an early age. Julia recalled awakening from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the kitchen, and three-year-old firstnameplaceholder standing by the bed smiling.[23]In 1950, Louise changed her surname from Cowell to Nelson,[9] and at the urging of multiple family members, left Philadelphia with firstnameplaceholder to live with cousins Alan and Jane Scott in Tacoma, Washington.[24] In 1951, Louise met Johnny Culpepper secondnameplaceholder (1921–2007), a hospital cook, at an adult singles night at Tacoma's First Methodist Church.[25] They married later that year and Johnny secondnameplaceholder formally adopted firstnameplaceholder.[25] Johnny and Louise conceived four children of their own, and though Johnny tried to include his adopted son in camping trips and other family activities, firstnameplaceholder remained distant. He later complained to his girlfriend that Johnny wasn't his real father, "wasn't very bright", and "didn't make much money".[26]secondnameplaceholder varied his recollections of Tacoma in later years. To Michaud and Aynesworth, he described roaming his neighborhood, picking through trash barrels in search of pictures of naked women.[27] He told Polly Nelson that he perused detective magazines, crime novels, and true crime documentaries for stories that involved sexual violence, particularly when the stories were illustrated with pictures of dead or maimed bodies.[28] In a letter to Rule, however, he asserted that he "never, ever read fact-detective magazines, and shuddered at the thought" that anyone would.[29] He told Michaud that he would consume large quantities of alcohol and "canvass the community" late at night in search of undraped windows where he could observe women undressing, or "whatever [else] could be seen."[30]Accounts of his social life also varied. secondnameplaceholder told Michaud and Aynesworth that he "chose to be alone" as an adolescent because he was unable to understand interpersonal relationships.[31] He claimed that he had no natural sense of how to develop friendships. "I didn't know what made people want to be friends," he said. "I didn't know what underlay social interactions."[32] Classmates from Woodrow Wilson High School told Rule, however, that secondnameplaceholder was "well known and well liked" there, "a medium-sized fish in a large pond."[33]secondnameplaceholder's only significant athletic avocation was downhill skiing, which he pursued enthusiastically, using stolen equipment and forged lift tickets.[10] During high school, he was arrested at least twice on suspicion of burglary and auto theft. When he reached age 18, the details of the incidents were expunged from his record, as is customary in Washington and many other states.[34]After graduating from high school in 1965, secondnameplaceholder attended the University of Puget Sound (UPS) for one year before transferring to the University of Washington (UW) to study Chinese.[35] In 1967, he became romantically involved with a UW classmate who is identified by several pseudonyms in secondnameplaceholder biographies, most commonly Stephanie Brooks.[36] In early 1968, he dropped out of college and worked at a series of minimum-wage jobs. He also volunteered at the Seattle office of Nelson Rockefeller's presidential campaign[37] and became Arthur Fletcher's driver and bodyguard during Fletcher's campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Washington State.[38]In August, secondnameplaceholder attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami as a Rockefeller delegate.[39] Shortly thereafter Brooks ended their relationship and returned to her family home in California, frustrated by what she described as secondnameplaceholder's immaturity and lack of ambition. Psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis would later pinpoint this crisis as "probably the pivotal time in his development".[40] Devastated by Brooks's rejection, secondnameplaceholder traveled to Colorado and then farther east, visiting relatives in Arkansas and Philadelphia and enrolling for one semester at Temple University.[41] It was at this time in early 1969, Rule believed, that secondnameplaceholder visited the office of birth records in Burlington and confirmed his true parentage.[41][42]secondnameplaceholder was back in Washington by the fall of 1969 when he met Elizabeth Kloepfer (identified in secondnameplaceholder literature as Meg Anders, Beth Archer, or Liz Kendall), a divorcée from Ogden, Utah, who worked as a secretary at the University of Washington School of Medicine.[43] Their stormy relationship would continue well past his initial incarceration in Utah in 1976.[44]In mid-1970, secondnameplaceholder, now focused and goal-oriented, re-enrolled at UW, this time as a psychology major. He became an honor student and was well regarded by his professors.[45] In 1971, he took a job at Seattle's Suicide Hotline Crisis Center.  There, he met and worked alongside Ann Rule, a former Seattle police officer and aspiring crime writer who would later write one of the definitive secondnameplaceholder biographies, The Stranger Beside Me. Rule saw nothing disturbing in secondnameplaceholder's personality at the time; she described him as "kind, solicitous, and empathetic".[46]After graduating from UW in 1972,[47] secondnameplaceholder joined Governor Daniel J. Evans' re-election campaign.[48] Posing as a college student, he shadowed Evans's opponent, former governor Albert Rosellini, and recorded his stump speeches for analysis by Evans's team.[49][50] Evans appointed secondnameplaceholder to the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Committee.[51] After Evans was re-elected, secondnameplaceholder was hired as an assistant to Ross Davis, Chairman of the Washington State Republican Party. Davis thought well of secondnameplaceholder and described him as "smart, aggressive ... and a believer in the system".[52] In early 1973, despite mediocre LSAT scores, secondnameplaceholder was accepted into the law schools of UPS and the University of Utah on the strength of letters of recommendation from Evans, Davis, and several UW psychology professors.[53][54]During a trip to California on Republican Party business in the summer of 1973, secondnameplaceholder rekindled his relationship with Brooks. She marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional, seemingly on the cusp of a significant legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well; neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973, secondnameplaceholder matriculated at UPS Law School,[55] and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée.[26]In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact. Her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why secondnameplaceholder had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean", and hung up. She never heard from him again.[56] He later explained, "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her";[57] but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance, as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.[56]By then, secondnameplaceholder had begun skipping classes at law school. By April, he had stopped attending entirely,[58] as young women began to disappear in the Pacific Northwest.[59]
<h2>First two series of murders</h2>
There is no consensus on when or where secondnameplaceholder began killing women. He told different stories to different people and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution.[60] He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle.[61] He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia.[62][63]He hinted but refused to elaborate to homicide detective Robert D. Keppel that he committed a murder in Seattle in 1972,[64] and another murder in 1973 that involved a hitchhiker near Tumwater.[65] Rule and Keppel both believed that he might have started killing as a teenager.[66][67] Circumstantial evidence suggested that he may have abducted and killed eight-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma when he was 14 years old in 1961, an allegation that he repeatedly denied.[64] His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then, by his own admission, he had mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating forensic evidence at crime scenes.[68]Shortly after midnight on January 4, 1974 (around the time that he terminated his relationship with Brooks), secondnameplaceholder entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks[69] (identified as Joni Lenz,[70][71] Mary Adams,[72] and Terri Caldwell[73] by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning Sparks senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod[57][74] or a metal speculum,[71] causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days,[73] but survived with permanent physical and mental disabilities.[75] In the early morning hours of February 1, secondnameplaceholder broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.[76]During the first half of 1974, female college students disappeared at the rate of about one per month. On March 12, Donna Gail Manson, a 19-year-old student at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, 60 miles (95 km) southwest of Seattle, left her dormitory to attend a jazz concert on campus but never arrived. On April 17, Susan Elaine Rancourt disappeared while on her way to her dorm room after an evening advisors' meeting at Central Washington State College in Ellensburg, 110 miles (175 km) southeast of Seattle.[77][78] Two female Central Washington students later came forward to report encounters—one on the night of Rancourt's disappearance, the other three nights earlier—with a man wearing an arm sling, asking for help carrying a load of books to his brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.[79][80] On May 6, Roberta Kathleen Parks left her dormitory at Oregon State University in Corvallis, 260 miles (420 km) south of Seattle, to have coffee with friends at the Memorial Union, but never arrived.[81]Detectives from the King County and Seattle police departments grew increasingly concerned. There was no significant physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle.[82] On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. She was last seen in the parking lot, talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling.[83]In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house.[84] The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a criminalist combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing.[85] After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night in an alley behind a nearby dormitory. He was on crutches with a leg cast and was struggling to carry a briefcase.[86] One woman recalled that the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.[87] secondnameplaceholder later told Keppel that he lured Hawkins to his car before rendering her unconscious with a crowbar. He then handcuffed Hawkins and drove her to Issaquah, a suburb 20 miles (30 km) east of Seattle, where he strangled her and spent the entire night with her body.[88] secondnameplaceholder said that Hawkins regained consciousness inside his car, and said she had a Spanish test the following day and she "thought that I had taken her to help tutor her for the Spanish test". "It's not funny," he added, "but it's odd the kinds of things people will say under those circumstances".[89] He stated that he returned to the UW alley the morning after Hawkins's abduction and murder. There, in the very midst of a major crime scene investigation, he located and gathered Hawkins's earrings and one of her shoes, where he had left them in the adjoining parking lot, and departed, unobserved.[90] He admitted to revisiting Hawkins's corpse on three occasions.[91]During this period, secondnameplaceholder was working in Olympia as the Assistant Director of the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Commission (where he wrote a pamphlet for women on rape prevention).[92] Later, he worked at the Department of Emergency Services (DES), a state government agency involved in the search for the missing women. At DES he met and dated Carole Ann Boone, a twice-divorced mother of two who, six years later, would play an important role in the final phase of his life.[93]Reports of the six missing women and Sparks' brutal beating appeared prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon.[96] Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply.[97] Pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies,[98] but the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation.[99] Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, within a week of midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.[100]The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on July 14, with the broad daylight abductions of two women from a crowded beach at Lake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah.[101] Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as "firstnameplaceholder", he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him as far as his car, saw that there was no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation caseworker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story and watched her leave the beach in his company.[102] About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned.[103] secondnameplaceholder told both Stephen Michaud and William Hagmaier that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that he forced one to watch as he murdered the other[104][105][106]—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis on the eve of his execution.[107]King County police, finally armed with a detailed description of their suspect and his car, posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported secondnameplaceholder as a possible suspect;[108] but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day[109]—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.[110]On September 6, two grouse hunters stumbled across the skeletal remains of Ott and Naslund near a service road in Issaquah, 2 miles (3 km) east of Lake Sammamish State Park.[101][111] An extra femur and several vertebrae found at the site were later identified by secondnameplaceholder as those of Georgann Hawkins.[112] Six months later, forestry students from Green River Community College discovered the skulls and mandibles of Healy, Rancourt, Parks, and Ball on Taylor Mountain, where secondnameplaceholder frequently hiked, just east of Issaquah.[113] Manson's remains were never recovered.In August 1974, secondnameplaceholder received a second acceptance from the University of Utah Law School and moved to Salt Lake City, leaving Kloepfer in Seattle. While he called Kloepfer often, he dated "at least a dozen" other women.[115] As he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, "he was devastated to find out that the other students had something, some intellectual capacity, that he did not. He found the classes completely incomprehensible. 'It was a great disappointment to me,' he said."[116]A new string of homicides began the following month, including two that would remain undiscovered until secondnameplaceholder confessed to them shortly before his execution. On September 2, he raped and strangled a still-unidentified hitchhiker in Idaho, then either disposed of the remains immediately in a nearby river[117] or returned the next day to photograph and dismember the corpse.[118][119] On October 2, he seized 16-year-old Nancy Wilcox in Holladay, a suburb of Salt Lake City.[120] [121] Her remains were buried near Capitol Reef National Park, some 200 miles (320 km) south of Holladay, but were never found.[122]On October 18, Melissa Anne Smith—the 17-year-old daughter of the police chief of Midvale, another Salt Lake City suburb—disappeared after leaving a pizza parlor. Her nude body was found in a nearby mountainous area nine days later. Postmortem examination indicated that she may have remained alive for up to seven days following her disappearance.[123][124] On October 31, Laura Ann Aime, also 17, disappeared 25 miles (40 km) south in Lehi after leaving a café just after midnight.[125] Her naked body was found by hikers 9 miles (14 km) to the northeast in American Fork Canyon on Thanksgiving Day.[126] Both women had been beaten, raped, sodomized, and strangled with nylon stockings.[127][128] Years later, secondnameplaceholder described his postmortem rituals with the corpses of Smith and Aime, including hair shampooing and application of makeup.[129][130]In the late afternoon of November 8, secondnameplaceholder approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray,[131] less than a mile from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as "Officer Roseland" of the Murray Police Department and told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car. He asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out to secondnameplaceholder that he was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled onto the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the car door and escape.[132] Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, 20 miles (30 km) north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother.[133] The school's drama teacher and a student told police that "a stranger" had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play.[134] Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.[135]In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer called King County police a second time after reading that young women were disappearing in towns surrounding Salt Lake City. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, secondnameplaceholder had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify him from a photo lineup.[136] In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. secondnameplaceholder's name was added to their list of suspects, but at that time no credible forensic evidence linked him to the Utah crimes.[137] In January 1975, secondnameplaceholder returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.[138]In 1975, secondnameplaceholder shifted much of his criminal activity eastward, from his base in Utah to Colorado. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in Snowmass Village, 400 miles (640 km) southeast of Salt Lake City.[139] Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She had been killed by blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon.[140] On March 15, 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Snowmass, Vail ski instructor Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. secondnameplaceholder later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a secondary site near Rifle, 90 miles (140 km) west of Vail.[141][142] Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.[142][143]Denise Lynn Oliverson, 25, disappeared near the Utah–Colorado border in Grand Junction on April 6 while riding her bicycle to her parents' house; her bike and sandals were found under a viaduct near a railroad bridge.[144] On May 6, secondnameplaceholder lured 12-year-old Lynette Dawn Culver from Alameda Junior High School in Pocatello, Idaho, 160 miles (255 km) north of Salt Lake City. He drowned and then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room,[145] before disposing of her body in a river (possibly the Snake) north of Pocatello.[146][147]In mid-May, three of secondnameplaceholder's Washington State DES coworkers, including Carole Ann Boone, visited him in Salt Lake City and stayed for a week in his apartment. secondnameplaceholder subsequently spent a week in Seattle with Kloepfer in early June and they discussed getting married the following Christmas. Again, Kloepfer made no mention of her multiple discussions with the King County Police and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office. secondnameplaceholder disclosed neither his ongoing relationship with Boone nor a concurrent romance with a Utah law student known in various accounts as Kim Andrews[148] or Sharon Auer.[149]On June 28, Susan Curtis vanished from the campus of Brigham Young University in Provo, 45 miles (70 km) south of Salt Lake City. Curtis's murder became secondnameplaceholder's last confession, tape-recorded moments before he entered the execution chamber.[150] The bodies of Wilcox, Kent, Cunningham, Oliverson, Culver, and Curtis were never recovered.In August or September 1975, secondnameplaceholder was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, although he was not an active participant in services and ignored most church restrictions.[151][152][153] He would later be excommunicated by the LDS Church following his 1976 kidnapping conviction.[151] When asked his religious preference after his arrest, secondnameplaceholder answered "Methodist", the religion of his childhood.[154]In Washington state, investigators were still struggling to analyze the Pacific Northwest murder spree that had ended as abruptly as it had begun. In an effort to make sense of an overwhelming mass of data, they resorted to the then-innovative strategy of compiling a database. They used the King County payroll computer, a "huge, primitive machine" by contemporary standards, but the only one available for their use. After inputting the many lists they had compiled—classmates and acquaintances of each victim, Volkswagen owners named "firstnameplaceholder", known sex offenders, and so on—they queried the computer for coincidences. Out of thousands of names, 26 turned up on four lists; one was firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. Detectives also manually compiled a list of their 100 "best" suspects, and secondnameplaceholder was on that list as well. He was "literally at the top of the pile" of suspects when word came from Utah of his arrest.[155]
<h2>Arrest and first trial</h2>
On August 16, 1975, secondnameplaceholder was arrested by Utah Highway Patrol officer Bob Hayward in Granger (another Salt Lake City suburb).[156] Hayward observed secondnameplaceholder cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours, and fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car.[157] Hayward noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. secondnameplaceholder explained that the ski mask was for skiing, he had found the handcuffs in a dumpster, and the rest were common household items.[158] However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and secondnameplaceholder's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of secondnameplaceholder's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn[159] and a brochure that advertised the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful, where Debra Kent had disappeared.[160] The police did not have sufficient evidence to detain secondnameplaceholder, and he was released on his own recognizance. secondnameplaceholder later said that searchers missed a hidden collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released.[161]Salt Lake City police placed secondnameplaceholder on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle with two other detectives to interview Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to secondnameplaceholder's move to Utah, she had discovered objects that she "couldn't understand" in her house and in secondnameplaceholder's apartment. These items included crutches, a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house, and a meat cleaver that was never used for cooking. Additional objects included surgical gloves, an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment, and a sack full of women's clothing.[162] secondnameplaceholder was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected that he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he possessed. When she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, "If you tell anyone, I'll break your fucking neck."[163] She said secondnameplaceholder became "very upset" whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken in the middle of the night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a lug wrench, taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that secondnameplaceholder had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted.[164] Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to secondnameplaceholder around Christmas 1973.[165]In September, secondnameplaceholder sold his Volkswagen Beetle to a Midvale teenager.[166] Utah police impounded it, and FBI technicians dismantled and searched it. They found hairs matching samples obtained from Caryn Campbell's body.[167] Later, they also identified hair strands "microscopically indistinguishable" from those of Melissa Smith and Carol DaRonch.[168] FBI lab specialist Robert Neill concluded that the presence of hair strands in one car matching three different victims who had never met one another would be "a coincidence of mind-boggling rarity".[169]On October 2, detectives put secondnameplaceholder into a lineup. DaRonch immediately identified him as "Officer Roseland", and witnesses from Bountiful recognized him as the stranger at the high school auditorium.[170] There was insufficient evidence to link him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found, though a skeletal fragment found near the school was later identified as Kent's by DNA analysis[171]). There was more than enough evidence to charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents,[172] and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. "When firstnameplaceholder and I stepped out on the porch to go somewhere," Kloepfer wrote, "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500."[173]In November, the three principal secondnameplaceholder investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met in Aspen, Colorado, and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states.[174] While officials left the meeting (later known as the Aspen Summit) convinced that secondnameplaceholder was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could be charged with any of the murders.[175]In February 1976, secondnameplaceholder stood trial for the DaRonch kidnapping. On the advice of his attorney, John O'Connell, secondnameplaceholder waived his right to a jury due to the negative publicity surrounding the case. After a four-day bench trial and a weekend of deliberation, Judge Stewart Hanson Jr. found him guilty of kidnapping and assault.[176][148][177] In June he was sentenced to one-to-15 years in the Utah State Prison.[172] In October, he was found hiding in bushes in the prison yard carrying an "escape kit"—road maps, airline schedules, and a social security card—and spent several weeks in solitary confinement.[178] Later that month, Colorado authorities charged him with Caryn Campbell's murder. After a period of resistance, he waived extradition proceedings and was transferred to Aspen in January 1977.[179][180]
<h2>Escapes</h2>
On June 7, 1977, secondnameplaceholder was transported 40 miles (64 km) from the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a preliminary hearing. He had elected to serve as his own attorney, and as such, was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles.[182] During a recess, he asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case. While shielded from his guards' view behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped to the ground from the second story, injuring his right ankle as he landed. After shedding an outer layer of clothing, he walked through Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked southward onto Aspen Mountain. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle.[183] The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of Crested Butte, but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, he broke into a camping trailer on Maroon Lake, 10 miles (16 km) south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; but instead of continuing southward, he walked back north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way.[184] Three days later, he stole a car at the edge of Aspen Golf Course. Cold, sleep-deprived, and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days.[185] In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Caryn Campbell's body (as his own attorney, secondnameplaceholder had rights of discovery), indicating that his escape was not a spontaneous act, but had been planned.[186]Back in jail in Glenwood Springs, secondnameplaceholder ignored the advice of friends and legal advisors to stay put. The case against him, already weak at best, was deteriorating steadily as pretrial motions consistently resolved in his favor and significant bits of evidence were ruled inadmissible.[188] "A more rational defendant might have realized that he stood a good chance of acquittal, and that beating the murder charge in Colorado would probably have dissuaded other prosecutors ... with as little as a year and a half to serve on the DaRonch conviction, had firstnameplaceholder persevered, he could have been a free man."[189] Instead, secondnameplaceholder assembled a new escape plan. He acquired a detailed floor plan of the jail and a hacksaw blade from other inmates, and accumulated $500 in cash, smuggled in over a six-month period, he later said, by visitors—Carole Ann Boone in particular.[190] During the evenings, while other prisoners were showering, he sawed a hole about one square foot (0.093 m2) between the steel reinforcing bars in his cell's ceiling and, having lost 35 pounds (16 kg), was able to wriggle through it into the crawl space above.[191] In the weeks that followed, he made a series of practice runs, exploring the space. Multiple reports from an informant of movement within the ceiling during the night were not investigated.[192]By late 1977, secondnameplaceholder's impending trial had become a cause célèbre in the small town of Aspen, and secondnameplaceholder filed a motion for a change of venue to Denver.[193] On December 23, the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to Colorado Springs, where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects.[194] On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on furlough with their families,[195] secondnameplaceholder piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, and climbed into the crawl space. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife[196]—changed into street clothes from the jailer's closet, and walked out the front door to freedom.[197]After stealing a car, secondnameplaceholder drove eastward out of Glenwood Springs, but the car soon broke down in the mountains on Interstate 70. A passing motorist gave him a ride into Vail, 60 miles (97 km) to the east. From there he caught a bus to Denver, where he boarded a morning flight to Chicago. In Glenwood Springs, the jail's skeleton crew did not discover the escape until noon on December 31, more than 17 hours later. By then, secondnameplaceholder was already in Chicago.[198]
<h2>Florida</h2>
From Chicago, secondnameplaceholder traveled by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was present in a local tavern on January 2.[199] Five days later, he stole a car and drove south to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, on the morning of January 8. He stayed for one night at the Holiday Inn Hotel before he rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus.[200] secondnameplaceholder later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police;[201] but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification.[202] He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing money and credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts at local grocery stores.[203]In the early hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—secondnameplaceholder entered FSU's Chi Omega sorority house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism.[204] Beginning at about 2:45 a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking.[205] He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle.[206] In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger.[207] Chandler and Kleiner survived the attack; Kleiner attributed their survival to automobile headlights illuminating the interior of their room and frightening away the attacker.[208] Tallahassee detectives determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing.[204] After leaving the sorority house, secondnameplaceholder broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness, and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career.[209] On Thomas' bed, police found a semen stain and a pantyhose "mask" containing two hairs "similar to secondnameplaceholder's in class and characteristic".[210][211]On February 8, secondnameplaceholder drove 150 miles (240 km) east to Jacksonville, in a stolen FSU van. In a parking lot he approached 14-year-old Leslie Parmenter, the daughter of Jacksonville Police Department's Chief of Detectives, identifying himself as "Richard Burton, Fire Department", but retreated when Parmenter's older brother arrived and challenged him.[212] That afternoon, he backtracked 60 miles (97 km) westward to Lake City. At Lake City Junior High School the following morning, 12-year-old Kimberly Dianne Leach was summoned to her homeroom by a teacher to retrieve a forgotten purse; she never returned to class. Seven weeks later, after an intensive search, her partially mummified remains were found in a pig farrowing shed near Suwannee River State Park, 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Lake City.[213][214] She appeared to have been raped, then killed by neck lacerations with a knife.[215][216]On February 12, with insufficient cash to pay his overdue rent and a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him,[217] secondnameplaceholder stole a car and fled Tallahassee, driving westward across the Florida Panhandle. Three days later, at around 1:00 a.m., he was stopped by Pensacola police officer David Lee near the Alabama state line after a "wants and warrants" check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen.[218] When told he was under arrest, secondnameplaceholder kicked Lee's legs out from under him and took off running. Lee fired a warning shot followed by a second round, gave chase and tackled him. The two struggled over Lee's gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested secondnameplaceholder.[219] In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students, 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set.[220] Also found were a pair of dark-rimmed non-prescription glasses and a pair of plaid slacks, later identified as the disguise worn by "Richard Burton, Fire Department" in Jacksonville.[221] As Lee transported his suspect to jail, unaware that he had just arrested one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, he heard secondnameplaceholder say, "I wish you had killed me."[222]
<h2>Florida trials, marriage</h2>
Following a change of venue to Miami, secondnameplaceholder stood trial for the Chi Omega homicides and assaults in June 1979.[223] The trial was covered by 250 reporters from five continents and was the first to be televised nationally in the United States.[224] Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, secondnameplaceholder again handled much of his own defense. From the beginning, he "sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion", Nelson later wrote. "firstnameplaceholder [was] facing murder charges, with a possible death sentence, and all that mattered to him apparently was that he be in charge."[225]According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee public defender and member of the defense team, a pre-trial plea bargain was negotiated in which secondnameplaceholder would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because "prospects of losing at trial were very good."[226] secondnameplaceholder, on the other hand, saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a "tactical move": he could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal.[227][228] At the last minute, however, secondnameplaceholder refused the deal. "It made him realize he was going to have to stand up in front of the whole world and say he was guilty", Minerva said. "He just couldn't do it."[229]At trial, crucial testimony came from Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed secondnameplaceholder in the vicinity of the Chi Omega House that evening,[230] and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon.[231][232] Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds secondnameplaceholder had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of secondnameplaceholder's teeth.[233][234] The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979, of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.[235][236]Six months later, a second trial took place in Orlando, for the abduction and murder of Kimberly Leach.[237] secondnameplaceholder was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van.[238] Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket secondnameplaceholder was wearing when he was arrested.[239]During the penalty phase of the trial, secondnameplaceholder took advantage of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, in the presence of a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near secondnameplaceholder, had testified on his behalf during both trials, and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and secondnameplaceholder declared to the court that they were legally married.[240][241]On February 10, 1980, secondnameplaceholder was sentenced for a third time to death by electrocution.[242] As the sentence was announced, he reportedly stood and shouted, "Tell the jury they were wrong!"[243] This third death sentence would be the one ultimately carried out nearly nine years later.[244]In October 1981, Boone gave birth to a daughter and named secondnameplaceholder as the father.[245][14][246] While conjugal visits were not allowed at Raiford Prison, inmates were known to pool their money in order to bribe guards to allow them intimate time alone with their female visitors.[14][247]
<h2>Death row, confessions and death</h2>
Shortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, secondnameplaceholder initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth. Speaking mostly in third person to avoid "the stigma of confession", he began for the first time to divulge details of his crimes and thought processes.[248]He recounted his career as a thief, confirming Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned.[249] "The big payoff for me," he said, "was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken." Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well.[250] Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to "totally possess" his victims.[251] At first, he killed his victims "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [being] caught"; but later, murder became part of the "adventure". "The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life", he said. "And then ... the physical possession of the remains."[252]secondnameplaceholder also confided in Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier was struck by the "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" that secondnameplaceholder took in murder. "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... [the victim] becomes a part of you, and you [two] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them." secondnameplaceholder told Hagmaier that he considered himself to be an "amateur", an "impulsive" killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his "prime" or "predator" phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—although he never explicitly admitted to having done so.[253]In July 1984, Raiford guards found two hacksaw blades that secondnameplaceholder had hidden in his cell. A steel bar in one of the cell's windows had been sawed completely through at the top and bottom and glued back into place with a homemade soap-based adhesive.[254][255] Several months later, guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in the cell, and secondnameplaceholder was again moved to a different cell.[256]Shortly thereafter, he was charged with a disciplinary infraction for unauthorized correspondence with another high-profile criminal, John Hinckley Jr.[257] In October 1984, secondnameplaceholder contacted Robert Keppel and offered to share his self-proclaimed expertise in serial killer psychology[256] in the ongoing hunt in Washington for the "Green River Killer", later identified as Gary Ridgway.[258] Keppel and Green River Task Force detective Dave Reichert interviewed secondnameplaceholder, but Ridgway remained at large for a further 17 years.[259] Keppel published a detailed documentation of the Green River interviews,[260] and later collaborated with Michaud on another examination of the interview material.[261] secondnameplaceholder coined the nickname "The Riverman" for Gary Ridgway, which was later used for the title of Keppel's book, The Riverman: firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and I Hunt for the Green River Killer.[262]In early 1986, an execution date (March 4) was set on the Chi Omega convictions; the Supreme Court issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled.[263] In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, secondnameplaceholder finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was the full range of his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night.[143] In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless face, and he repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. "If you've got time," he told Hagmaier, "they can be anything you want them to be."[130] He decapitated approximately 12 of his victims with a hacksaw,[37][264] and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment for a period of time before disposing of them.[265]Less than 15 hours before the scheduled July 2 execution, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case for review on multiple technicalities—including secondnameplaceholder's mental competency to stand trial, and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6–6 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty[266]—which, ultimately, were never resolved.[267] A new date (November 18, 1986) was then set to carry out the Leach sentence; the Eleventh Circuit Court issued a stay on November 17.[267] In mid-1988, the Eleventh Circuit ruled against secondnameplaceholder, and in December the Supreme Court denied a motion to review the ruling. Within hours of that final denial, a firm execution date of January 24, 1989, was announced.[268] secondnameplaceholder's journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: "Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved secondnameplaceholder as fast as they could ... Even the prosecutors acknowledged that secondnameplaceholder's lawyers never employed delaying tactics. Though people everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was actually on the fast track."[269]With all appeal avenues exhausted and no further motivation to deny his crimes, secondnameplaceholder agreed to speak frankly with investigators. He confessed to Keppel that he had committed all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides for which he was the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities).[270] He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain,[271] but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things I did to [Kloepfer]," he told Keppel, "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz.")[272] "He described the Issaquah crime scene [where the bones of Ott, Naslund, and Hawkins were found], and it was almost like he was just there", Keppel said. "Like he was seeing everything. He was infatuated with the idea because he spent so much time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time."[273] Nelson's impressions were similar: "It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me," she wrote, "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments."[161]secondnameplaceholder confessed to detectives from Idaho, Utah, and Colorado that he had committed numerous additional homicides, including several that were unknown to the police. He explained that when he was in Utah he could bring his victims back to his apartment, "where he could reenact scenarios depicted on the covers of detective magazines."[37] A new ulterior strategy quickly became apparent: he withheld many details, hoping to parlay the incomplete information into yet another stay of execution. "There are other buried remains in Colorado", he admitted, but refused to elaborate.[274] The new strategy—immediately dubbed "firstnameplaceholder's bones-for-time scheme"—served only to deepen the resolve of authorities to see secondnameplaceholder executed on schedule, and yielded little new detailed information.[275] In cases where he did give details, nothing was found.[276] Colorado detective Matt Lindvall interpreted this as a conflict between his desire to postpone his execution by divulging information and his need to remain in "total possession—the only person who knew his victims' true resting places."[277]When it became clear that no further stays would be forthcoming from the courts, secondnameplaceholder supporters began lobbying for the only remaining option, executive clemency. Diana Weiner, a young Florida attorney and secondnameplaceholder's last purported love interest,[278] asked the families of several Colorado and Utah victims to petition Florida Governor Bob Martinez for a postponement to give secondnameplaceholder time to reveal more information.[279] All refused.[280] "The families already believed that the victims were dead and that firstnameplaceholder had killed them", wrote Nelson. "They didn't need his confession."[281] Martinez made it clear that he would not agree to further delays in any case. "We are not going to have the system manipulated", he told reporters. "For him to be negotiating for his life over the bodies of victims is despicable."[282]Boone had championed secondnameplaceholder's innocence throughout all of his trials and felt "deeply betrayed" by his admission that he was, in fact, guilty. She moved back to Washington with her daughter and refused to accept his phone call on the morning of his execution. "She was hurt by his relationship with Diana [Weiner]," Nelson wrote, "and devastated by his sudden wholesale confessions in his last days."[283]Hagmaier was present during secondnameplaceholder's final interviews with investigators. On the eve of his execution, he talked of suicide. "He did not want to give the state the satisfaction of watching him die", Hagmaier said.[229]secondnameplaceholder died in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16 a.m. EST on January 24, 1989. Hundreds of revelers sang, danced and set off fireworks in a pasture across from the prison as the execution was carried out,[284][285] then cheered as the white hearse containing secondnameplaceholder's corpse departed the prison.[286] He was cremated in Gainesville,[287] and his ashes scattered at an undisclosed location in the Cascade Range of Washington State, in accordance with his will.[288][289]
<h2>Modus operandiand victim profiles</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was an unusually organized and calculating criminal who used his extensive knowledge of law enforcement methodologies to elude identification and capture for years.[290] His crime scenes were distributed over large geographic areas; his victim count had risen to at least 20 before it became clear that numerous investigators in widely disparate jurisdictions were hunting the same man.[291] His assault methods of choice were blunt trauma and strangulation, two relatively silent techniques that could be accomplished with common household items.[292] He deliberately avoided firearms due to the noise they made and the ballistic evidence they left behind.[293] He was a "meticulous researcher" who explored his surroundings in minute detail, looking for safe sites to seize and dispose of victims.[294] He was unusually skilled at minimizing physical evidence.[68] His fingerprints were never found at a crime scene, nor any other incontrovertible evidence of his guilt, a fact he repeated often during the years in which he attempted to maintain his innocence.[295]Other significant obstacles for law enforcement were secondnameplaceholder's generic, essentially anonymous physical features,[296] and a curious chameleon-like ability to change his appearance almost at will.[297] Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him.[298] In person, "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't even sure you were looking at the same person", said Stewart Hanson Jr., the judge in the DaRonch trial. "He [was] really a changeling."[299] secondnameplaceholder was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary.[300] He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters.[301] Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.[302]secondnameplaceholder's modus operandi evolved in organization and sophistication over time, as is typical of serial killers, according to FBI experts.[37] Early on, it consisted of forcible late-night entry followed by a violent attack with a blunt weapon on a sleeping victim.[303] As his methodology evolved secondnameplaceholder became progressively more organized in his choice of victims and crime scenes. He would employ various ruses designed to lure his victim to the vicinity of his vehicle where he had pre-positioned a weapon, usually a crowbar. In many cases he wore a plaster cast on one leg or a sling on one arm, and sometimes hobbled on crutches, then requested assistance in carrying something to his vehicle. secondnameplaceholder was regarded as handsome and charismatic, traits he exploited to win the confidence of his victims and the people around him in his daily life.[102][304][305] "firstnameplaceholder lured females", Michaud wrote, "the way a lifeless silk flower can dupe a honey bee."[306] In situations where his looks and charm were not useful, he invoked authority by identifying himself as a police officer or firefighter. Once secondnameplaceholder had them near or inside his vehicle, he would overpower and bludgeon them, and then restrain them with handcuffs. He would then transport them to a pre-selected secondary site, often a considerable distance away, and strangle them by ligature during the act of rape.[307][37]At secondary sites he would remove and later burn the victim's clothing,[308] or in at least one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a Goodwill Industries collection bin.[309] secondnameplaceholder explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him.[308] (A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to Kimberly Leach.)[310] He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia,[311] and to groom or dress up the cadavers.[312] Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen.[313] He took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. "When you work hard to do something right," he told Hagmaier, "you don't want to forget it."[130] Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an "essential component", he told both Keppel and Michaud; he needed to be "extremely drunk" while on the prowl[314][315] in order to "significantly diminish" his inhibitions and to "sedate" the "dominant personality" that he feared might prevent his inner "entity" from acting on his impulses.[316] Toward the end of his spree, in Florida, perhaps under the stress of being a fugitive, he regressed to indiscriminate attacks on sleeping victims.[307]All of secondnameplaceholder's known victims were white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all were between the ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He apparently never approached anyone he might have met before.[290] (In their last conversation before his execution, secondnameplaceholder told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her "when he felt the power of his sickness building in him.")[317] Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long straight hair, parted in the middle—like Stephanie Brooks, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that secondnameplaceholder's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her.[318] secondnameplaceholder dismissed this hypothesis: "[T]hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive", he told Hugh Aynesworth. "Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ... [but] almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different."[319] He did concede that youth and beauty were "absolutely indispensable criteria" in his choice of victims.[320]After secondnameplaceholder's execution, Ann Rule was surprised and troubled to hear from numerous "sensitive, intelligent, kind young women", who wrote or called to say they were deeply depressed because secondnameplaceholder was dead. Many had corresponded with him, "each believing that she was his only one". Several said they suffered nervous breakdowns when he died. "Even in death, firstnameplaceholder damaged women," Rule wrote. "To get well, they must realize that they were conned by the master conman. They are grieving for a shadow man that never existed."[321]
<h2>Pathology</h2>
secondnameplaceholder underwent multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder,[322] but later changed her impression more than once.[4][323] She also suggested the possibility of a multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which secondnameplaceholder "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person ... [she] suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger."[21] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality ... that was the day I was afraid of him.'"[324]While experts found secondnameplaceholder's precise diagnosis elusive, the majority of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses,[325] and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).[326] secondnameplaceholder displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as "sociopaths" or "psychopaths"[327]), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade;[328] the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior;[329][330] and an absence of guilt or remorse.[328] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", secondnameplaceholder said, in 1981. "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not having to deal with guilt."[331] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody."[332] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist.[333] In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. "I never thought they existed ... but I think firstnameplaceholder may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all."[334] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.[335]On the afternoon before he was executed, secondnameplaceholder granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist and founder of the Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family.[336] He used the opportunity to make new claims about violence in the media and the pornographic "roots" of his crimes. "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it."[337] Violence in the media, he said, "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys "down the road to being firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholders."[338] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave.[7] "You are going to kill me," he said, "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."[338]While Nelson was apparently convinced that secondnameplaceholder's concern was genuine,[7] most biographers,[339][340][341] researchers,[342] and other observers[343] have concluded that his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic.[344] He told Dobson that "true crime" detective magazines had "corrupted" him and "fueled [his] fantasies ... to the point of becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [on only] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up."[345] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer.[346] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. "The problem was secondnameplaceholder."[347] "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," wrote Rule. "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us."[340]Rule and Aynesworth both noted that for secondnameplaceholder, the fault always lay with someone or something else. While he eventually confessed to 30 murders, he never accepted responsibility for any of them, even when offered that opportunity prior to the Chi Omega trial, which would have spared him the death penalty.[348] He deflected blame onto a wide variety of scapegoats, including his abusive grandfather, the absence of his biological father, the concealment of his true parentage, alcohol, the media, the police (whom he accused of planting evidence), society in general, violence on television, and, ultimately, true crime periodicals and pornography.[349] He blamed television programming, which he watched mostly on sets that he had stolen, for "brainwashing" him into stealing credit cards.[350] On at least one occasion, he even tried to blame his victims: "I have known people who ... radiate vulnerability", he wrote in a 1977 letter to Kloepfer. "Their facial expressions say 'I am afraid of you.' These people invite abuse ... By expecting to be hurt, do they subtly encourage it?"[351]A significant element of delusion permeated his thinking:"I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. "He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," she said.[346] "A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt," Keppel wrote, "walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached."[353] Nelson agreed. "Each time he was forced to make an actual confession," she wrote, "he had to leap a steep barrier he had built inside himself long ago."[354]
<h2>Victims</h2>
The night before his execution, secondnameplaceholder confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published estimates have run as high as 100 or more,[355] and secondnameplaceholder occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation.[294] He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder "publicized", there "could be one that was not."[356] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, secondnameplaceholder responded, "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it."[357] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate,[294] but Robert Keppel wrote that "[firstnameplaceholder] and I both knew [the total] was much higher."[67] "I don't think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered secondnameplaceholder's last rites. "That was my impression, my strong impression."[358]On the evening before his execution, secondnameplaceholder reviewed his victim tally with Bill Hagmaier on a state-by-state basis for a total of 30 homicides:[264]The following is a chronological summary of the 20 identified victims and five identified survivors:secondnameplaceholder remains a suspect in several unsolved homicides, and is likely responsible for others that may never be identified; in 1987 he confided to Keppel that there were "some murders" that he would "never talk about", because they were committed "too close to home", "too close to family", or involved "victims who were very young".[366]Minutes before his execution, Hagmaier queried secondnameplaceholder about unsolved homicides in New Jersey, Illinois, Vermont (the Curran case), Texas, and Miami, Florida. secondnameplaceholder provided directions—later proven inaccurate—to Susan Curtis's burial site in Utah, but denied involvement in any of the open cases.[382]In 2011, secondnameplaceholder's complete DNA profile, obtained from a vial of his blood found in an evidence vault, was added to the FBI's DNA database for future reference in these and other unsolved murder cases.[406]

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (born 9 July 1969) is a Dutch environmentalist and animal rights activist who was convicted for assassinating politician Pim Fortuyn, the leader of the right-wing Pim Fortuyn List (LPF), on 6 May 2002.[1] This occurred during the political campaign for the Dutch general elections of 2002.[2][3]He stated at his trial that he killed Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as scapegoats and targeting "the vulnerable sections of society" in seeking political power.[4][5] Graaf was arrested shortly after shooting Fortuyn, who died immediately. In court, Graaf testified that he had become alarmed that Fortuyn was using Muslims and immigrants as scapegoats in a campaign to seek political power. He thought the politician endangered society with his controversial statements. His trial started on 27 March 2003. He was convicted on 15 April 2003 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The trial generated large interest from the Dutch public, especially Fortuyn and right-wing Dutch supporters.[2] Graaf appealed for the reduction of the sentence to 16 years, but on 18 July 2003, the appeals court upheld the previous sentence.He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving 12 years, two-thirds of his sentence, according to Dutch practice.[6] His parole ultimately expired on 30 April 2020, giving release from the remaining restrictions.[7]
<h2>Family life and education</h2>
Van der Graaf was born in Middelburg, in the province of Zeeland. By the time he attended university in Wageningen, he had become a vegan and an advocate of animal rights. At the time of the murder he lived with his girlfriend and their infant daughter in Harderwijk.[8][9]
<h2>Career</h2>
Van der Graaf worked for the environmental organisation Vereniging Milieu Offensief in Wageningen, which he had co-founded in 1992. His job involved challenging violators of environmental regulations through litigation. He concentrated particularly on contesting practices in intensive animal farming and fur farming. He was said to be highly motivated, working more than the four days per week of his contract. He was successful at litigation, winning about three out of every four cases.[9]
<h2>Murder of Fortuyn</h2>
On 6 May 2002, Pim Fortuyn was shot outside a radio studio in Hilversum at 6:00 pm, just after he finished an interview. He was killed instantly. Interviewer Ruud de Wild witnessed the murder.Van der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as "firstnameplaceholder van der G.", in accordance with unwritten Dutch privacy practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on web sites used by Fortuyn's supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder.The details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn's appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of cartridges found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route.Van der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally: a semi-automatic Star Firestar M43 pistol in a café in Ede and 9mm cartridges in The Hague. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in Emmen through DNA material found on the weapon.On the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards Hilversum, knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of 3FM in the Media Park. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his stubble, which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving fingerprints. The razor did not work.He had never visited the Mediapark, relying on a map and a couple of photos to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn's interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn's car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn's interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours.Fortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn's ducking away or a bullet mistakenly hitting somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times, and fired a sixth shot that missed.Running away, Van der Graaf was chased by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Mediapark onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arm's length at Smolders, who had been reporting their position to the police by mobile phone. Reaching a gas station, Van der Graaf gave himself up when police pointed their pistols at him.[10]
<h2>Investigations and trial</h2>
For several months Van der Graaf refused to make any statement about the murder, on the advice of his lawyers. He was represented by Böhler, Koppe and Franken, with Böhler leading.In the months following the murder, many conspiracy theories were put forth by supporters of Fortuyn and others. Officials investigating the murder dismissed these popular rumours, declaring that no evidence had been found for the involvement of others.[citation needed] No evidence was found to support rumors that Van der Graaf had committed the earlier murder in 1996 of Chris Van der Werken, an environmental official from Nunspeet, or that he attended other appearances by Fortuyn.On 7 July 2006, the national daily newspaper De Telegraaf published an article alleging Van der Graaf's connection with the murder of Van der Werken. De Telegraaf printed extracts of a secret police report on the murder of Van der Werken on its website. Quirijn Meijnen, a Dutch-based media lawyer who represented Van der Graaf, said the accusations were grave and unfounded, and that the publication of extracts of the secret police report infringed Van der Graaf's privacy rights. De Telegraaf failed to mention that Van der Graaf was never a suspect in the murder case of Van der Werken.After Van der Graaf's arrest, he was held in strict isolation until 1 June. He could speak only to his lawyers and police and justice officials. He was kept under constant observation by video camera.[citation needed]A second search of Van der Graaf's home on 24 June found a chemical mixture, calcium chlorate and sugar, hidden in 35 condoms in his garage. Nearby were flasks of sulphuric acid. Experts said the substances could be combined to make a fire bomb or explosive material. Van der Graaf later said that he had fabricated the materials around 1990–1992 for experimentation purposes and had forgotten about them.[citation needed]The first "pro forma" hearing in his trial started on 9 August, which Van der Graaf watched on television from his cell in the Bijlmerbajes prison. The prosecution outlined its evidence, which included the finding of DNA matching Fortuyn on Van der Graaf's clothes and gun, matching of the bullets used in the attack with the gun, and eyewitnesses who pursued him continuously from the murder scene to the point of arrest. The defence complained that lack of discretion in reporting by the press and statements by public officials would make it difficult to obtain a fair trial. It requested calling as witnesses several politicians who had made public comments about the murder, including the past Prime Ministers Wim Kok and Jan Peter Balkenende, as well as various members of Lijst Pim Fortuyn including Herben and Janssen van Raay.On the morning of 3 September, Van der Graaf's girlfriend was arrested at her workplace in connection with the chemicals found at their former home. Her lawyer and the lawyers of Van der Graaf denounced this as an attempt to pressure Van der Graaf into making a statement. She was released two days later and eventually cleared of any suspicion after Van der Graaf made a statement on her behalf.[11]During a second "pro forma" hearing on 4 November, it was decided that the trial would be delayed while Van der Graaf was sent for seven weeks of psychiatric observation at the Pieter Baan Centre, starting in the first week of January 2003. In a press statement of 23 November, the prosecution (Public Ministry) announced that Van der Graaf had confessed to the murder. He said he planned it for some time and that nobody else was involved in the plans or knew about them. He believed Fortuyn was a steadily increasing danger for vulnerable groups in society. He saw no other possibility than to end the danger by killing Fortuyn.In response to the confession, Mat Herben said he was still not convinced that Van der Graaf had acted alone. Fortuyn's brother Marten said he was not surprised by the confession but feared that Van der Graaf was setting himself up as "saviour of the fatherland".The confession has not been made publicly available. Reports have asserted that Van der Graaf said he was "not proud" of the deed. He said if he could consider the decision again, he would not do it. He said that he did not see himself as "the saviour of the Netherlands" or as a martyr.[12]On 6 January 2003, Van der Graaf was moved to the Pieter Baan Centrum (PBC) to begin the seven-week behavioural investigation. Disagreements between the Ministry of Justice and the management of the PBC over the conditions of his supervision delayed it. The Ministry wanted Van der Graaf under video surveillance 24 hours per day and isolated from other patients for his own safety. The PBC believed such cameras would prevent establishing the trust needed for the multi-disciplinary behavioural investigation. It took responsibility to supervise him in a small group so that the investigation could proceed optimally. On 20 January, Van der Graaf said he was suspending his cooperation for the investigation. The Minister of Justice, Piet Hein Donner, resolved the dispute by dropping the demands for video surveillance and isolation.On January, 29th, 2003 a third "pro forma" hearing was held in which the dates for the trial were set. Since the subject of the trial was expected to be not so much the question of the guilt of Van der Graaf, but instead the degree of the punishment, the report of the Pieter Baan Centrum was considered highly significant, in case it found that he was of "diminished responsibilities". After the completion of the investigation on 14 March, he was returned to his prison cell in the Bijlmerbajes.The report from the PBC was complete by about 21 March. It found that Van der Graaf could be held completely accountable for the killing. The report also stated that Van der Graaf has a severe personality disorder,[13] which explains his rigid moral judgements. Menno Oosterhoff, a child psychiatrist from Groningen, publicly suggested that the Pieter Baan Centrum may have overlooked the possibility that Van der Graaf has Asperger syndrome. Oosterhoff later withdrew his theory. The PBC report stated that nothing could be said about the chance of another similar crime occurring, since the disorder had nothing to do with the murder. Van der Graaf agreed that he was accountable and that he had compulsive urges. The outcome of the investigation ensured that he would receive a prison sentence and not "TBS treatment".The trial was held in a high-security court in Amsterdam-Osdorp over three days: 27 March, 31 March, and 1 April. About 15 supporters of Fortuyn demonstrated outside the building, with banners such as "for less than 20 years we will smash the place up", "better fortuynist than socialist" and "the leftist church is criminal". The proceedings were followed by about 80 people, including a woman who disturbed the occasion by screaming at Van der Graaf, accusing him of such things as "destroying the whole of the Netherlands". Van der Graaf was counseled by the high-profile German-born attorney, Britta Böhler.Van der Graaf was charged with the premeditated murder of Fortuyn, two counts of possession of illegal weapons, namely the gun and the explosive mixture at his house, and a charge of threatening the life of Fortuyn's chauffeur by pointing his gun at him during the chase following the murder.The prosecutor asked for life imprisonment for the killing, saying that an example must be set for anybody else attempting to frustrate the democratic process through criminal means. He said the crime was serious because of its victim and the consequences, and that to a certain degree it was a "political murder". Van der Graaf had irrevocably damaged the democratic political progress of Fortuyn, and had done it intentionally. For an exceptional crime, he deserved an exceptional punishment.During the trial, Van der Graaf described his reasons for killing Fortuyn. He said he hoped that the leaders of other political parties would criticize Fortuyn, but that it never happened (which was not true). He claimed that Fortuyn had the talent to channel criticism so that it never touched him. Van der Graaf said he had spoken to no one about his plan. He finished his planning just the day before the murder. Perhaps looking for sympathy, he said he was wrestling with regret for the killing, finding the killing of somebody morally reprehensible. On 6 May he had felt justified, saying that he wanted to fight the danger of what Fortuyn represented, not the man. He did not find it easy to talk about feelings. Asked about the danger of accidentally injuring somebody other than Fortuyn in the attack, he said that he had been confident that that would not happen. The 3FM disc jockey Ruud de Wild said that he barely escaped with his life, as he received a bullet in the bag used for a shield.To the argument that Fortuyn would have been chosen through democratic means, Van der Graaf said that that was also the case for Hitler. He compared the rise of Fortuyn to the rise of Nazism in the 1930s.[2] In his final argument, he said that he had acted from his conscience, but that did not justify murder. He said it was absolutely not normal to shoot somebody to death.Van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to defend Dutch Muslims from persecution. He wanted to stop Fortuyn from targeting "the weak parts of society to score points" and exploiting Muslims as "scapegoats" in an attempt to seek political power.[14][15][16]Van der Graaf said that he would not have committed the murder, at least not on that evening, if Fortuyn had been accompanied by security guards; this is relevant to accusations that the government should have provided security.[citation needed] On Tuesday, 15 April 2003, Van der Graaf was convicted and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment.The prosecution and the defence both made appeals against the sentence. Prior to the appeal, suggestions in the media that Van der Graaf may have had Asperger syndrome were rejected by workers at the PBC. They said they had considered and rejected the possibility. A psychiatric report read in court said that Van der Graaf had an obsessive compulsive personality but was sane and could be held accountable for his actions.[17] The prosecution argued that the court had not taken account of the political nature of the murder, and asked again for life imprisonment. The defence argued that the sentence did not take account of the harsh conditions under which Van der Graaf had been held, nor the damage that had been done by unsubstantiated allegations that had appeared in the media (such as the connection with Van der Werken), and requested a reduction in sentence to 16 years. The appeals court accepted some of the arguments from both parties, and on 18 July 2003 reiterated the sentence to 18 years' imprisonment.
<h2>Release</h2>
Van der Graaf was released on parole on 2 May 2014, after having served two-thirds of his sentence as required by Dutch law.[18][19] The conditions of his parole were: weekly reporting to the probation service; a ban on visiting the places of residence of relatives of the victim or the municipal areas of Rotterdam, Hilversum and The Hague; location monitoring with an ankle bracelet with GPS; a ban on contacting the relatives of Fortuyn; a ban on communicating with the media; and compulsory meetings with a psychologist or psychiatrist.[20] He subsequently settled in Apeldoorn.[21]In July 2014, his lawyer Stijn Franken started legal proceedings against the terms of the parole. Van der Graaf was interested in becoming a legal advisor, and the restriction on visiting The Hague was unreasonable when so many legal organisations are based there. He also claimed that the restriction on communicating with the press was a violation of free speech, and that this and other restrictions were unnecessary when experts had found the risk of recidivism to be extremely low. He was partially successful, in that the travel restrictions and the ankle bracelet conditions were removed, but the media ban remained to "prevent unnecessary social unrest".[22][23] The government appealed the judgement, but it was upheld.[24]In 2017, Van der Graaf faced another court case in which the public prosecutor asked that he be returned to prison for a year for failing to sufficiently answer questions at probation meetings. However, on 6 February 2017 the court found that he had sufficiently met his probation requirements by appearing at the meetings.[25]In 2018, Van der Graaf again took legal action against the government over the terms of his parole, saying that the parole hearings prevented him from emigrating. The court ruled in his favour, and an appeal was withdrawn after a new arrangement was made: that Van der Graaf would report by email once every two months, until April 2020.[26] As of May 2019, he was still resident in Apeldoorn.[27]His parole expired on 30 April 2020, giving release from the remaining restrictions.[7]

firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, also known as Captain firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder or simply Captain secondnameplaceholder (c. 1655 – 23 May 1701),[1] was a Scottish sea captain who was commissioned as a privateer and had experience as a pirate. He was tried and executed in London in 1701 for murder and piracy.He had captured a French ship, commanded by an English captain, as a prize. He had been commissioned by the Crown as a privateer for this expedition, but the political climate of England turned against him in this case. Some modern historians, for example Sir Cornelius Neale Dalton, deem his piratical reputation unjust and say that he was acting as a privateer.[2] Documents found in the early 20th century in London court papers support secondnameplaceholder's account of his actions.
<h2>Biography</h2>
secondnameplaceholder was born in Greenock,[3] Scotland prior to October 15, 1654. While claims have been made of alternate birthplaces, including Dundee and even Belfast, secondnameplaceholder said on his way to the gallows that he was from Greenock. A local society supported the family financially after the death of the father.[4] The myth that his "father was thought to have been a Church of Scotland minister" has been discounted, insofar as there is no mention of the name in comprehensive Church of Scotland records for the period. Others still hold the contrary view.[5][6]As a young man, secondnameplaceholder later settled in the newly anglicized New York City, which the English took over from the Dutch.[7] There he befriended many prominent colonial citizens, including three governors.[8] Some accounts suggest that he served as a seaman's apprentice on a pirate ship during this time, before beginning his more famous seagoing exploits when he commanded privateers.By 1689, secondnameplaceholder was a member of a French–English pirate crew sailing the Caribbean under Captain Jean Fantin.[9] During one of their voyages, secondnameplaceholder and other crew members mutinied, ousting the captain and sailing to the British colony of Nevis.[10] There they renamed the ship Blessed firstnameplaceholder, and secondnameplaceholder became captain either as a result of election by the ship's crew, or by appointment of Christopher Codrington, governor of the island of Nevis.[11]Captain secondnameplaceholder, an experienced leader and sailor by that time, and the Blessed firstnameplaceholder became part of Codrington's small fleet assembled to defend Nevis from the French, with whom the English were at war.[12][13] The governor did not pay the sailors for their defensive service, telling them instead to take their pay from the French. secondnameplaceholder and his men attacked the French island of Marie-Galante, destroying its only town and looting the area, and gathering around 2,000 pounds sterling.Later, during the War of the Grand Alliance, on commissions from the provinces of New York and Massachusetts Bay, secondnameplaceholder captured an enemy privateer off the New England coast.[14] Shortly afterwards, he was awarded £150 for successful privateering in the Caribbean. One year later, Captain Robert Culliford, a notorious pirate, stole secondnameplaceholder's ship while he was ashore at Antigua in the West Indies.In 1695, firstnameplaceholder III of England appointed Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont, governor of New York in place of the corrupt Benjamin Fletcher, who was known for accepting bribes to allow illegal trading of pirate loot.[15]In New York City, secondnameplaceholder was active in financially supporting the construction of Trinity Church, New York.[16][17]On 16 May 1691, secondnameplaceholder married Sarah Bradley Cox Oort,[18] an English woman in her early twenties. She had already been twice widowed and was one of the wealthiest women in New York, based on an inheritance from her first husband.[19]On 11 December 1695, Bellomont was governing New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, and he asked the "trusty and well beloved Captain secondnameplaceholder"[20] to attack Thomas Tew, John Ireland, Thomas Wake, firstnameplaceholder Maze, and all others who associated themselves with pirates, along with any enemy French ships. His request had the weight of the Crown behind it, and secondnameplaceholder would have been considered disloyal, carrying much social stigma, to refuse Bellomont. This request preceded the voyage that contributed to secondnameplaceholder's reputation as a pirate and marked his image in history and folklore.Four-fifths of the cost for the 1696 venture was paid by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the Earl of Orford, the Baron of Romney, the Duke of Shrewsbury, and Sir John Somers. secondnameplaceholder was presented with a letter of marque, signed personally by King firstnameplaceholder III of England, which authorized him as a privateer. This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's The Book of Pirates suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. secondnameplaceholder and his acquaintance Colonel Robert Livingston orchestrated the whole plan; they sought additional funding from merchant Sir Richard Blackham.[21] secondnameplaceholder also had to sell his ship Antigua to raise funds.The new ship, Adventure Galley,[22] was well suited to the task of catching pirates, weighing over 284 tons burthen and equipped with 34 cannon, oars, and 150 men. The oars were a key advantage, as they enabled Adventure Galley to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. secondnameplaceholder took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those whom he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.Because of secondnameplaceholder's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by pressing much of secondnameplaceholder's crew into naval service, despite the captain's strong protests and the general exclusion of privateer crew from such action. Short-handed, secondnameplaceholder sailed for New York City, capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission). To make up for the lack of officers, secondnameplaceholder picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some likely former pirates.Among secondnameplaceholder's officers was quartermaster Hendrick van der Heul. The quartermaster was considered "second in command" to the captain in pirate culture of this era. It is not clear, however, if Van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility because secondnameplaceholder was authorized as a privateer. Van der Heul is notable because he may have been African or of African descent. A contemporary source describes him as a "small black Man". If Van der Heul was of African ancestry, he would be considered the highest-ranking black pirate or privateer so far identified. Van der Heul later became a master's mate on a merchant vessel and was never convicted of piracy.In September 1696, secondnameplaceholder weighed anchor and set course for the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa. A third of his crew died on the Comoros due to an outbreak of cholera, the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates whom he expected to encounter off Madagascar.With his ambitious enterprise failing, secondnameplaceholder became desperate to cover its costs. But, he failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and a New York privateer. Both were out of bounds of his commission. The latter would have been considered out of bounds because New York was not at war with the Crown, and secondnameplaceholder was authorized in part by the New York governor. Some of the crew deserted secondnameplaceholder the next time that Adventure Galley anchored offshore. Those who decided to stay on made constant open threats of mutiny.secondnameplaceholder killed one of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. secondnameplaceholder's gunner firstnameplaceholder Moore was on deck sharpening a chisel when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged secondnameplaceholder to attack the Dutchman, an act that would have been considered piratical, since the nation was not at war with England, but also certain to anger Dutch-born King firstnameplaceholder. secondnameplaceholder refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, "If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more." secondnameplaceholder reportedly dropped an ironbound bucket on Moore, fracturing his skull. Moore died the following day.[24]Seventeenth-century English admiralty law allowed captains great leeway in using violence against their crew, but outright killing was not permitted. secondnameplaceholder said to his ship's surgeon that he had "good friends in England, that will bring me off for that".[citation needed]Escaped prisoners told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and "drubbed" (thrashed) with a drawn cutlass by secondnameplaceholder. But on one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship Mary and tortured several of its crew members while secondnameplaceholder and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in secondnameplaceholder's cabin. When secondnameplaceholder found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.[citation needed]secondnameplaceholder was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer, to whom he had promised "thirty men or so".[20] secondnameplaceholder sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy impressment.[25] The letter of marque was intended to protect a privateer's crew from such impressment.On 30 January 1698, secondnameplaceholder raised French colours and took his greatest prize, the 400-ton Quedagh Merchant,[26][27] an Indian ship hired by Armenian merchants. It was loaded with satins, muslins, gold, silver, and an incredible variety of East Indian merchandise, as well as extremely valuable silks. The captain of Quedagh Merchant was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown.[28]After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, secondnameplaceholder tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners,[citation needed] but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal. secondnameplaceholder was commissioned to take French ships, and an Armenian ship counted as French if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, secondnameplaceholder relented and kept the prize. When news of his capture of this ship reached England, however, officials classified secondnameplaceholder as a pirate. Various naval commanders were ordered to "pursue and seize the said secondnameplaceholder and his accomplices" for the "notorious piracies" they had committed.[28]secondnameplaceholder kept the French sea passes of the Quedagh Merchant, as well as the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy. secondnameplaceholder may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep Quedagh Merchant and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman as Adventure Prize, he set sail for Madagascar.[citation needed]On 1 April 1698, secondnameplaceholder reached Madagascar. After meeting privately with trader Tempest Rogers (who would later be accused of trading and selling secondnameplaceholder's looted East India goods),[29] he found the first pirate of his voyage, Robert Culliford (the same man who had stolen secondnameplaceholder's ship at Antigua years before) and his crew aboard Mocha Frigate.Two contradictory accounts exist of how secondnameplaceholder proceeded. According to The General History of the Pirates, published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose identity is disputed by historians, secondnameplaceholder made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he "drank their Captain's health", swearing that "he was in every respect their Brother", and gave Culliford "a Present of an Anchor and some Guns".[30] This account appears to be based on the testimony of secondnameplaceholder's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial.The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain secondnameplaceholder. According to Zacks, secondnameplaceholder was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill-manned and ill-equipped to take Mocha Frigate until his two prize ships and crews arrived. He decided to leave Culliford alone until these reinforcements arrived. After Adventure Prize and Rouparelle reached port, secondnameplaceholder ordered his crew to attack Culliford's Mocha Frigate. However, his crew refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot secondnameplaceholder. Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.[31]Both accounts agree that most of secondnameplaceholder's men abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with Adventure Galley. Deciding to return home, secondnameplaceholder left the Adventure Galley behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. Before burning the ship, he salvaged every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the Adventure Prize.[32] Some of his crew later returned to North America on their own as passengers aboard Giles Shelley's ship Nassau.[32]Prior to returning to New York City, secondnameplaceholder knew that he was wanted as a pirate and that several English men-of-war were searching for him. Realizing that Adventure Prize was a marked vessel, he cached it in the Caribbean Sea, sold off his remaining plundered goods through pirate and fence firstnameplaceholder Burke,[33] and continued toward New York aboard a sloop. He deposited some of his treasure on Gardiners Island, hoping to use his knowledge of its location as a bargaining tool.[34] secondnameplaceholder landed in Oyster Bay to avoid mutinous crew who had gathered in New York City. To avoid them, secondnameplaceholder sailed 120 nautical miles (220 km; 140 mi) around the eastern tip of Long Island, and doubled back 90 nautical miles (170 km; 100 mi) along the Sound to Oyster Bay. He felt this was a safer passage than the highly trafficked Narrows between Staten Island and Brooklyn.[35][page needed]New York Governor Bellomont, also an investor, was away in Boston, Massachusetts. Aware of the accusations against secondnameplaceholder, Bellomont was afraid of being implicated in piracy himself and believed that presenting secondnameplaceholder to England in chains was his best chance to survive. He lured secondnameplaceholder into Boston with false promises of clemency,[36] and ordered him arrested on 6 July 1699. secondnameplaceholder was placed in Stone Prison, spending most of the time in solitary confinement. His wife, Sarah, was also arrested and imprisoned.The conditions of secondnameplaceholder's imprisonment were extremely harsh, and were said to have driven him at least temporarily insane.[37] By then, Bellomont had turned against secondnameplaceholder and other pirates, writing that the inhabitants of Long Island were "a lawless and unruly people" protecting pirates who had "settled among them".[37]After over a year, secondnameplaceholder was sent to England for questioning by the Parliament of England.[citation needed] The civil government had changed and the new Tory ministry hoped to use secondnameplaceholder as a tool to discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but secondnameplaceholder refused to name names, naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation that he may have been spared had he talked. Finding secondnameplaceholder politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the High Court of Admiralty in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of firstnameplaceholder Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, secondnameplaceholder was confined in the infamous Newgate Prison. He wrote several letters to King firstnameplaceholder requesting clemency.[citation needed]secondnameplaceholder had two lawyers to assist in his defence.[38] He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder. He was found guilty on all charges (murder and five counts of piracy) and sentenced to death. He was hanged in a public execution on 23 May 1701, at Execution Dock, Wapping, in London.[14] He had to be hanged twice. On the first attempt, the hangman's rope broke and secondnameplaceholder survived. Although some in the crowd called for secondnameplaceholder's release, claiming the breaking of the rope was a sign from God, secondnameplaceholder was hanged again minutes later, and died. His body was gibbeted over the River Thames at Tilbury Point – as a warning to future would-be pirates – for three years.[39]secondnameplaceholder's associates Richard Barleycorn, Robert Lamley, firstnameplaceholder Jenkins, Gabriel Loffe, Able Owens, and Hugh Parrot were also convicted of piracy. They were pardoned just prior to hanging at Execution Dock.[citation needed]secondnameplaceholder's Whig backers were embarrassed by his trial. Far from rewarding his loyalty, they participated in the effort to convict him by depriving him of the money and information which might have provided him with some legal defence. In particular, the two sets of French passes he had kept were missing at his trial. These passes (and others dated 1700) resurfaced in the early twentieth century, misfiled with other government papers in a London building.[40] These passes confirm secondnameplaceholder's version of events, and call the extent of his guilt as a pirate into question. Along with the papers, many goods were brought from the ships and soon auctioned off by the government as "pirate plunder". They were never mentioned in the trial.[citation needed]As to the accusations of killing Moore, he was largely convicted based on the testimony of two former crew members, Palmer and Bradinham. They testified against him in exchange for pardons. A deposition Palmer gave, when he was captured in Rhode Island two years earlier, contradicted his testimony. It may have supported secondnameplaceholder's assertions, but secondnameplaceholder was unable to obtain the deposition.[citation needed]A broadside song, "Captain secondnameplaceholder's Farewell to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament", was printed shortly after his execution. It popularised the common belief that secondnameplaceholder had confessed to the charges.[41]
<h2>Mythology and legend</h2>
The belief that secondnameplaceholder had left buried treasure contributed greatly to the growth of his legend. The 1701 broadside song "Captain Kid's Farewell to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament" lists "Two hundred bars of gold, and rix dollars manifold, we seized uncontrolled".[41][42]Several later American and Scots writers have referred to the legend in stories that related to this period: Edgar Allan Poe's "The Gold-Bug" (1843); Washington Irving's "The Devil and Tom Walker" (1824); Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (1881-1882), and Nelson DeMille's Plum Island (1997).[citation needed]It also inspired numerous treasure hunts conducted on Oak Island in Nova Scotia; in Suffolk County, Long Island in New York where Gardiner's Island is located; Charles Island in Milford, Connecticut; the Thimble Islands in Connecticut; Cockenoe Island in Westport, Connecticut;[43] and on the island of Grand Manan in the Bay of Fundy.[citation needed]Captain secondnameplaceholder did bury a small cache of treasure on Gardiners Island off the eastern coast of Long Island, New York, in a spot known as Cherry Tree Field. Governor Bellomont reportedly had it found and sent to England to be used as evidence against secondnameplaceholder in his trial.[44][45]Some time during the 1690s secondnameplaceholder visited Block Island, where he was given meals by Mrs. Mercy (Sands) Raymond, daughter of the mariner James Sands. It was said that secondnameplaceholder asked Mrs. Raymond to hold out her apron, and he filled it with gold and jewels as payment for her hospitality. After her husband Joshua Raymond died, Mercy moved with her family to northern New London, Connecticut (later Montville), where she bought much land. The Raymond family was said to have been "enriched by the apron".[46]On Grand Manan in the Bay of Fundy, as early as 1875, reference[example  needed] was made to searches on the west side of the island for treasure allegedly buried by secondnameplaceholder during his time as a privateer.[47] For nearly 200 years, this remote area of the island has been called "Money Cove".In 1983, Cork Graham and Richard Knight searched for Captain secondnameplaceholder's buried treasure off the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc. Knight and Graham were caught, convicted of illegally landing on Vietnamese territory, and each assessed a $10,000 fine. They were imprisoned for 11 months until they paid the fine.[48]
<h2>Quedagh Merchantfound</h2>
For years, people and treasure hunters tried to locate the Quedagh Merchant.[49] It was reported on 13 December 2007 that "wreckage of a pirate ship abandoned by Captain secondnameplaceholder in the 17th century has been found by divers in shallow waters off the Dominican Republic."[50] The waters in which the ship was found were less than ten feet deep and were only 70 feet (21 m) off Catalina Island, just to the south of La Romana on the Dominican coast. The ship is believed to be "the remains of the  Quedagh Merchant".[50][51] Charles Beeker, the director of Academic Diving and Underwater Science Programs in Indiana University (Bloomington)'s School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, was one of the experts leading the Indiana University diving team. He said that it was "remarkable that the wreck has remained undiscovered all these years given its location," and that the ship has been the subject of so many prior failed searches.[52] Captain secondnameplaceholder's cannon, an artifact from the shipwreck, was added to a permanent exhibit at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis in 2011.[53]
<h2>False find</h2>
In May 2015, a 50-kilogram (110 lb) ingot expected to be silver was found in a wreck off the coast of Île Sainte-Marie in Madagascar by a team led by marine archaeologist Barry Clifford. It was believed to be part of Captain secondnameplaceholder's treasure.[54][55][56] Clifford gave the booty to Hery Rajaonarimampianina, President of Madagascar.[57][58] But, in July 2015, a UNESCO scientific and technical advisory body reported that testing showed the ingot consisted of 95% lead, and speculated that the wreck in question might be a broken part of the Sainte-Marie port constructions.[59]
<h2>Portrayals in popular culture</h2>
Edgar Allan Poe uses the legend of secondnameplaceholder's buried treasure in his seminal detective story "The Gold Bug" (1843).The 1957 children's book Captain secondnameplaceholder's Cat by Robert Lawson is a largely fictionalized account of secondnameplaceholder's last voyage, trial and execution. It is told from the point of view of his loyal ship's cat. The book portrays secondnameplaceholder as an innocent privateer who was framed by corrupt officials as a scapegoat for their own crimes.Captain secondnameplaceholder appears as a character in "The Devil and Daniel Webster" (1936), a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét.In the manga and anime series One Piece, a character named Eustass "Captain" Kid refers to the historical Captain secondnameplaceholder.The character of Ogin, in the anime Girls und Panzer, strongly identifies with secondnameplaceholder, particularly with regard to her personality and leadership style. She commands a British Mark IV tank in "Das Finale".
(!!)Article(!/!)
Natascha Maria Kampusch (born 17 February 1988) is an Austrian woman who was abducted at the age of 10 on 2 March 1998 and held in a secret cellar by her kidnapper firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder for more than eight years, until she escaped on 23 August 2006. She has written a book about her ordeal, 3,096 Days (2010), which was later adapted into the 2013 German film 3096 Days.firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder ([ˈvɔlfɡaŋ ˈpr̝ɪklopɪl]; 14 May 1962 – 23 August 2006) was an Austrian communications technician of Czech origin. He was born to Karl and Waltraud secondnameplaceholder in Vienna, and was a single child. His father was a cognac salesman and his mother was a shoe saleswoman.[33] secondnameplaceholder worked at Siemens for a time as a communications technician.Evidence recovery was complicated, as secondnameplaceholder's only computer was a 1980s Commodore 64, which is incompatible with modern-day data-recovery programs.[34] Before Kampusch escaped, secondnameplaceholder was trying to procure false papers as a Czech citizen to "begin a new life" with Kampusch.[35]secondnameplaceholder knew that the police were after him, so he killed himself by jumping in front of a train near the Wien Nord station in Vienna. He had apparently planned to commit suicide rather than be caught, having told Kampusch, "they would not catch him alive".[36]
<h2>Early life</h2>
Kampusch was raised by her mother, Brigitta Sirny (née Kampusch), and her father, Ludwig Koch, in Vienna, Austria. Kampusch's family included two adult sisters, and five nieces and nephews. Sirny and Koch separated while Kampusch was still a child and divorced after her abduction. Kampusch spent time with both of them, and had returned to her mother's home from a holiday with Koch the day before her kidnapping.[1][2] At the time of her abduction, she was a student at the Brioschiweg primary school.[3]Ludwig Adamovich, head of a special commission looking into possible police failures in the investigation of the kidnapping, claimed that the time Kampusch was imprisoned  "was always better than what she had known until then."[4] This assessment was denied by Brigitta Sirny, and Adamovich's statement was found to be defamatory by a criminal court, and he was fined €10,000.[5] In Kampusch's 2010 book about her kidnapping, 3,096 Days, she stated that her parents slapped her, and that she was considering suicide on the day of her abduction.[6] However, Kampusch asserted that her mother was not abusive and that her home life was better than life in captivity.[6]
<h2>Kidnapping</h2>
The 10-year-old Kampusch left her family's residence in Vienna's Donaustadt district on the morning of 2 March 1998, but failed to arrive at school or come home. A 12-year-old witness reported having seen her being dragged into a white minibus by two men,[7][8] although Kampusch did not report a second man being present.[9] A massive police effort followed in which 776 minivans were examined,[10][11] including that of her kidnapper secondnameplaceholder, who lived about half an hour from Vienna by car in the Lower Austrian town of Strasshof an der Nordbahn near Gänserndorf. He stated that he was alone at home on the morning of the kidnapping, and the police were satisfied with his explanation that he was using the minibus to transport rubble from the construction of his home.[12]Speculations arose of child pornography rings or organ theft,[13] leading officials to also investigate possible links to the crimes of French serial killer Michel Fourniret.[14] Kampusch had carried her passport with her when she left, as she had been on a family trip to Hungary a few days before, so the police extended the search abroad. Accusations against Kampusch's family complicated the issue even more.[15]During the eight years of her captivity, Kampusch was held in a small cellar underneath secondnameplaceholder's garage. The entrance was concealed behind a cupboard. The cellar had only 5 m2 (54 sq ft) of space. It had a door made of concrete and was reinforced with steel. The room had no windows and was soundproof.[16] For the first six months of her captivity, Kampusch was not allowed to leave the chamber at any time, and for several years of her captivity, she was not allowed to leave the tiny space at night. Afterwards, she spent increasing amounts of time upstairs in the rest of the house, but each night was sent back to the chamber to sleep, as well as while secondnameplaceholder was at work.In later years, she was seen outside in the garden alone,[17] and secondnameplaceholder's business partner has said that Kampusch seemed relaxed and happy when  secondnameplaceholder and she called at his home to borrow a trailer.[18][19] After her 18th birthday, she was allowed to leave the house with secondnameplaceholder, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise.[20] He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours. She initially denied that they had made the trip, but eventually admitted that it was true, although she said that she had no chance to escape during that time.[21]According to Kampusch's official statement after her escape, secondnameplaceholder and she would get up early each morning to have breakfast together. secondnameplaceholder gave her books, so she educated herself. She did not feel that she had missed anything during her imprisonment, but she noted, "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company", but she also said, "It was a place to despair."[22]  She was given a television and radio to pass the time, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so that she would not be aware of the publicised search for her.[23] At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car.[22]A large portion of Kampusch's time upstairs was spent doing housework for secondnameplaceholder and cooking for him.[23] Dietmar Ecker, Kampusch's media advisor, said that secondnameplaceholder "would beat her so badly that she could hardly walk."[24] secondnameplaceholder would starve her to make her physically weak and unable to escape. Her body mass index had reached as low as 14.8 during captivity (normal BMI: 18.5 to 25).[23] Kampusch was also raped by secondnameplaceholder.[25][26]secondnameplaceholder had warned Kampusch that the doors and windows of the house were booby-trapped with high explosives. He also claimed to be carrying a gun and that he would kill her and the neighbours if she attempted to escape.[27] Nevertheless, Kampusch on one occasion fantasized about chopping his head off with an axe, although she quickly dismissed the idea.[28] She also attempted to make noise during her early years of captivity by throwing bottles of water against the walls.[28]
She said that on trips out with secondnameplaceholder, she had attempted to attract attention, but in vain.[28]The 18-year-old Kampusch escaped from secondnameplaceholder's house on 23 August 2006. At 12:53 pm, she was cleaning and vacuuming her kidnapper's automobile in the garden when secondnameplaceholder got a call on his mobile phone. Because of the vacuum's loud noise, he walked away to take the call. Kampusch left the vacuum cleaner running and ran away, unseen by secondnameplaceholder, who completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200 meters through neighboring gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on the window of a 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, "I am Natascha Kampusch".[29] The neighbour called the police, who arrived at 1:04 pm. Later, Kampusch was taken to the police station in the town of Deutsch-Wagram.Kampusch was identified by a scar on her body, by her passport (which was found in the room where she had been held), and by DNA tests.[30] She was in good physical health,[31] although she looked pale and shaken and weighed only 48 kg (106 lb); she weighed 45 kg (99 lb) when she disappeared eight years earlier. She grew only 15 cm (5.9 in) during her captivity.Sabine Freudenberger was the first police officer to speak to Kampusch after her ordeal, and she said that she was astonished by her "intelligence, her vocabulary".[citation needed] After two years, secondnameplaceholder had brought her books, newspapers, and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to Ö1, an ORF station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: "a deficit. So I wanted to make that better and I tried to educate myself, to teach myself skills. I have learned to knit, for example."[32]
<h2>Kidnapper</h2>
firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder ([ˈvɔlfɡaŋ ˈpr̝ɪklopɪl]; 14 May 1962 – 23 August 2006) was an Austrian communications technician of Czech origin. He was born to Karl and Waltraud secondnameplaceholder in Vienna, and was a single child. His father was a cognac salesman and his mother was a shoe saleswoman.[33] secondnameplaceholder worked at Siemens for a time as a communications technician.Evidence recovery was complicated, as secondnameplaceholder's only computer was a 1980s Commodore 64, which is incompatible with modern-day data-recovery programs.[34] Before Kampusch escaped, secondnameplaceholder was trying to procure false papers as a Czech citizen to "begin a new life" with Kampusch.[35]secondnameplaceholder knew that the police were after him, so he killed himself by jumping in front of a train near the Wien Nord station in Vienna. He had apparently planned to commit suicide rather than be caught, having told Kampusch, "they would not catch him alive".[36]
<h2>After the escape</h2>
In her official statement Kampusch said, "I don't want and will not answer any questions about personal or intimate details".[37] After Kampusch's escape, police investigated whether secondnameplaceholder had an accomplice,[38] but they eventually determined that he  acted alone.[39]Kampusch sympathised with her captor in the documentary Natascha Kampusch: 3096 days in captivity. She said, "I feel more and more sorry for him – he's a poor soul".[40] According to police, she "cried inconsolably" when she was told that he was dead,[41] and she lit a candle for him at the morgue.[42] She has, however, referred to her captor as a "criminal".[43]Newspapers quoting unnamed psychologists suggested that Kampusch might suffer from Stockholm syndrome,[44][45] but Kampusch says that this is not the case. She suggests that people who use this term about her are disrespectful of her and do not allow her the right to describe and analyse the complex relationship that she had with her kidnapper in her own words.After reportedly "hundreds of requests for an interview" with the teenager, "with media outlets offering vast sums of money", Kampusch was interviewed by Austrian public broadcaster ORF. The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval. ORF did not pay a fee for its interview[46] but agreed to forward any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels, forecasted to total 300,000 Euros[47] was to be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch.[48] Likewise she was planning projects to help these women.[49] Interest was enormous.[50]The newspaper Kronen Zeitung and newsweekly NEWS also interviewed Kampusch. The interview was published on 6 September 2006. Both press interviews were given in return for a package including housing support, a long-term job offer, and help with her education.[51]New developments in Kampusch's case challenged the Austrian government in February 2008.[52][53] Politicians of the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) threatened to break up the newly formed SPÖ–ÖVP ("red–black") coalition government in April and May 2008.[54] Kampusch said that she had lost confidence in Austrian justice. Revelations of mistakes in the interior ministry's investigation of her kidnapping came to light, as well as statements of a policeman that were repeatedly ignored in 1998.[citation needed]On 16 June 2008, the newspaper The Times published an in-depth interview with Kampusch by Bojan Pancevski and Stefanie Marsh.[55]On 17 February 2010, the British TV network Channel 5 broadcast an hour-long documentary about the case, including an exclusive interview with Kampusch:  Natascha: the Girl in the Cellar.[56][57]The book Girl in the Cellar: the Natascha Kampusch Story[58] by Allan Hall and Michael Leidig appeared in November 2006, written in English. Kampusch's lawyer described the book as being both speculative and premature, and therefore planned to take legal action against it.[59]Together with two journalists, Kampusch's mother Brigitta Sirny wrote a book about the ordeal, Verzweifelte Jahre ("Desperate Years"). Kampusch appeared at the initial presentation of the book in August 2007, but did not want to be photographed or interviewed. Sirny writes that she did not have much contact with Kampusch after the escape because Kampusch was shielded from the outside world.[60]Kampusch wrote a book about her ordeal, 3096 Tage (3096 Days), published in September 2010.[61] It was adapted into a movie, 3096 Days, in 2013.On 12 August 2016, Natascha Kampusch released her second book titled 10 Years of Freedom.[62][63]On 17 June 2010, German film-maker and director Bernd Eichinger announced that he was making a film based on Kampusch's captivity and wanted Kate Winslet to star in the film.[64] The film was Eichinger's last before his sudden death on 24 January 2011; Kampusch attended his funeral.[65]On 15 April 2012, German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported that the film would feature Antonia Campbell-Hughes as Kampusch and Thure Lindhardt as secondnameplaceholder.[66]
Ruth Toma completed Eichinger's unfinished screenplay and the film was directed by Sherry Hormann.[67] It was also cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's final film. The film 3096 Days (3096 Tage) was released on 28 February 2013.[68][69]In 2011, the Austrian film Michael, which has a plot that resembles the Natascha Kampusch case, was released.Kampusch established her own website containing personal information including pictures of herself on 5 December 2007.[70] She had her own talk show on the new Austria TV channel, PULS 4, starting on 1 June 2008. The show had the working title of In Conversation with…Natascha Kampusch and eventually premiered as Natascha Kampusch trifft (Natascha Kampusch meets...).[71][72] It ran for only three shows.The house where Kampusch was imprisoned was built by secondnameplaceholder's grandfather, Oskar secondnameplaceholder, after World War II.[33] During the Cold War period, Oskar and his son Karl built a bomb shelter, thought to be the origin of Kampusch's cellar prison. secondnameplaceholder took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death.Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, "I know it's grotesque – I must now pay for electricity, water, and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in." It was reported that she claimed the house from secondnameplaceholder's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape.[73] When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out.[74]In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence. In 2011, the cellar was filled in;[75]as of 2013[update] Kampusch still owned the house.[76]
